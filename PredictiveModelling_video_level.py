""" This script was going to be the predictive modelling task but at the video level using the metadata. However, this was not pursued.

Decision taken not to proceed for now due to success of model in the transcript chunk level task.
Essentially the predicitve modelling at transcript chunk level was deemed sufficient to id which videos without use of metadata given time too"""
