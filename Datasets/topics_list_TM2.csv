stx hasn't performed nearly as well as other altcoins and its price action also looks quite bizarre i suspect this is for two reasons first the distribution of the stx token is not very equitable even though the stax explorer doesn't actually show you wallet balances it's enough to know that no tokens were sold to the public during the stax ico the entirety of stx's initial supply was split between prived investors the stax foundation hira systems pbc and the project's founders these stx tokens have a fairly aggressive vesting schedule which is set to finish in october this year now given how much stx has appreciated compared to its sale price many of these tokens are probably being sold when you combine this cell pressure with the cell pressure coming from stax miners you need a lot of demand if you want prices to go higher now in theory this demand should be coming from those looking to stack stx and earn bitcoin but the costs required to do this solo are way too high and pooling stx with a third party is neither safe nor convenient for the time being what this means is that we might continue to see suppressed and sideways price action until the fall unless improvements are made to stacking or new dapps create new demand for stx however there seems to be some hope on the technical analysis side stx is printing either a bull flag or an ascending triangle on the daily time frame in either case we will likely see stx spike by 50 cents over the next few days the bearish news here is that when you zoom out on the weekly time frame you can see that people have consistently been taking profits at just above the two dollar mark as denoted by the tall wicks on top this is support for my thesis that cell pressure from miners vcs and founders is suppressing the price action of stx now if you want to learn how to do this with your favorite altcoin be sure to watch my videos about technical analysis and the first episode is hanging up there in the top right in terms of a roadmap staxx no longer has one and that's because the community decides what comes next stax community governance is coordinated by the stax foundation and all upcoming upgrades and milestones can be found on stack's governance github repository it appears that staxx is in the process of implementing fungible and non-fungible token standards which are a prerequisite for serious smart contract functionality and user adoption on that note stax has seemingly struggled with adoption despite having a solid project and raising nearly 100 million dollars in funding this is evident in the amount of stackers which is fewer than 300 for this 16-day cycle now this is concerning because these 300 stackers alone are stacking more than 30 percent of stx's circulating supply according to stacking club the next round of stacking will only see 250 of 3200 stacking slots filled now while i wasn't able to find any up-to-date statistics on how many miners there are right now in a february interview stacks founder munibali mentioned that there were just 46 miners on stacks besides the economic implications of this it also means that the stax blockchain itself is fairly centralized as far as i can tell the real reason why stacks has had such a hard time so far is because of the sec the sale of the stx token in 2019 was actually the first cryptocurrency ico to be sanctioned by the sec in the united states and the stax team went above and beyond to make it happen there's just one small problem and that's that doing the stx sale by the book within the united states meant that stx was automatically designated as a security by the sec without getting into the legal mumbo jumbo one of the side effects of stx being classified as a security is that it cannot be listed for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges inside the united states given that almost all of stack's infrastructure marketing and network effects are within the us a lack of exchange support for the stx token makes it difficult for fans of stacks in the us to participate in its ecosystem as miners stackers or users there is one caveat here and that's that the stax team has been working like mad to convince the sec to change its classification of the stx token from a security to a currency now that stacks 2.0 is live while it wasn't clear to me why stax and hiro systems had rebranded in october this makes a lot of sense when you consider the fact that this rebrand makes it easier for stx to be classified as a currency a green light from the sec seems to be the only thing preventing the buildup of institutional clients and investors in the united states from using stax and stx everything else already seems to be in place case in point coinbase already provides custody for the stx token and multiple u.s exchanges have signaled their readiness to list stx once it's cleared by the sec hirosystems recently filed its final annual report with the sec and has stated that it will no longer handle the stx token as a security now whether the sec feels the same way remains to be seen but once these floodgates are opened the adoption could be unprecedented for starters stax is built around a cryptocurrency that is seeing massive adoption by institutions and investors stax already has hundreds of apps for things like decentralized video streaming accounting and health record sharing most importantly institutions can trust the project because it was built in the united states by people from one of the world's top universities who held a token sale sanctioned by regulators according to stack's founder mani valley the real value that stacks will bring is sustainability to the bitcoin blockchain in 100 years or fewer the last btc will be mined now many have argued that transaction fees alone will be enough of an economic incentive to keep the bitcoin network going after that point however the fees for these transactions would need to be large and the transactions would need to be frequent if fees are large there will be fewer transactions and this would create a negative feedback loop that could kill bitcoin monieb argues that large and frequent transactions on the bitcoin blockchain is exactly what the stacks ecosystem will incentivize through its mining process if he's correct then stacks might actually be what bitcoin needs to maintain long-term security well into the future if you want to learn more about what happens after all the bitcoin is mined and a few of the other ways it could survive without transaction fees i happen to have a video about just that you know where to find it and if you forgot it's in the top right stax is a cryptocurrency project that has struggled to get the attention it deserves after all who wouldn't want to earn btc for securing a decentralized internet built on bitcoin it's a powerful proposition that should attract millions of people inside and outside of crypto"", ""so over the last month i've researched hundreds of different companies and this is my list of stocks i think should be on your watch list i encourage you to watch until the end to get my full analysis on each of these companies i'll go over key numbers recent news and why i expect them to grow in the long term now the housing market has entered what might be a small recession with some analysts calling it a potential repeat of the 2008 recession meanwhile inflation rates have reached historic highs and these price increases have compelled the federal reserve to raise interest rates of course nobody fully knows what's going to happen next but the best thing that you can do is just stay updated on the news and just dollar cost average into the market anyways let's get started so the first document we're talking about today is american express stock ticker axp amex is a multinational corporation well known for its payment card services so right now one share of axp is trading at 154 dollars in two cents with a 52-week low of 134.12 cents and a 52-week high of 199.55 cents if we take a look at the one-year price chart you can see that one year ago we were trading about 170 dollars per share we've seen some ups and some downs as well as hitting an all-time high of about 200 a share but since then it has corrected a little bit with a small recovery recently we have a market cap of 115.4 billion dollars a p ratio of 15.75 earnings per share of 9.78 and they do pay a small dividend of 1.35 percent yahoo finance has it listed as near fair value and if you take a look at the evaluation measures we can see that we have a five year expected peg ratio of 1.33 and a price book ratio of 4.91 the current profit margin is 15.86 percent and we have a return equity of 31.2 which is very strong this is on revenues of 47.96 billion dollars in the last 12 months and looking at their balance sheet they have total cash of 25.19 billion dollars with a strong current ratio of 1.63 their current dividend payout ratio is 19.43 now it's always interesting to see what analysts have to say so on a scale of one to five one being a strong buy and five being a sell analysts are rating amex as a 2.3 meaning it is a buy and the average analyst price target is 170 and 52 cents which is about 20 higher than the current price of 154 dollars in two cents so a recent report revealed the change in credit card spending among american express users with rapid increases in spending for airlines lodging and restaurants this is the first summer in years where the global market isn't significantly hindered by potential outbreaks and the result is a consumer market hungry for travel and spending now one of the biggest benefactors of this market boom will be credit card companies such as american express and we can see these benefits play out in the financials of the company amex recently announced second quarter earnings where the financial services company report a 31 year-over-year increase in total revenues net of interest expense we also can't ignore the fact that the company's total network volume grew by a whopping 28 year-over-year which indicates an increase in consumer usage and spending of their services steven squarey the ceo of american express expressed his confidence in amex's financial performance within a financial recession if one was going to happen he made it very clear that he didn't see a recession happening anytime soon in amex's earnings results really reflect confidence and durability in the company's ability to do business given the economic fears that many consumers have right now it would be more than reasonable to turn to a financial services company that is highly faithful in its own business and the state of the market as a whole overall i think that axp is definitely worth checking out the next stock on the list is umh properties stock ticker umh umh properties is a public real estate investment trust with a portfolio of well over 20 000 developed home sites throughout 10 states in america here you guys can see that one share of umh is trading at 21 and 31 cents with the 52 week low of 16 and 50 cents and a 52 week high of 27 and 50 cents here we have the one year price chart showing a relatively stable price between twenty two dollars and fifty cents and twenty seven dollars but a few months ago we did see a pretty big correction in the price of the stock followed by a swift recovery they have a market cap of one point one five six billion dollars a p ratio of a hundred six point five five which is very high earnings per share of 20 cents and they pay a great dividend of 3.75 looking at their valuation measures we see a price sales ratio of 5.59 and a price to book ratio of 3.75 their profit margin is currently 21.45 percent they have a return equity of 6.16 percent and this is on revenues of 188.71 million dollars in the last year look at their balance sheet we have total cash of 292.46 million dollars and a current ratio of 22.36 ants right now are writing it as a 1.7 meaning it is buy and the average analyst price target is 26.50 which is just over 20 higher than the current price of 21.31 all right so umh properties recently closed a deal acquiring yet another manufactured home community in erie michigan called hidden creek through the deal umh added another 351 developed home sites to its portfolio these home sites take up nearly 90 acres and are over 60 percent occupied so this recent acquisition shows that umh still has the means and the mindset to grow and expand its portfolio and satisfy its investors another way of assessing the credibility of this reit is by looking at who owns the stock if we look at the distribution of shareholders we can see that the vast majority of uma shareholders are institutional investors indicating that umh has high credibility amongst the biggest investors in the market this is definitely reassuring for retail investors like us but some of you are probably wondering why i encourage investing in the real estate investment trust when there is a big question mark in the housing market right now so first off reits tend to perform really well at the stage in the economic cycle with this graph in killing a 1700 percent return from reits since the late 80s but another attractive feature of umh is its dividend payments at the beginning of july umh declared common and preferred dividends with a quarterly cash dividend of 20 cents per share payable to shareholders at the close of business on august 15 2022."", ""but it's important to make sure you're starting on solid footing generally it's best to only invest after you've set aside some savings in an emergency fund and paid down any high interest debt having three to six months of living expenses on hand is helpful in case anything unexpected happens and paying down high interest debt is a guaranteed return that's hard to beat by anything that you'd invested taking care of those things first also allows you to take the long-term approach to investing there are years where the economy is doing well and the stock market is up in years where it's down if you're only investing money you don't need in the short term you can weather that volatility and know that long term growth is on your side also if you're investing money you might need soon it could put you in a position where you have to sell investments at a loss because you need to make a mortgage payment or pay a medical bill and nobody wants that that's all to say that temperament is key it is the most important thing when it comes to investing if you're going into things with the right mindset you can go ahead and open a brokerage account now choosing where to open a brokerage account will largely depend on what you're interested in investing in though it's hard to go wrong with the major discount brokers and major institutions like Vanguard if you want to run down of the major brokers check the description for a link of our broker Center opening a brokerage account is typically a quick and painless process that you can do in a matter of minutes you can easily fund your brokerage account via an EFT transfer by mailing a check or wiring money there are a couple things to keep in mind them first determine what kind of brokerage account you need for most people that are starting out this means choosing between a standard brokerage account or an individual retirement account the main consideration here is why you're investing and how easily you want to be able to access your money if you want easy access or are just investing for a rainy day you'll probably want a standard brokerage account on the other hand if your goal is to build up a retirement nest egg and IRA is a great way to go these accounts come in two varieties traditional or Roth traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax money which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute but the money you take retirement will be taxed Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars so there's no immediate tax benefit but you can withdraw the money tax-free in retirement if you're thinking in years go with the standard brokerage account if you're thinking in decades it might make sense to start an individual retirement account the great thing is you don't have to choose you can do both as long as you continue to save money and both account types will allow you to buy stocks mutual funds bonds and ETFs so that's what you need to start investing now on to what you can invest in when most people think investing they think stocks and bonds it's what they hear all the time in the news so we're gonna quick define both of them a stock is an equity stake in a business owning a share of a company means you're a part owner and you're entitled to a sliver of the company's profits if the business succeeds you enjoy your stake in the business being worth more a bond is really depth if you buy a bond you're loaning a sum of money to the issuer for a predetermined period of time in exchange the issuer promises to make regular interest payments at a predetermined rate until the bond comes due and then repay what you lent them upon maturity there are other ways to invest but stocks and bonds are generally the most common now you can put your money to work in stocks and bonds in several different ways you can buy individual stocks and bonds mutual funds that hold stocks and bonds and ETFs that holds Docs and bonds we're going to explore all three options and talk about the pros and cons of each one of the most popular investing vehicles out there is the mutual fund mutual funds are a collection of stocks bonds or other securities that investors can buy a share of and they're wildly popular because rather than having to choose individual stocks or bonds a single mutual fund can instantly give you a well diversified set of investments you can find mutual funds that invest in stocks bonds as well as other types of investments such as commodities within each category there are a variety of sub types such as growth stocks value stocks international stocks and a variety of risk levels if there's something you're interested in investing in there's probably a mutual fund for you most funds are available to all investors even those who only have modest amounts to invest which increases investing access for many beyond that basic definition if nothing else the thing you need to know about mutual funds is that they're actively managed mutual funds and index funds we generally prefer the latter actively managed funds have a manager who's trying to follow a specific strategy to try and provide superior returns unfortunately many of them don't succeed most research shows that due to short-term mindsets active trading and high fees actively managed funds tend to put up worse returns than the major stock market indices like the S&P 500 that's why many investors like us prefer to put our money into index funds an index fund managers job is to simply match the index the fund tracks which takes significantly less time and effort than the analysis and portfolio management involved with actively managed funds because of that index funds typically have significantly lower costs and are virtually guaranteed to match the long-term performance of their underlying index if you're interested in mutual funds be sure to keep an eye on the returns over the one three and five year period and how they compare to the S&P 500 or the funds relevant benchmark you should also look at the funds expense ratio basically how much you have to pay the person managing the fund if it's high the fund better be putting up better returns than the S&P 500 or its relevance benchmark net of fees mutual funds are great for beginners they allow you to instantly be diversified and you'll earn returns that beat most professional investors for example the sp500 mutual funds like the Vanguard V FedEx have allowed folks like you and me to instantly own a piece of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US enjoy annualized returns of 10 percent per year and pay very little to get started another very popular investing option for folks is the ETF or exchange-traded fund ETFs and mutual funds are basically siblings mutual funds are offered directly through mutual fund companies and many brokers also offer access to certain index mutual funds in their brokerage accounts ETFs trade directly on stock exchanges allowing anyone with a brokerage account to buy or sell shares at any point when the stock market is open for trade like mutual funds there are thousands of ETFs out there so it's important to understand what you're looking at when you're looking to buy the important metrics are also very similar to mutual funds if you want to look at your performance and your fees each ETF publishes an annual expense ratio which represents the percentage of the total fund assets that goes towards covering the cost that the ETF incurs every year smaller expense ratios mean more money staying in your pocket and the biggest and most efficient ETF providers have expense ratios for their funds that can be less than 0.1% some - ETFs are worth paying for but only because their returns beat their benchmark even when you factor in those fees if you're new to investing ETFs are a great place to start because they're widely available across brokerages and unlike some mutual funds there generally aren't account minimums associated with buying them ETFs and mutual funds allow the average investor to easily and cheaply be invested and diversified buying baskets of stocks and bonds at once rather than picking and choosing them one by one and because of that they are one of the best tools for new investors but they are not the only options most of us are used to borrowing money in some capacity whether it's mortgage on our homes or bumming a few bucks off a friend when we realize we've left our cash at home just as borrowing is a part of life for everyday people it's a practice companies and municipalities uphold as well even the federal government does it how by issuing bonds bonds come in several varieties corporate municipal and government though their nuances might differ they're all generally the same debt instruments used to raise money when an organization issues a bond it asks for a certain investment of money it then promises to pay back that investment plus interest over a specified period of time for example you might buy a 10 year $10,000 bond paying 3 percent Interest the issuer in exchange will promise to pay you interest on that $10,000 every six months and then return your $10,000 after 10 years there are two ways to make money by investing the bonds the first is to hold the bonds until their maturity date and collect interest payments on them bond interest is usually paid twice a year the second way to profit from bonds is to sell them at a price that's higher than what you pay initially for example if you buy $10,000 worth of bonds at face value meaning you paid $10,000 then sell them at $11,000 when their market value increases you can pocket the $1,000 difference stocks and ETFs are traded on public exchanges so they're fairly easy to buy and sell now bonds on the other hand aren't traded publicly but rather trade over-the-counter which means that investors must buy them from brokers the problem with the system is that because bond transactions don't occur in a centralized location investors can have a harder time knowing whether they're getting our price the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or FINRA regulates the bond market to some extent by posting transaction prices as that data becomes available but investors can sometimes experience a lag in getting that information this isn't a reason not to buy bonds but it's something to be aware of when it comes to bonds the things you want to focus on are the bond rating now this is a score of sorts that measures the financial strength of the entity issuing the bond there are three major bond rating agencies Standard & Poor's Moody's and Fitch and these agencies use a combination of letters numbers and symbols to indicate the creditworthiness of bond issuers ratings tend to follow the general grading system days are great and everything else that follows is professedly worse generally speaking the higher a bonds rating the safer it is as an investment but higher rated bonds also tend to offer lower interest rates than bonds with lower ratings and that's because investors are rewarded for taking on additional risk although bonds are generally considered a lower risk investment than stocks they are by no means risk-free all it takes is for a bond issuer to default and you as an investor will be out some money bonds generally offers stability and prick table income but they come with some disadvantages for one thing bonds require you to lock your money up for extended periods of time for example if you buy a bond with a 10-year term you're committing to keeping that money invested for 10 years and because bonds are a relatively long-term investment you'll face what's called interest rate risk when you buy them as we learned before each bond pays a certain amount of interest but what happens if you buy a 10-year bond paying 3% interest and then a month later that same issuer offers bonds at 4% suddenly your bond drops in value and if you hold it you'll lose out on potential earnings by getting stuck at that lower rate additionally bonds aren't all that conducive as long-term investments because they won't grow in the same way that's because the return on investment that you'll get with a bond is substantially lower than what you'll get with stocks consider this between 1928 and 2010 stocks averaged and 11.3% return while bonds averaged just a 5.3 percent return now imagine you're able to save three hundred dollars a month for retirement over a 30-year period if you load up on bonds an average that 5.3 percent return during that time you'll wind up with just over a 250,000 dollar nest egg but if you go with stocks instead and score an average annual eleven point three percent return on your investment you grow your retirement account to over 750,000 dollars and that's important because without that growth you'll have a hard time keeping up with inflation and maintaining your buying power when you're older we talked before about mutual funds and ETFs and how they give you access to hundreds of companies at once but what if you want to buy a specific company that's where buying individual stocks comes into the picture you can invest in individual stocks if and only if you have the time and desire to thoroughly research and evaluate stocks on an ongoing basis if this is the case we want a hundred percent encourage you to do so if not it's totally okay to stick with ETFs and mutual funds and call it a day this video is more of a broad stroke look at investing basics so we're not going to go super in-depth on how to pick individual stocks but we do have a lot of other content on the channel about that here are the important concepts you need to understand before you get started only invest in businesses you understand avoid high-risk stocks until you get the hang of investing and always avoid penny stocks start out with established growing businesses with market leading positions for example Apple and Disney are great beginner stocks they have businesses that are easy to understand Apple sells I products and has a software marketplace Disney makes movies media and owns theme parks plus they're growing profitable companies that aren't going to disappear overnight""]"

not buy a property if you have not factored in the transaction cost of buying and selling a house throughout the last two years it just seems like there's this mindset of buying a home getting to live there and then being able to sell it for a massive profit since prices keep going up but unfortunately this is the part of real estate that so many people don't think about until they're in the middle of a deal see as a renter it's so easy to fill out an application usually for free and you're done but when you're buying and selling this could often be a very expensive process that could cost you anywhere between four to seven percent of the home's value right off the bat like when you're buying a home you're gonna have to pay for inspections escrow charges loan origination fees and transaction costs not to mention a whole bunch of other miscellaneous charges that come up throughout the transaction like transfer taxes notary fees filing fees coordination transfer tax document certification fees it's just too many fees for me to talk about here without losing track of what i was talking about between all of this you could easily expect to pay anywhere from one to two and a half percent of the home's purchase price just for the opportunity of being able to buy so if you're purchasing something for three hundred thousand dollars expect to pay an extra three thousand to seventy five hundred dollars up front just for the privilege of getting to call at home in addition to that the transaction cost of selling is often significantly higher when everything is said and done selling a home could easily cost you another four to six percent of the home's value from start to finish that means just to break even on the purchase you're gonna have to sell your home seven percent higher than what you paid for it otherwise you'll have to pay out of pocket for those transaction costs now of course if you bought your home throughout the last few years then most likely this is not going to be a problem and you're probably sitting on a lot of profit congratulations but the future of home appreciation is not guaranteed and even though things look good with low inventory and strong demand there is a chance that the market could soften that's why i don't recommend buying a home unless you have a good idea how long you're going to be living there for and have taken into account the transaction cost of buying and selling and fifth because of that you shouldn't be buying a home unless you plan to keep it at least five to seven years that's because the shorter you plan to keep your home for the riskier it becomes that you'll make money by owning it things like transaction costs insurance repairs and maintenance are non-recoupable costs that you will not get back so you'll need to expect the property values will continue to rise to offset that expense to make buying worth it like on a 400 000 home over three years you could very well expect to pay a four thousand dollar closing cost when buying seventy eight hundred dollars a year in property taxes insurance and repairs and a twenty thousand dollar expense when selling that's forty seven thousand four hundred dollars worth of overhead and that doesn't even include your mortgage interest which could push that number even further that's why generally the break-even point for most homeowners is probably going to be somewhere between five and seven years and in almost all situations the longer you keep your home for the more likely you are to end up making money it's also important to mention that these last two years have been a complete anomaly when it comes to the housing market and it would be impossible for prices to keep rising at the same trajectory it's just not going to happen so my recommendation is if you're looking to buy a home that you're only planning on keeping for a few years it's probably not a good idea unless you're specifically going in with the intention of renovating it and flipping it for a quick profit renting it out in the future or you can handle the risk that maybe in the short term you're not gonna break even right away and six you should not buy a home if you don't have at least three to six months of your home's expenses saved up in cash at all times just like financial experts recommend you keep a three to six month emergency fund i recommend a home emergency fund that covers three to six months of your mortgage payments property taxes maintenance and anything else just in case something inevitably breaks or there's an unexpected bill outside of your control it's really important to recognize that everything in a property has a lifespan where eventually it'll need to be repaired or replaced for example roofs usually last 15 to 25 years water heaters last 10 to 15 years ac units last 10 to 15 years garbage disposals last a few days and so on and once you begin to average all of this costs throughout the course of your home ownership you'll begin to realize it adds up very very quickly on top of that most people are not fully aware that the cost of materials labor and wait times have increased substantially throughout the last two years so it could be quite a shock when you see what a 2022 repair bill looks like when you've compared that with what it used to look like back in the olden days"", ""and it's already causing the cost of gas per gallon to go up 15 cents from the month before now the real bad news though is the price of rent a whole bunch of people a wave of people who may have bought a house are now forced to keep renting because of all the pressure on the market right now those renters don't have a lot of options and they do have more tensions with their landlords many say the rent is too damn high and experts say it's in part due to the high cost of buying a home rent is becoming a huge problem for a couple reasons the latest data from Redfin shows even though the median home sale price is down 2.1 percent this year in comparison to last year housing payments are actually up in insanely High almost 15 percent combine all of that with the still low inventory levels and the tighter lending standards and that just means that people need higher credit scores higher down payments and higher incomes and that means people are forced to go back to renting only to then find out that rent is becoming that much more expensive nationally rent is more than 20 percent higher than the start of 2020 according to Redfin over 8 million Americans are behind on rent and 2.3 million experienced a rent increase of more than 500 in the last 12 months according to U.S census data released late last month the typical application fee is now anywhere from twenty to a hundred dollars just to apply for rent according to Redfin now it's not all that data here's one major reason why real estate is becoming more unaffordable that's a lot less talked about private Equity firms private Equity firms raise money from institutional and accredited investors so not just from any ordinary person those funds are then invested in different types of assets with the aim of getting a return on investment according to Americans for financial reform 1.6 million families rented from Real Estate owned by private Equity firms that includes over one million apartment units over 275 000 home lots and nearly two hundred and forty thousand single-family rental homes so there's no doubt that people are forced to compete with private equity in some markets and that's not helping homes become affordable but besides residential real estate there's also a massive problem with commercial real estate FDIC insured Bank hold the largest share of cre mortgages at 39 or 1.7 trillion dollars thirteen percent is held in cmbs and most is held at Regional and Community Banks now this year and next there is a huge pipeline of commercial mortgages hitting maturity that need to be refinanced refinancing those spaces will be really hard because interest rates have doubled over the last two years which will make those loans so much more expensive now I've talked about this problem in my last video but the problem is getting worse small Banks were actually the largest holders of retail spaces at 46 percent and 30 percent of office spaces property owners who need to refi are up against higher borrowing costs and lower property values Mark Grant Chief Global strategist at Collier security says everybody's scaling back their risk appetite for real estate loans office owners in particular are getting squeezed 40 billion dollars worth of these properties are now seen in distress but now those smaller banks are under pressure thanks to the banking crisis and the vacancies are going up and that's mostly happening because after the pandemic people chose to do hybrid work or work from home and now there's less of a need for businesses to own those commercial buildings in the first place and that's why the amount of office space for lease has been going up and it's estimated that by the end of the decade the majority of office spaces will be vacant prices are estimated to Fall by as much as 40 percent in commercial real estate if things continue the way they are right now now because Banks understand everything I just shared with you in this video Banks tend to become protective and defensive in this type of an economy and that's why the next big worry is something called a credit crunch events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses which would in turn affect economic outcomes a credit crunch happens when Banks stop lending as much money as they used to and this makes it harder for people to get a loan to buy a home and it makes it harder for businesses to operate and pay their employees and this is happening today small business bankruptcies are on the rise and we're seeing more today than we did at the height of the pandemic and the unique data that we have from UBS evidence lab suggests that these filings are up to a rate of about eight per week I think that the underlying message is that there is weakness in the SME sector the SME sector by the way refers to small and mid-sized Enterprises and it's companies that usually have less than 500 employees and make less than 100 million dollars in annual gross sales per year now these types of businesses according to the World Bank organization make up over 90 percent of the economy and over 50 percent of the workforce around the world now for the US in 2020 these companies made up 99 of the US economy and 47.1 percent of the U.S Workforce these types of companies are the lifeblood of the economy and a credit crunch would severely hurt them because they also have what's called floating rate debt which means any time they have to refinance their loans if interest rates are higher that puts a huge amount of pressure on them and it makes it that much more expensive and because people have pulled their money out of the smaller Regional banks that also means those banks have less liquidity to then lend that money out this makes those Banks more conservative and more defensive which leads to even less lending which eventually slows economic growth which translates to higher unemployment and we're already starting to see that happen outside of just the tech sector now of course this is a crisis that we should take seriously but it's also something that may never happen and this is because the government could step in and allow those companies to make interest-only payments on their loans and believe it or not this is already a thing in residential real estate you can apply for a mortgage interest only payment and your monthly payments for your house are going to be a lot lower but the trade-off is you're never gonna own the house some people call that renting but the banks call it you'll own nothing and be happy now since I'm an optimist I tend to believe that Banks don't want to repossess the commercial property because they don't want the liability they don't want to lose the money and the government doesn't want small businesses to go into a depression so more than likely the FED will have to step in and do something about all this and that brings us to interest rates now no one knows exactly what will happen to those interest rates because we don't live inside the mind of Jerome Powell but the stock market makes its own prediction every single day on what it thinks will happen on May 3rd that's the next time we'll hear about what happens to interest rates now there's actually two ways you can check yourself right now on what might happen and the first is my favorite method and it's called the CME fed watch tool the way to read this chart is to look at the current Target rate which is 4.75 to 5 now on the left you'll see a probability right now it shows 34.1 percent that the target rate on stay the exact same as it is right now on the right though it shows us a 65.9 percent chance that the FED will raise the target rate to between 5 and 5.25 percent which is a difference of a quarter percent from the current rate so that's the tool I use to tell you that come May 3rd most likely the Federal Reserve will increase the interest rates by 0.25 percent and hopefully that'll be the ceiling but we'll see that's all the short-term way to tell now the long-term way to tell is a little less reliable"", ""but that's not the case with commercial real estate instead you'll usually have a 20 to 25 year amortization schedule where a portion of your monthly payment goes towards the loan but there might be a balloon payment due at year seven which means if values decline you might owe more on the building than what the building is actually worth and third as you you probably noticed interest rates have gone up substantially in the last year which means there is a mountain of real estate that's about to be reset at current interest rates and that in turn could lead to an outright property disaster for example CPC reports that 25 percent of all office building loans are coming due in the next year and with rates now five times higher than they were a year ago ownership costs are going to be going up substantially and if you thought that was the end of it it's really just the very beginning now I understand that this might be a little bit too detailed but stick with me because you're about to learn a lot if you're not already familiar with how this works commercial real estate is valued on three main factors one is the land and future development potential of a project two is the price per square foot that it would cost to recreate the exact same building today and three which is the most important is how much money that building is able to make for instance if you pay a million dollars for a building that makes a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a ten percent return if it makes fifty thousand dollars a year that's a five percent return and so on because of that when it comes to these types of Investments Property Owners will always try to maximize the rent because its value is almost entirely dictated by item three the yield and the more money a property makes the more it's worth but today those properties are declining from a lack of rent and they're facing some stiff competition in the form of treasuries see at the core investors are all about the numbers they just think to themselves how could I make the most amount of money for the least amount of risk and work well when interest rates were at record lows and property was earning four and a half percent real estate was looking pretty good because it was actually paying something that was better than nothing but now treasuries are paying about five percent even the most basic of savings accounts are paying four and a half percent most mortgages are above seven percent and that's making real estate look a lot less appealing because why would you buy a negative cash flowing property at five percent when you could get that risk-free guaranteed with a treasury with no work whatsoever this suggests that in order for Real Estate to remain competitive it has to offer a return that's higher than that that you could already get risk-free which is a really fancy way of saying that real estate returns have to go up combine that with the fact that some buildings are now seeing a lower rent at the same time that interest rates are about to be reset higher while office space season 18.2 percent vacancy rate and you've got The Perfect Storm for a commercial real estate crisis so is this something to worry about well let's start with Wall Street because according to Fortune they're running away from the housing market and a prime example would be Blackstone they operate a real estate investment trust where investors could pull their money together to buy a wide variety of assets from residential housing to Industrial office space to Data Centers to hospitality the benefit is that this fund could operate someone like a Reit except by limiting their exposure to high net worth individuals they don't have to be publicly traded and up until recently this fund did exceptionally well but like I was alluding to earlier there's a bit of a problem since funds like these are primarily invested in highly liquid Real Estate Investors are somewhat limited if they want to get their money back after all if your money is all tied up in real estate you can't just snap your fingers and give it back to investors when they want it so as a condition to the service they limit investor withdrawals if too many people want to get their money out at the same time and wouldn't you know it Blackstone is limited investor withdrawals for the sixth straight month in a row why you might ask well imagine it kind of like you bought a million dollar house with a thousand other people if five of those people want their money back that's not a problem because you probably have that sitting in reserves but if 400 people all want their money back at the same time you can't do it without selling the house so either place a restriction on who could take their money out or you have to wait until the house is eventually sold in this case though Barons reported that investors requested four and a half billion dollars from the fund at the exact same time this is also shared by Wall Street sentiment towards housing as well for instance Invitation Homes which is the largest owner of single family renters has scaled back their purchasing because they believe that no longer makes Financial sense especially when they expect the market to continue falling like office space in San Francisco which could see an 80 crash although before we go into the consequences for everyday investors we should first cover realtor.com's latest housing report because there is a lot of new information here that will have a direct impact in you and your wallet in terms of what's happening today they found that there are 48 more active listings available on the market than there were a year ago and even though that sounds like a lot it's still just a fraction of what was available prior to the pandemic on top of that they also found that no region saw an improvement in sellers listing homes for sale in April which means across the entire country there's less interest in people listing their home for sale probably because they don't want to give up their existing mortgage rate it's also quite interesting that the typical home spent 49 days on the market this April which is 17 days longer than the same time last year however homes still spent 12 fewer days on the market this April than they did in the average April from 2017 to 19 and this is precisely why the housing market is not seeing a huge crash like so many people predicted now in terms of which location saw the biggest price increases and drops research from Black Knight found that Columbus Ohio Hartford Connecticut and Worchester Massachusetts saw the largest increases well the sharpest one-month declines could be found in markets like Austin Texas and Provo Utah beyond that though if we look at this from the peak the largest price declines so far have included areas like Austin San Jose San Francisco Seattle Phoenix Las Vegas Boise Stockton Sacramento and Salt Lake City so in terms of what this means for you and what you could potentially do about this to make money here are my thoughts first of all when it comes to funds like Blackstone unfortunately this is just the risk when it comes to all things real estate frankly if you want to buy property it should almost always be viewed as a 5 to 10 year hold at the very least because selling could often take a lot of time and profit is not guaranteed depending on the timing of the market even if you buy a property yourself selling a property often entails weeks to months of listing waiting for a buyer paying a commission at closing and that's something that has to be considered before you actually go and make the purchase separate from that I also think that if Blackstone is facing these issues it's probably a sign that wealthier people expect real estate to either deliver subpar returns or prices will begin to come back down and that's probably why they want to take their money out and be able to redeploy it elsewhere where maybe there's more potential the good news is that not all real estate's at risk and there are quite a few types of buildings that are actually doing quite well like Bloomberg reported that vacancy rates for warehouse and Industrial spaces low retail vacancy is only 5.7 percent and hotels are garnering record Revenue in addition to that about three-fourths of commercial real estate debt generates enough income to pass bank's research or financing standards without any major changes and delinquency rates are still below what they were prior to the pandemic no office space though on the other hand could be the exception because JP Morgan warns that 21 of office loans are destined to go bad with lender is losing an average of 41 percent of the loan principle on the failures because of that banks are expected to scale back on their lending be way more cautious about who they extend money to and that's likely going to affect you or anyone else who wants to borrow some of the bank's money that's why I think if you're looking to invest in real estate right now take your time be aggressive with offers and think long term about whether or not a property really makes sense to buy now I personally believe that long-term real estate still can be a great opportunity but short term banks will make it a lot more difficult to get a loan and that's something worth considering unless of course you have a low credit score just

random trades if that's the situation you're in then don't place random trades anymore do these three steps if you do these three steps the likelihood of you making money from trading goes up dramatically create a strategy or a trading plan back test it to make sure it's profitable on the currency pair you plan to trade it on and on the time frame do at least 100 tests each currency pair each time frame you plan to trade of the exact rules of your strategy if it proves to be profitable create a risk management plan based on the maximum number of losses and the maximum drawdown that you have with that strategy and after these three steps are complete again your chances of becoming a profitable trader skyrocket to the moon versus someone who's just out here trading based on fomo emotion moving stop losses switching strategies if those are the things you're dealing with this is how you fix them this three-step process i just taught you throughout this video all about trading psychology now that we've done that though that's the trading psychology portion of the video let me teach you a little bit about the strategy itself that i use here on the pound aussie and the mindset the reasoning behind actually placing the trade the technical aspect but just so you know as i said in the beginning trading psychology and discipline are going to be the most important parts of your trading you can learn a strategy literally today you can back test it within a week or two you can create a risk management plan in a day so you're you're two weeks away from creating a profitable trading career if you can get a handle on trading psychology learn a strategy back test it create a risk management plan trade demo for a couple months to make sure you can actually implement that strategy and you're well on your way to profitable trading if all that's done correctly but now let's take a look at the screen and talk about my mindset behind the trade you see on the pound aussie"", ""and that doesn't mean I'm at trading that's just the reality of what we do nobody really knows what the markets going to do which direction it's going to go but what we can do and what gives us an advantage is creating a rules-based strategy that gives us an edge over the market creating a set of rules that gives us let's say a 60 to 70 percent chance of winning at rate or that gives us a 50 percent chance with a two-to-one risk reward if we create a set of rules that give us those kind of odds every time we place a trade then that's the path to success the path to success is doing that not knowing which direction the markets going to go all the time so that was a brief video guys own rules based trading I really hope that it was helpful for your trading I was actually gonna break down the pound dollar a little bit further with you guys but we've already pointed out two of the main trading possibilities here on this pair for trading continuation traders if you have this in your trading plan then right now where the market is previous structure resistance is going to be a good place for you to look for possible long opportunities again if that's in your trading plan and if you're a counter trend trader we have just had this double top push down break of the neckline maybe your trading plan says to wait for a pullback into that neckline before you go short or possibly you're already short from here either way just making sure you're following your rules this has been Steven you're honest trading coach giving you a nugget of knowledge that I've learned in my trading career I hope it's beneficial and helpful to you if you're a beginner or more advanced in your trading career and you would like to invest in your trading education then we have much more advanced training that goes over strategies rules-based trading risk management discipline and everything you need in order to go from where you are and help you own your path to becoming profitable as a trader all of that can be found on the trading channel net and there's also a link in the description to our flagship program which is the EAP training program and of course I don't want you to have to take my word for that program being good I'm a bit bias but take a look at some of the testimonials we've had from other traders that have been through the program already and if you're ready to take the next step towards trading success then just click the link in the description labeled EAP training program if you're new here to the trading channel again make sure you're subscribed here click the notification bell to make sure you're alerted whenever we come out with new educational content just like this each and every week I'm there's been some wind noise in this video the audio could be a little bit messed up because of that my desk is actually right beside a window and we're having some pretty bad storms in the area that I live right now so sorry about that if that interrupted do you think throughout the video I try to edit as much as I can out of this video but as I said there's some pretty bad storms going on right now in my area and my desk is right beside a window so sorry about that"", ""but we can give ourselves the best likelihood of making money by trading something that's made money in historic data so if you have that cst set up then after you have that csd you should be able to go through historic data on a chart and do something called back test throughout this back test what you want to do is look at at least the previous 100 times that the exact rules you have made up through the process of cest happened on a single currency pair and time frame so every currency pair and time frame you would like to test test it 100 times on that pair and on that time frame for instance if i had cest a full strategy made up with cest on the euro dollar and i wanted to see if it was profitable on the daily 4 hour 1 hour and 15 minute chart i would test that exact strategy 100 times on the daily euro dollar on the four hour euro dollar 100 times on the one hour euro dollar 100 times and on the 15 minute euro dollar 100 times so it's always going to be at least for me and my personal confidence level i need to see 100 instances of that strategy playing out that rules-based objective strategy playing out and giving me a profit before i can add that pair to my portfolio because what the reason we're doing this is because with any given strategy it's going to work better on some pairs than others because different currency pairs have different personalities so the reason we do all this back testing not only does it build up confidence and help us with discipline not only does it give us an idea of what may be a good risk management plan for a strategy like this because we can tell out of historic data how many losses in a row did it have how many how much of a maximum drawdown did it have not even just losses in a row how many wins it have in a row you just gather so much information so you get confidence you get a ton of information it's almost like if you're starting a business then you're going to do product research before you start mass producing a product any big business has done this the product research part is then testing that product on a small sample size for us we're testing our strategy on a 100 time sample size to do our product research in order to see if it's something that may work in the future and that's what we're doing while we're back testing so as long as we have that done then the strategy portion of this is over you if you are currently feeling like you have a strategy problem then that is how you fix it if you're currently having a strategy problem where you are confused when you try to place a trade where you are constantly switching strategies any of the things that we listed that were going to be strategy problems if you feel like your problem is with a strategy then create a strategy or learn one that has solid and easy to follow conditions entries stops and targets then take that rules-based strategy write every one of those rules down write down all of your conditions all your entry reasons whether you have one or multiple write down your stop placement and your target payment placement based on all that information go through historic data 100 times per pair in time frame you want to test that on pick out the best pairs that worked and then your strategy problem will be completely solved you'll be good to go in terms of strategy now what was the next problem the next the second thing that if a trader has it it's impossible for them to be profitable it's impossible for them to make money as a trader the second thing is risk management now you hear a number floating around all the time that never risk more than two percent per trade but the thing is that's not correct or incorrect i'm not saying it's wrong i'm not saying it's right because it can't be either of those things considering that risk management is such a personal decision my risk tolerance for instance i may be a super risk averse person meaning that i don't like risk that much and risking two percent of my total account value every time i place a trade may be terrible for me emotionally in psychology psychologically almost skipped over that word uh it may be terrible for my emotions to risk a full two percent per trade""]"

bitcoin ethereum and a few other coins and just want to keep them in cold storage the nano s will make do just fine if you want to save a few bucks if you've never used a hardware wallet before there's a few things you need to know before getting started this is not like an account for a bank or a centralized exchange where you have an email address or username and a password that you create with ledger you are given a 24 word passphrase that you need to write down and keep in a safe place because this is your one and only key to your crypto you should not store this passphrase on a device that has access to the internet most security experts recommend you write it down on paper and store it somewhere that it won't be stolen or damaged one extremely important thing to remember is that you will only need to use the seat phrase in case of some kind of emergency like if your ledger is lost or somehow broken and needs to be restored you will never have to enter your seed phrase to gain access to any website or application there are a ton of scammers out there coming up with creative ways to get you to hand over your seed phrase don't do it the idea of storing your own seed phrase might seem intimidating at first but that's the whole point of crypto it's fine to start off with custodial services to get your feet wet but eventually it's time to graduate to holding your own keys even the most trusted and regulated exchanges still have outages and sometimes they can make life difficult with random rule changes and withdrawal limits that control how you use your money nobody wants to be told how to use their own money after you get your device set up and install ledger live you'll have access to a variety of new features that will allow you to transfer stake or trade crypto assets from the safety of your hardware wallet from ledger live you can install separate apps for each individual asset that you need onto your device you'll be able to access many of these assets directly through the ledger live app while others will require you to download an additional wallet on your desktop computer for projects like cardano or vchain you actually will need to download one of their wallets in addition to ledger live but you will be accessing these wallets with the same key just always make sure that you are downloading a wallet that's listed on the official ledger website so you don't get a fake or a fraud because they're out there if you're entirely new to crypto and need to get your portfolio started ledger live also has a fiat on ramp thanks to partnerships with coinify changely wire and more"", ""A crypto investment fund he presented these two infographics for us this one is how we used to think Hardware wallets like ledgers worked this one is how they actually work now the secure element chip is like a small computer that also holds Ledger's operating system this means that Ledger's firmware upgrades can affect the way things function inside the secure element so it can be programmed to send back anything that's requested now this is actually required in order for the device to upgrade and support newer chains whenever there's a new app being installed on the device it will in principle be able to extract private key data that's because in order to support these new chains they'll need to create a new key that's derived from the master key on the device now I'll also leave a link to the thread by Ledger's CTO in the description for you as it goes into the mechanics in much more detail as he makes clear in that thread using a hardware Wallet requires a quote minimal amount of trust this means that every time you've had to approve an upgrade on a ledger device you've had to have trust and as we all know trust is a dirty word in crypto it goes against the ethos on which trustless blockchains are built moreover as I mentioned earlier it's not about trust in Ledger per se but trusting that they won't have to comply with any sort of government requests now Ledger's co-founder and ex-ceo created a Reddit post where he addressed the debacle and said that technically governments could recover the shards and quote get access to your funds I will caveat though that this was in the context of the recover shards and not the issuance of poisoned updates but surely the principle should be the same in a recent podcast the current CEO also waved that subpoena concern Away by saying that it's quote not that common however he was reminded that coinbase was recently subpoenaed for something as simple as customer data I'll leave a link to that podcast in the description for you folks now one of the reasons for this miscommunication and subsequent PR disaster is that Ledger's code is closed Source users were never able to peer into the repositories and see how the secure element worked hence the reason that this all came as a shock so the result is that many are now calling for the code to be open sourced indeed I think that this is one of the only ways in which users can fully verify the security of the device as they say don't trust verify and this is also one of the reasons as to why I have always preferred Treasures over ledgers tresor's code is open source and hence there's no room for confusion as to how the devices operate moreover they have the option to generate more than one seed phrase through their Shamir backup now I've talked about this in much more detail in my Tresor video but it basically allows contingencies for seed loss without having to hand over seed phrases to the manufacturer or third-party custodians that said open source is no Silver Bullet by opening your code to the world you're also opening it up to all those who may want to exploit it moreover most treasure users don't read the code that's being pushed before choosing to upgrade I can't read firmware code myself and I am going to have to hope that the white hat hackers out there are better at auditing it than the black hats are so there is still an element of trust needed in third parties I'll also add that Tresor devices are vulnerable to what are termed high voltage glitching attacks now I won't go into the specifics of those here but I will link to a handy video by Kraken security Labs that discovered the exploit the caveat here though is that such an attack requires physical access to the device as well as the tools and Technical know-how to execute it and if you're looking for any other wallet Alternatives then you could consider a fully air-gapped kind these are

however let's look at some things that aren't scarce how about like sugar okay sugar used to be very scarce not scarce anymore there's a ton of sugar and it's basically like a penny for a pound it's no value to it well fiat currencies mean the fed itself has said they have infinite money that means there's no scarcity in it whatsoever that means there's no value in it bitcoin however 21 million bitcoin 6 million have already been lost that means there's 15 million bitcoin there's over 30 million millionaires in the world so even if every millionaire wanted to own a bitcoin and look at how popular they're becoming with institutions every millionaire couldn't every millionaire could only own half of the bitcoin you know if every person on the earth if bitcoin the 21 million bitcoin were divided upon every person on earth everybody would only get point zero zero two bitcoin so scarcest asset asset ever that's why you need to take a look at all coins compared to bitcoin because here's the thing bitcoin is going up check the scoreboard it just goes up and up and up and the problem is the human brain can't understand the exponential function in case you guys haven't yet make sure to like subscribe also click the notification bell but the brain can't understand the exponential function warren buffett and einstein have both said that the best thing ever created is compound interest well basically the inverse of compound interest is the exponential function and bitcoin every time there's a halfing it follows along the exponential function that's why we have the stock to flow model that's why we have the bitcoin rainbow chart every halfing the value of bitcoin goes up a whole another order of magnitude it was ten thousand last time it's a hundred thousand this time it'll be a millionth time after that 10 million after that now this isn't completely because of scarcity it's also because they're printing a ton of money this past year the us printed more money than has been created in a quarter of the existence of the united states so they printed 25 of the money that's ever been created in one year and they have another plan to do another two trillion dollar stimulus package coming up soon so fiat money is has no value take a look at zimbabwe take a look at venezuela take a look at germany back whenever they had their huge inflationary thing fiat money goes to zero bitcoin does not go to zero now the errors that you're making in investing you have to make them i made them other people made them everybody who's ever made money in cryptocurrency has made these investments because they're a next shiny thing like you see dogecoin go up 85 x and you're like"", ""but we have dumb money leading the bearish charge for Bitcoin turns out whenever dumb money confidence is high well these correlate with local tops this time is not different as dumb money confidence was high and the price comes down for SPX but for Bitcoin the time to accumulate is ticking away Bitcoin accumulation free Phase is nearing the end according to the Williams percent R I hope you were scooping up while it was possible you can see down here the Williams percent R when it's below this red line right here these are ideal accumulation periods we are just about leaving that territory right now so suggesting the time is running out and we're going to take a look at exactly why it could be happening sooner than anyone expects right now good things come in threes for Bitcoin Bitcoin on way to a monthly Bollinger band basis at around Thirty one thousand dollars is getting closer once regained expect some fireworks so you can see this red line on the Bollinger Bands when Bitcoin crosses it to the upside generally parabolic rally ensues afterwards we're getting pretty darn close Thirty one thousand dollars right now should we cross that that could be fireworks for Bitcoin we do have a true bottom forming on the hikish hiki hikingashi candles uh when it turns the first set of green candles during a bear Market that's a fake signal you can see the first greens here fake signals second greens true bottom historically for all those True Believers out there it looks like we may have the true Bottom already and that time is right now like we talked about time is running out to accumulate Bitcoin these signals obv is something that generally is a leading indicator for Bitcoin so this is a good one to keep an eye out for and the Chan momentum oscillator also gives us a good idea as to what's happening so number one we have the obv starting to tick back up same time we have a breakthrough of the Chan momentum oscillator breaking a previous downtrend now historically when both of these things have happened this has been the beginning of massive runs for Bitcoin so this time everything is lining up once again where we may see massive Bitcoin runs and this month is critical only a few hours left until the monthly closed so possibly by the time this episode airs it will have closed but a monthly close above the 10ma line has confirmed the start of a new bull market for Bitcoin in 2015 right here and 2019 right here I hope you know how important this is right now the candle is above that 10 m a on the monthly if we close above there that could be very very big for Bitcoin which brings us to the Chart the route to the halfing these are the cycles aligned by April 2021 all-time highs you can see we are right in the territory where the bottom is usually already in and just generally a slow uptick until after the halfing until the price really starts to go up so you know barring any unforeseen Mega craziness that you know could happen who knows what's going to happen in the world these days otherwise things are looking pretty good for Bitcoin"", ""so those are important levels to keep an eye out for for Bitcoin but as we speak Bitcoin is basically fighting for price between about twenty thousand dollars and twenty three two night right now though across the markets we're seeing levels of panic that have only been seen five other times since 1994 30 years has only seen this type of panic five other times and guess what every other time it was basically when the markets were at a low before a massive rally and soon you know what could cause that rally well the one thing that's been crashing the markets dxy going up all of a sudden breaking down to unheard of levels breaking down below covid-19 resistance levels support levels also breaking down below this macro uptrend line this could cause USD to drop significantly and just take a look at this chart what happens when usdt drops bitcoin price goes up so those are very very important things to consider now as for the moment the coin values days destroyed has been support for Bitcoin defended for two months straight the first proper test across from covid-19 in the 2019 lows also seen at the 2015 lows this could suggest that the bottom has been in solid accumulation for months at 16 000 as a matter of fact we're seeing the super Trend Buy Signal on the five day flashing a Buy Signal for the first time in over a year the last time this happened bitcoin price went up 239 percent that's like 2.4 x from where the price is just flashed a Buy Signal as a matter of fact if we take a look at this looking at the RSI cups when we had breakouts from these cups this basically began a new cycle for Bitcoin we had the teal and then the blue and then the purple and then the red and now we're on to the orange cup which could lead Bitcoin to some pretty spectacular territory as we have at a breakout from that RSI just recently but you know what happens before the big Bitcoin event the halfing that everybody talks about the Litecoin having it turns out Bitcoin Litecoin approaching the halfing in previous Cycles Litecoin led the Market's new uptrend this is due to Litecoin have things occurring less than one year before the Bitcoin having usually spells the end of the bear Market let's see what happens July 2023 by this summer Litecoin hacking will happen you can see Litecoin price takes up first then Bitcoin follows Litecoin first Bitcoin follows we see Litecoin ticking up first potentially Bitcoin soon to follow we have had a characteristic breakout with each previous Bitcoin Bull Run each time Bitcoin had a green candle which broke through the 81.6 FIB each time this occurred this was pretty much the definitive move before massive rallies that ensued for Bitcoin we just had this green candle break through the 81.6 FIB which was at twenty thousand three hundred dollars almost the same we could potentially see the same exact thing happening for Bitcoin if that doesn't convince you how about on a monthly time frame I love longer time frame charts because you can't fake them out they give you a lot more information than the short little daily or four hour charts but this Bitcoin monthly green candles and RSA oscillator trigger bull run the fourth time in history each time we've had a green candle here in the RSI oscillator which we can see when this basically flips down here well that has begun the beginning of each major Bull Run for Bitcoin we're having it happen right now this is the first monthly candle this is like getting in at the ground floor""]"

really really hard there's a lot of negative impacts with that lots of negative side effects if I don't work at all or if I work when I call not working at all which is like a normal schedule then guess what that's also very very bad because then you have all this extra time where you're just kind of feeling pointless so I thought about this a lot and I came up with the Perfect Analogy that explains what's going on here imagine you are a ship sailing out in Rough Waters on a long long Voyage to a beautiful destination that you really want to get to you may need to dock many ports along the way for repairs and maintenance especially if the weather conditions were bad and trust me they'll be bad but you see that necessary docking period it's only for a short period of time after you dock and after you get those repairs and maintenance it's time to get back out on the water sitting at the dock forever wastes the ship and destroys its purpose we are ships meant to be sailed we can choose to go out on the Seas or sit at the dock rotting away slowly both are very very painful but one one gets you to the destination or at least get you farther to the destination but it is our job to do the best we can and I realized that when I'm dead I don't want people to look back on my life and be like yeah that Charlie guy he kept anxiety out of his life he was very very balanced but you know he didn't do much with his life he never really accomplished much he never pushed the envelope or did anything worth having anxiety for or being out of balance four he'll be forgotten soon and who cares there is plenty of more memorable people out there in fact the Charlie from Charlie bit my finger will always be the more impactful Charlie at least he had the balls to bite that finger folks I want people to say that that Charlie guy he was a massive earthquake and he built something Brick by Brick that inspires tons and tons and tons of people I want people to say rain or shine that Charlie guy showed up in full force it didn't matter if there was a hurricane outside he was there working he was there trying to make an impact he was there trying to do something that could Inspire the next generation of people so with that in mind I am ushering in a new era of zip Trader and I invite you on board to set sail with us we are ready to leave the docks and get over to the

though just don't even ask me what my middle name is so as a father of a two-year-old I glanced at Billy size up the competition he was licking the display window in front of the pastries so with all due respect to the mom my money is on her perhaps being just a little bit biased and the investing world mini US investors commentators financial media think that the u.s. is gifted by this I mean they to believe that our stock market is the healthiest and most robust therefore it warrants a higher valuation than that of other stock markets around the globe is that true are we special or does US market lick the display glass just like everyone else I'll post this chart to the show notes but as you can see is that right as I discussed this the US trades at a long-term cape ratio of around 30 that level is fairly high from a historical perspective for further context to keep average from countries around the globe is around 16 right now that makes us level almost double the average country is that normal many pundits will list the myriad reasons why the US deserves this lofty valuation the rule of law gap earnings stable government haha but take a quick look at history will cast doubt on the explanations first if the US is truly special it should always be special right meaning if the US market is so fantastic that a higher valuation has always warranted than historically it should always have a higher valuation but that's not what history tells us if you look at a chart showing the US Cape versus the rest of the world X u.s. this is just foreign stocks going back to 1980 which is we don't have a whole lot of great valuation data before that both have an average Cape ratio of about 22 let me repeat that the historical valuation premium has been zero beyond that the amount of time each spends being more expensive than the other is basically a coin flip sometimes US stocks are more expensive sometime foreign stocks are more expensive that stat surprises a lot of people who assume that the u.s. being currently expensive always trades at a premium and for some reason deserves to after all the US is special if you look at this chart will post to the show notes you can see that foreign stocks were more expensive during most of the 80s and there's a reason for that whereas the US has been more expensive during the internet bubble and again post financial crisis the reason that foreign stocks traded so much more expensive in the 80s had a lot to do with Japan hit the biggest bubble we've ever seen again not some backwater economy still one of the largest economies in the world stock market in the world in the 80s hit a caper ratio of almost a hundred in the 80s and dragged foreign stocks to be quite a bit more expensive than the US which was cheap during most the 80s how many of y'all were buying stocks hand over foot when stocks were trading in the early eighties and single-digit kabe ratios generational buying opportunity today however marks one of the widest valuation spreads in history with foreign markets trading in a much cheaper levels than that of the u.s. there was one other time when we had a massive valuation spread but it was the opposite foreign stocks were much more expensive in the 80s but in this case the u.s. is the spread only intensifies if we zero in on the cheapest quartile of countries around the globe so there's about 45 investable countries around the world"", ""then a competitor of Qualcomm which is broadcom stock ticker avgo a stock that I hold within my dividend portfolio is up 45 year-to-date but Qualcomm has been left behind why is that number one the recovery in China has been a lot slower than many had expected at the end of last year China reopened completely taking away their covet zero restrictions but many companies baked in a lot of growth expectations with the reopening of China that just hasn't come to fruition yet secondly handset sales are down across the globe down 17 percent for Qualcomm alone when the company reported their Q2 earnings they were actually in line from an EPS standpoint and they beat on sales but the company also gave pretty light guidance EPS came in at 2.15 sense which I mentioned was inline revenues for the quarter came in at 9.28 billion and analysts were expecting 9.1 billion there's the beat on revenues but in terms of guidance Q3 sales are expected to come in at 8.5 but the street was looking for 9.14 billion and EPS guidance also came in light at a dollar eighty when analysts were looking for 2.16 per share definitely some huge gaps there between analysts and management Qualcomm also had negative cash flow during the quarter as their cash position decreased by 1.3 billion however they remain cash flow positive on the year thus far in terms of free cash flow Qualcomm generated 3.7 billion in free cash flow through the first half of the year compared to paying out dividends of 1.7 billion which equates to a free cash flow yield of 46 percent which tells me the dividend is plenty safe at the moment speaking of the dividend Qualcomm pays an annual dividend that yields 2.9 percent and over the past five years investors have seen the company increase the dividend and an average of 5.2 percent per year so not a ton in terms of dividend growth although the last two hikes have been above the average rate which is positive now for valuation analysts are looking for FY 2024 adjusted EPS of 9.57 cents per share which equates to an earnings multiple of 12.1 times for comparative purposes over the past five years shares of Qualcomm have traded at an average earnings multiple of 17.1 times and over the past decade closer to 15.7 times the second dividend stock on our list today is Johnson and Johnson stock ticker J and J now many of you are already well aware of the company Johnson and Johnson but there has been some changes within the company over the past few months the company rolled off its consumer health segment into a completely new and separate public company called can view which trades under the stock ticker KVUE"", ""so if investors are constantly buying and selling shares on the secondary market how our stock price is determined well the price of a stock is largely governed by the basic economic principles of supply and demand plain and simple at any given time there's a maximum price someone is willing to pay for a certain stock and a minimum price someone is willing to sell shares of that stock for think of the stock market as an auction with some investors bidding for the stocks and other investors that are willing to sell if there's a lot of demand for stock investors will buy shares quicker than sellers want to get rid of them and the price will move higher to reflect that on the other hand if more investors are selling a stock and buying the market price will drop now you might be thinking to yourself what if people don't want to sell their shares how can you buy them in order to ensure that there's always a liquid marketplace for stocks on an exchange individuals known as market makers act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers market makers buy and hold shares and continually list quotes to buy and sell those shares the highest offer to buy shares listed from the market maker at any given time is known as the bid and the lowest offered selling price is known as the ask the difference between those two is called the spread the main reason for using market makers as a system as opposed to simply letting investors buy and sell shares directly between one another is to ensure that there's always a buyer to match with every seller and vice versa if you want to sell a stock you don't need to wait until a buyer wants your exact number of shares a market maker will buy them right away now if you want to buy a stock you'll have to do it through a broker basically someone that is licensed to trade stocks on an exchange a broker maybe an actual person who will tell you what to buy and sell but in today's day and age it's probably an online broker that processes each transaction electronically when you buy a stock here's a simplified version of how it works you tell your broker what stock you want to buy and how many shares you want your broker relays that order to the exchange and a market maker sells you the shares at the current market price then those shares are delivered to your account you've probably heard statements such as the market is up or the stock beat the market often when discussing the stock market people generalize the stock market to a stock index stock indices such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average are a representation of the performance of a large group of stocks but not the entire exchange and are often used as a benchmark to compare the performance of individual stocks to an entire portfolio for example the S&P 500 index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States indexes are a convenient way to discuss an approximation of what is happening in the stock market but they do not fully represent the entire stock market the beauty of a stock market index like the S&P 500 is that they aren't just a measure of how stocks are doing they can also be a way for folks that are new to investing to easily put their money to work thanks to Jack Bogle and Vanguard the average investor can buy a fund that tracks an index like the S&P 500 and pay a tiny fee to do so making it easy and cheap to start investing folks that are looking to get into the market for the first time we recommend doing exactly that look for an ETF or a mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500 and boom you are immediately a part owner in 500 of the

well likely Global recession once that happens markets will stop caring about inflation and hawkish central banks but Charlie the FED won't cut rates until inflation is at two percent while I strongly disagree with that the FED will cut rates the minute a massive recession causes unemployment to start skyrocketing does it matter if inflation is at three percent or four percent or even five percent they'll say this is the better of two evils we must cut cut in order to save jobs and help support the economy and that's what you are seeing the bond markets pricing as well right if you look at the percentage of fund managers surveyed expecting lower versus higher bond yields in 12 months they've hit a convergence point where as of right now slightly more managers think rates will be lower in 12 months versus higher in 12 months and the trend is pretty clearly upward so the majority of managers no longer trust the fed's narrative that they'll keep rates high for the next several years that's a big shift and if this trend upward continues you're going to start seeing that impact the market as well but what is the big money doing how are fund managers allocating their portfolios well in terms of positioning changes you have a lot of fund managers adding to positions and utilities which have pricing power in both Bull and Bear markets and pay big dividends add back into the Eurozone which is improving value-wise as compared to the immediate aftermath of the invasion and adding into emerging markets at a pretty big Pace as they expect them to bounce back with the weakening of the US dollar and reopened China pouring into Industrials pouring into discretion area which are companies like retailers hotels restaurants overall Leisure my guess is probably because they are discounted I would think that discretionary wouldn't be the top bet when entering a recession but they seem not to care I think they're trying to scoop up those dips and get some good diversification you have them going back into the UK Market insurance and Banks and then look at what they are reducing their positioning in Commodities and energy as they see down Trends in price Consumer Staples as Supply chains heal and there's less profitability and price gouging over the excess input cost bonds as they get destroyed with higher yields tech stocks as multiples continue to get crunched Health Care they are positioning out of probably taking profit because the healthcare segment was one of the best performers year over year one of the only segments size energy that was green almost across the board and then you have a reduction in equities and a massive massive reduction in positioning in the U.S market"", ""this could change everything for the markets next week the Federal Reserve is set to meet a bunch of men are going to decide what's happening with your money it's widely expected that the Federal Reserve will be slowing down the size of their interest rate hikes for months now the Federal Reserve has been making some very aggressive moves with rate hikes of 0.5 or 50 basis points per month currently those rates are sitting at 4.25 percent most people expect that the Federal Reserve only raised rates by 0.25 or 25 basis points next week bringing the rate up to 4.5 percent now this would indicate a significant shift overall in the aggressiveness of rate hike policies by the Federal Reserve and that the Federal Reserve is in their opinion on the right track to tackling inflation and that rates could even stop hiking pretty soon the FED has stated a target of 5.1 percent which could indicate two more 0.25 percent rate hikes in February in March than 0.1 rate hike in April meaning that if this 5.1 estimate holds true then April will be the last month of rate hikes assuming of course that inflation does continue to fall that becomes a pretty likely scenario all cars off the table of inflation spikes back up obviously the numbers for inflation for December showed that inflation is still indeed falling though down just 6.5 percent which is down from 7.1 percent in November and down from 9.1 percent in June now this would seem to indicate that the Federal Reserve is currently winning the war on inflation for now but the inflation Target of the FED two to three percent so we still have a long way to fall inflation wise to reach that so if we do hit a terminal interest rate like a 5.1 percent in April what does that mean for the markets"", ""[Music] the Federal Reserve System the Federal Reserve System or simply the Fed is the nation's central monetary authority or central bank the Fed Board of Governors are responsible for creating and implementing monetary policy many Americans are not even aware of the important role the Fed plays in our country the interest rates Americans pay on home loans car loans or whether they can even get a loan at all is strongly affected by the decisions and actions of the Fed in fact the Fed Chairman currently Ben Bernanke is often called the second most powerful person in America let's look at the organization of the Federal Reserve the Fed basically has three levels at the top level is the Board of Governors with this Chairman Ben Bernanke the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC and the Federal Advisory Council the middle level consists of 12 Federal Reserve Bank's located throughout the US and the bottom of third level consists of thousands of member banks located throughout the US and the non-bank public you me everybody else the Board of Governors consists of seven members who are appointed by the president for 14-year terms they are not eligible for reappointment the president also appoints one of the seven members as the chairman of the board for a term of four years the Chairman may be reappointed the Board of Governors is the central policymaking section of the Federal Reserve System they are responsible for creating and implementing monetary policy because the decisions made by the board of such a big impact on the economy it is important that the board is not influenced by partisan politics because of this the decisions made by the board do not have to be approved by Congress or by the president the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC is responsible for the buying and selling of government securities bills bonds notes in the open market to change interest rates and affect availability of credit the 12-member committee consists of the seven Board of Governors plus five presidents of the Federal Reserve banks the FOMC will be discussed more in a future video on interest rates and FOMC decisions the Federal Advisory Council the members of the Federal Advisory Council consists of twelve commercial bankers with one number being selected by each of the twelve Federal Reserve Bank's the Federal Advisory Council acts as a junction between bankers and the Board of Governors it meets with the Board of Governors to report on general business conditions throughout the nation and to give advice about future banking policies Federal Reserve Bank's the Federal Reserve Act which created the Federal Reserve System divided the country into twelve districts it also established a separate Federal Reserve Bank for each district this is much different than most countries most countries only have a single central bank the Federal Reserve Banks could be called bankers banks in that they deal only with other banks and other financial institutions they do not deal with the public each Federal Reserve Bank is owned by the commercial banks in its district who are members of the Fed they are required to buy stock in the Federal Reserve Bank when to become members of the Fed although the Federal Reserve Banks are privately owned the main goal is the carry out monetary policy is dictated by the Board of Governors commercial banks fall into two categories national banks and state banks national banks are chartered by the federal government and are required to become members of the Fed state banks are chartered by individual states and have the choice as to whether they join the Fed or not join the Fed however even if they do not join state banks must still abide by the rules of the Fed let's look at some of the functions the Fed performs one function the Fed performs is making sure that the member banks comply and conform to the banking laws and regulations the Fed provides paper currency or money the Fed is responsible for cheque clearing another function that performs is serving as fiscal agent for the federal government including holding tax money the Fed also holds the required reserves that banks and other financial institutions are required to keep and it sets the reserve limit requirements however the most important function of the Fed is controlling the amount of money in circulation which is part of monetary policy more in banking and monetary policy in the next video so that ends our discussion on the Federal Reserve System in the next video we'll discuss how banks create money and in the following video after that we will discuss monetary policy in detail see you then""]"

looking at and the things that are going on in this bear Market because despite this bear Market there's a ton of capital and a ton of interest and a ton of Development coming into one sector specifically and it's nfts nft gaming technology metaverses Etc that is going to be the boom that is the next sector to get out of this bear market and absolutely explode you see the things that polygon are doing you see the things that all these massive games are doing empowering their players their customers you know these big Brands getting involved and this is nothing short of what Vulcan Forge is doing themselves bringing in huge fashion brands bringing in major players major investors major product pushing a new blockchain so these are the type of things that we're going to break down right here on these what is Vulcan Forge you know what is Gala games type of video so you can look forward to these in the future whenever we do continue to discuss and break down each project here on in the game let me know your thoughts on pyr down below as I really think that Vulcan Forge is probably um one of the projects that is built the most in this bear market and that will come out of the other side of this bear Market uh even stronger than they have uh and you know when you're looking at an all-time high of about 44 dollars we're about 10x Plus off of all-time highs here for Vulcan Forge at an 80 million dollar market gap for everything that they're building hearing that they're building other projects metaverses as well I think that 86 million dollar market cap is pretty undervalued in my opinion but as mentioned this is never Financial advice and I'm just always letting you guys know what I'm seeing and what I'm looking at in these markets so if you liked this video let me know Down Below in the comments drop a subscription and we will be back tomorrow with another video here on in the game as always play well my friends"", ""so I I really think it's really sharpened up everyone's Minds to like okay uh you know you really have to dive into these and really find out who's behind these projects and who's pushing these products and who's actually going to adopt and use and actually what is this applicable for tokenomics ETC and that's what we're here to break down for you every single day because you know if you have all these tools in your belt that we're giving you on this channel then you're going to be able to actually take advantage of this bear market like I said and then Vulcan forged looking forward to a firm part of you know what we're looking at as far as probably my top tier gaming probably my top tier gaming accumulation out of this bear Market everything they've done with Anthony scaramucci skybridge Capital the Elysium blockchain the Met escapes platform it's just absolutely phenomenal This was meant to be on polygon uh on talking about polygon about how the number of nft wallets is really approaching it is approaching the ethereum chain as far as the number one spot on in terms of nft Wallets on different chains so that's good to see as well but when you look at Vulcan Forge the med escapes platform is looking brilliant now this is their metaverse as a service platform this is their meta versus a service platform we're looking at what Jamie Thompson and Anthony scaramucci have said in a recent interview is that you know Jamie's for the CEO of Vulcan Forge said that they've actually built some of the biggest metaverses for other products in other games and other tokens"", ""but I want to kind of put together an ongoing segment on the show where we're going to break down all of the top crypto gaming projects in one video so you have a One-Stop shop to be able to come in and actually

this to happen but really a lot of it's about the decline of the US dollar over time and of course really of all Fiat currencies is going to be a major driving factor in seeing that go price go up and one world leader in particular he has had enough of the US dollar and that is of course Vladimir Putin he's been doing his best to build the yellow brick road toward a new Reserve currency created by a group of country called brics earlier this year he announced that Brazil Russia India China and South Africa the brics group are working on a new basket-based Reserve currency there's also interest from other countries who are also wanting to de-dollarize countries like Egypt turkey Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia one of the big wild cards here all wanting to join the brics group the issue of creating an international Reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of their countries it's currently being worked out and gold is part of the plan Putin said it the brics business Forum that we are ready to openly work with all fair partners of five countries are also trying to create an alternative mechanism for international humans he added the case for why the brics countries would use gold it's pretty gosh darn simple more monetary Freedom they want to receive a solid currency that they can control or at least have a larger sayover in return for their goods and of course to avoid sanctions so they can transact freely without the Western countries dictating their moves the head of ing Chris Turner said safety liquidity in return make a great Reserve currency which is why bricks could potentially look toward adding gold into that basket if they're worried about the path of sanctions and the increasing weaponization of the dollar they like Russia might prefer to move into gold now this could definitely be a strong possibility here Russia of course is the third leading gold producer in the world so as of course no surprise that over the decades it has dramatically increased its gold reserves it's also tell telling that these countries are already dabbling into the world of crypto and of course of Central Bank digital currencies these countries went out of the U.S dollar system is it possible we could get a gold-backed stable coin in the future in the forms of a brics currency certainly interesting food for thought and of course that's all happening at the same time that Russia is about to allow Bitcoin for international payments so it's a very interesting coincidence if you will now the second reason that gold could boom in the same reason the Bitcoin can boom and those other store value assets right is because of increased demand from central banks around the world you see gold does well in recessions as we see investors turning to gold for its perceived safety it has produced positive gains in five out of the seven last recessions now as fears have been escalating over last year central banks have been preparing for the worst demand for gold has increased all over the world from central banks and particular we're seeing huge buying sprees according to the world gold Council demand for gold increased by 28 percent in 2022 central banks have been boosting their reserves big time with gold almost as if never before Q3 2022 saw a 55-year high demand for gold from central banks with them buying a record 399 tons worth of gold around 20 billion dollars worth that's almost double the previous record during the same period from back in 2018."", ""Klaus acknowledged that the wefts top-down approach failed which is why they're now focusing on young global leaders for a bottom-up approach speaking of which the fourth speaker was Jeremy Jurgens Chief business officer at the weft Jeremy explained that the speed of digitization will drive the kind of intimate public and private cooperation the weft is looking for note that private and public integration are common in authoritarian regimes Jeremy went on to explain that there will be another Global crisis that it will be worse and that it will happen fast he then revealed that the weft has been working closely with intelligence agencies on cyber security related to energy infrastructure and asked what would happen if the energy grid went down not very subtle speculation aside the fifth and sixth speakers were Sebastian Tolstoy head of Ericsson's Russian operations and Alexei Konya CEO of MTS Russia's largest Telecom company the pair talked about the rollout of 5G and how its purpose is primarily for the operation of smart cities not for civilian use the seventh and eighth speakers were Nick gowing a former BBC News journalist and Vladimir Posner a Russian journalist naturally the pair talked about if fake news is the real digital pandemic Nick began by slamming then U.S president Donald Trump for calling the mainstream media fake news Vladimir continued by questioning whether it's a good thing that people have more access to information in the modern day and said that journalists used to be soldiers under the Soviet Union funnily enough there was lots of disagreement with Vladimir saying he wasn't enjoying the conversation it seems Vladimir won the argument though because governments around the world are in the process of passing online censorship laws some of which will go into force in the next few months you can learn more about that using the link in the description anyways the ninth speaker was Stefan duguin CEO of The cyberpiece Institute and he didn't say anything worth noting heck the cyberpolygon website didn't even bother to provide a description for his slot I suppose that calling for peace doesn't quite jive with the weft's obsession with all kinds of wars it's a similar story for the 10th and 11th speakers Danya taka vice president of aema and Wendy Whitmore vice president of IBM X-Force threat intelligence as exciting as these titles sound the conversation itself was pretty boring tldr hackers are targeting infrastructure and everyone is at risk the 12th and 13th speakers were Jacqueline kerno who works in cyber security Consulting at Ernst young and Hector Rodriguez a senior vice president at Visa the topic of discussion was how to prepare for a cyber crisis and what the panelists said was eye-opening to say the least Jacqueline insisted that the next Global crisis is imminent and said that the only solution is government regulation thankfully Hector was not as convinced there will be another Global crisis but revealed that Visa already had a plan for dealing with the pandemic shortly before it began I'm sure it's a coincidence now the 14th and 15th speakers were trace erting the chairman of the wefts center for cyber security and Jurgen stock the Secretary General of Interpol for those unfamiliar Interpol fights International crime with the help of law enforcement agencies from 195 countries and Counting while the Interpol Charter states that the organization is supposed to be politically neutral in practice it appears to be very closely aligned with the weft this is because troyce revealed that he and Jurgen have been close friends for 30 years Jurgen also said that Interpol and the weft are aligned Jurgen is particularly passionate about the West's fourth Industrial Revolution which essentially involves the digitization of everything so that it can be closely monitored and controlled to that end Jurgen believes that software and Hardware should have security by design features that allow for this control the 16th speaker was Craig Jones who also works at Interpol specifically as the organization's cybercrime director Craig's answers weren't nearly as revealing as the questions from Alexander who asked about cyber attacks being executed in waves across multiple countries oddly specific I should note that Alexander asked the last few speakers if cybercrime groups collaborate better than countries do the answers were fairly mixed but the consensus seemed to be that cybercrime groups are collaborating better than countries are which makes sense given the tense political climate the 17th speaker was Peter gorodov head of international legal cooperation at Russia's General prosecutor's office Petter was watching the simulation at spare Bank headquarters and Alexander asked him why cybercrime was on the rise in Russia and why only eight percent of cybercrime cases are solved Peter dodged the question and called on the United Nations to create a new convention focused on cyber crime if I had my tinfoil hat"", ""but if the United States and its allies use deep fakes against these hostile countries then that's good to be clear I'm not on anyone's side here I honestly think all sides have equal levels of corruption regardless the authors acknowledge that deep fakes don't always work and even when they do they will be fairly easy for governments to discredit they also add that as public awareness of deep fakes increases then there will be a sort of Baseline skepticism of the information that's being shown online this obviously creates another problem which is that the average person may also become skeptical of official information as a result and this ties into the fourth part of the report which contains a long list of policy recommendations related to deep fakes the authors cover both defensive and offensive policies in terms of defensive policy the authors admit that creating deep fake detection Technologies won't work in the long run because deep fake developers will inevitably upgrade their Gans to avoid detection that leaves only one option and that's the authentication and verification of digital content this begs the question of what such authentication and verification would entail and the answer is probably kyc if you watched our video about online censorship you'll know that governments worldwide are introducing laws that will require you to complete kyc to use social media in the name of safety the authors also suggest making sure that any new information that comes out isn't immediately accepted as true until it's been verified by multiple third parties they seem to advocate for slowing down how quickly information is shared online so that the fact checkers can do this verification work in terms of offensive policy meanwhile the authors advise against using deep fakes for domestic propaganda purposes because quote a botched manipulation of one news story might discredit government efforts to address hundreds of other pieces of news to that I say look up operation Mockingbird while you're at it check out our video about social media censorship link will be in the description I digress now the authors also advise against using deep fakes for intelligence operations because they carry unspecified risks they then say this quote consider how the United States and other democracies have used public health programs as cover for their operatives that's not suspicious at all in all seriousness the authors are aware that democratic governments will nonetheless use deep fakes for both defensive and offensive purposes given this fact they suggest the United Nations set deep fake standards and that the U.S introduced the aforementioned deep fake equities process now the remainder of the report is a deep dive into how deep fakes work including classification algorithms and deep learning what's funny is they use a picture of one of the authors to illustrate how deep fakes classify information it's worth a read if you have the time and the brain capacity so this brings me to the big question and that's why the emergence of deep fakes could be used to justify unprecedented internet censorship and control well if the last few minutes didn't make it clear enough deep fakes will make it next to impossible to know what information is true or false online this sounds silly Until you realize that AI is growing at an exponential rate chat GPT is just the tip of the iceberg soon there will be dozens of advanced AIS each with their own biases and abilities it's only a matter of time before the average person has access to this powerful Tech too if you watched our video about chat GPT you'll know that one of the most powerful things it can do is write code I reckon it won't be long before people start using chat GPT style AIS to create Advanced gas that can produce deep fakes that are realer than the real thing when this happens the internet will become flooded with misinformation and disinformation and not just controversial facts that the people in power don't like we could see serious domestic and international conflicts arise which could destroy the world as we know it this is why I'm starting to become convinced that governments around the world will do something to slow down the development of both Ai and deep fakes in theory they could announce an emergency pause on their use and development but in practice that would be next to impossible to enforce alternatively governments could engage in the Cyber attack the elites keep talking about this would take everything offline and allow only verified users and content to reappear as exciting as such an option would be it would clearly come with its own implementation issues so this leaves only one other option and that's requiring All Digital content to be authenticated and verified as per the author's advice recall that this is code for forcing everyone to do an identity check if they want to post something online this would give the government total control of information online the worst part is that this approach wouldn't work to stop deep fakes either that's simply because governments would continue to post deep fakes from authorized accounts for domestic propaganda purposes this propaganda would likely be related to going to war or say fighting a pandemic to add insult to injury anyone who claims that the official information being given by governments online is fake would likely be banned if not outright sent to prison and if they tried to present evidence that the government was publishing fake information this evidence would be branded as a deep fake""]"

even though it's too early to tell how this is going to play out it's not the first time that AI has tried to overtake traditional investing and a recent one is called portfolio pilot with this users could copy and paste their portfolios into the tool for analysis receive investment recommendations search for Market information and ask the bot questions all for free of course if you're about to comment but Graham who on Earth would trust this thing well the answer is wealthy people in fact 77 percent of them reported that they've utilized it for stock picks or the way I see it they have the disposable income to try it out for all of our Amusement in addition to that you also have the investment AI magnify which uses computer programs to provide personalized data-driven investment advice while democratizing intelligence in a personalized way essentially the publisher on CNBC tried it out and found it to be an effective way of answering questions giving specific advice and recommending companies depending on what you ask it but the difficult part is I see it is whether or not these companies would be liable for giving personalized investment advice in the event that one of their recommendations ends up losing money after all when you usually ask chat gbt about investing it emphasizes that when you build a portfolio you should incorporate your investment objectives time frame and risk tolerance and for personalized investment advice to a specific individual this is really the correct answer the fact is every situation is different what works for me might not be best for you some people want to take a whole bunch of risk while other people don't want the chance of losing any money you also have to consider that for most people investing is rarely ever logical instead as hard as it might be to want to admit investing is largely based on emotion this is nicely why dead people often make the best investors they don't panic sell when their stock gets a low they don't fomo into something when everyone else is jumping in they simply buy something and stick with it long term until eventually they die and end up in a survey on top of that I could also see issues with chat gbt recommending stocks that do well because it recommended them and people blindly Buy in this reminds me of What's called the Jim Cramer effect where stocks tend to go up after he mentions them doesn't mean that he knew that they were going to be going up in price and that he's a genius investor"", ""but generally in the same in the same ballpark so overall great results like other taa strategies you get higher performance with lower risk but to get a better picture of what it's like to live with these portfolios on a month-to-month basis I find it useful to look at the distribution of monthly returns in particular downside returns I think it gives you a better feel for the tail risk or maximum pain point for portfolios so on table two you'll see summary statistics on the monthly returns for two of the portfolio's SP why comp and DM comp vs. various benchmarks so if you look down at the second half second part of the table where I used the percentage numbers I have the distribution of monthly returns basically the average return the standard deviation deviation and the number of months in percentage terms that returns were less than zero less than two and a half percent less than five percent less than ten percent as you can see the TA portfolios as py comp dat M comp and I use Antonetti's gem also as the other ta portfolio compare very well I say are way better than the buy-and-hold portfolios like SPI only 6040 or just a 50/50 split between s py and v EA the International stock index so in general you see the number of months with negative returns less than zero are significantly less than the buy-and-hold portfolios so that's one of the big advantages of of taa strategies so even if ta did not increase returns this net reduction in the downside risk would be a huge benefit but on top of that taa proposed increased results as well however the benefits of taa models or any active management system do not come at zero cost so in this next section we're going to look at an example of model failures using the SP wycombe system as an example but first let's define what failure means I'm gonna go look at it in three ways I'll start with the most obvious since one of the premises of any taa system is to avoid break draw downs which are the biggest during recessions let's look at how well as py comp catches recessions so since 1971 the SP white comp system has caught every recession before a significant market downturn ie no false negatives that's fantastic but that isn't very difficult to do if you're just fitting to historical data therefore out-of-sample testing should be done with the same basic system that is I fitted a shorter time period in 1971 through 2002 for example to see if the system would pick up the subsequent and out-of-sample recession 2007 it did that makes you feel a little better that you're working with a reasonable model the next question becomes how many times did the system trigger outside of a recession that is called a false positive since 1971 there have been six recessions but the ASP wycombe system triggered 31 times outside of recessionary periods that's a lot and it's one of the costs of an active system but we're not investors not a cadet but we're investors not academic economist what we care about is making money and the avoidance of large drawdowns we need to look at the system in terms of that in other words did those triggers hurt us so let's define success as avoiding all monthly market draw downs of more than 10% I think that's a pretty"", ""well the very purpose of active investing is to outperform your benchmark whatever that may be by active investing you are giving yourself a chance of outperforming passive managers on the other hand are accepting their benchmarks performance and they have no chance of outperforming their benchmark by reducing the chance of outperforming the passive manager also reduces the chances of underperforming there will be a slight under performance when compared to an index since indexes don't have fees or transaction costs but investments do while active managers do have the chance of underperforming the market since it is their research that is leading their investments there is a chance that their research is wrong and this could lead to under performance what if that research leads to something useful perhaps that research let them avoid the tech industry right before the tech bubble or perhaps avoided financial stocks in the great recession good research can often lead to useful insight since passive managers are sticking with the market they don't need the research this means that if there's a collapse and the market goes down they go down with it but the same is true on the flip side if the market does great the passive manager will do great right alongside it well since passive managers generally aren't doing much research this leads to lower fees for the investor so at the end of the day the active portfolio manager will try to achieve some objective generally to beat a predetermined benchmark while the passive manager is happy to stick with whatever performance their benchmark achieves now it's important to note they don't necessarily need to be an active investor or a passive investor you can be both for example you could buy a fund that tracks the S&P 500 with let's say 70 percent of your portfolio and with the other 30% you can pick individual stocks to try to beat the S&P 500 they call this a satellite portfolio where your core holding in this case the S&P 500 ETF 4 index fund whatever it might be is the main investment and the other investments can be viewed as individual satellites if your individual investments do well you have a good chance of outperforming but if they do worst in the S&P 500 at least you have that large core holding to keep you close to whatever the S&P 500 does if you have any questions about the world of investing any

'companies']","[""sacrilegious one it is human to earth at the risk of stating the obvious Warren be Buffett and three G's key operate as a human and are prone to not only making mistakes like the rest of us but also to have black blind spots and investing that hood in fact Buffett has been open about his mistakes and how much they have cost him in Berkshire Hathaway shareholders he also has been candid about his blind spots which include an unwillingness to invest in businesses that he does not understand a sphere that only grows as he gets older and the economy changes as well as an excessive trust in the management of companies that invest while he is for the most part an excellent judge of character his investments in Wells Fargo coca-cola and Kraft nine show that he's not perfect the Ford in my view is not with Buffy but with the legions of investors analysts and journals and treatments and investment daily quoting his words as gospel and tarring and feathering anyone who dares to question them to stocks and hot bones in my post on data I look at how companies in the United States have moved away from dividends to buybacks as a way of returning cash that trend though has not been universally welcomed by investors and there remains a significant subset of investors with strategies built around buying stocks with big dividends one reason that stock like Kraft Heinz are attractive to valued conservative value investors is because they offer high dividend yields often much higher than what you would on investing in Treasury bonds or even safe corporate bonds in effect the rationale that investors use is about buying these shares they're in effect getting a bond with the dividends replacing coupons as well as price appreciation from the dogs of the doubt to screening based on Pontiff and Indians the underlying premise is that investors can count more and dividends than on buybacks while it is true that dividends are stickier than buybacks with many companies maintaining or increasing dividends over time these dividend based strategies become delusional when they treat dividends as obligated payments rather than expected once after all much as companies do not like to cut dividends they're not contractually obligated to pay dividends in fact when a stock carries a dividend deal that looks too good to be true it is usually almost always an unsustainable dividend and it's only a question of time before dividends are cut or even stock or the company drives itself into a financial ditch three brand names last a long time but nothing lasts forever a major lodestone of conventional value investing is the while technology cost efficiencies and new products are all comparative advantages that can generate value it is brand name that is the most staying power again that statement reflects the truth which is that brand names last long often stretching over decades but even brand-name benefits fade as in as customers change and companies seek to become global the troubles at Kraft Heinz are part of a much bigger story but some of the most recognized and valued brand names in the 20th century from coca-cola to McDonald's are finding that the magic is fading using my life cycle these companies are aging and no amount of financial engineering or strategic repositioning is going to make them young again for cost-cutting could take you far but no further for the last few decades we have cut a great deal of slack to those who use cost-cutting as that pathway for creating value with many leveraged buyouts and restructurings built almost entirely on its promise don't get me wrong in firms significant cost inefficiencies and block cost-cutting can deliver significant gains and profits but even with these firms those gains will be time limited since there's only so much fat to cut out worse there are firms that find themselves in trouble for a myriad of reasons that have little to do with cost inefficiencies and cutting costs of these firms is a recipe for disaster it is true that 3g did a masterful job cutting costs and increasing margins at mexico's Grupo Modelo the Mexican Brewer that they acquired threw him back but that was because Mandela's Fromm's lend themselves to a cost-cutting solution it may even have worked at craft times initially but at this point the company's prompts have little to do with cost inefficiencies and much to do with a stable of products that's less appealing to customers than it used to be and cost-cutting is the wrong medicine for whatever ails conclusion I hope it that you do not read this as a hit piece and Warren Buffett and/or 3G I admire Buffett's adherence to a core philosophy and his willingness to be open about his mistakes"", ""all right so firstly i just want to read a quick extract from uh buffett's 1981 annual report annual letter and this is under a section that is called berkshire acquisition objectives if you want to kind of go and find the letter i'll leave it linked down in the description below highly recommend reading through as many of these as you can so um basically the sort of preamble before the section i'm about to read buffett is sort of talking about how he'd struggled to find he'd struggled during that particular year to find a lot of private businesses to buy so berkshire hathaway buys both private businesses and public companies uh depending on basically the opportunity set they will tend to move into more heavily into one or the other just depending on kind of the opportunities available if private business investments look more attractive that's where they'll go if public business investments look more attractive that's where they'll go you know just depending on what's available at the time so with that in mind this is what buffett had to say so currently we find values most easily obtained through the open market purchase of fractional positions in companies with excellent business franchises and competent honest managements we never expect to run these companies but we do expect to profit from them we expect that undistributed earnings from such companies will produce full value subject to tax when realized for berkshire and its shareholders if they don't we've made mistakes as to either one the management we have elected to join two the future economics of the business or three the price we have paid we've made plenty of such mistakes both in the purchase of non-controlling and controlling interests and businesses category two miscalculations are the most common and that's referring back to sort of the future economics of the business of course it is necessary to dig deep into our history to find illustrations of such mistakes sometimes as deep as two or three months back for example last year your chairman volunteered his expert opinion on the rosy future of the aluminium business several minor adjustments to that opinion now aggregating approximately 180 degrees have since been required there you have it even the great warren buffett makes mistakes and he makes mistakes very very frequently and they generally fall into one of these three categories so either they partnered with the wrong management they were wrong on the future economics of the business or they simply paid too high a price so i want to walk through in more detail what each of those three things kind of refer to and try to give you some examples along the way um so sit back relax hit like on the video if you do enjoy and let's get straight into that so let's talk about the first mistake that warren buffett lists here with partnering with the wrong management now unfortunately for us as investors there are a whole range of things that managers of businesses ceos cfos boards of directors all sorts of people uh there's a crazy wide range of things that they can do that can really spoil an investment uh for individual stockholders who don't really have much say in kind of controlling and sort of running the business and although there are a wide range of things that can happen there's generally a couple of key kind of ideas that push management teams into making mistakes or doing things that aren't in the interest of shareholders and the first big one that i really like to look at strongly is simply the incentives of management now ideally what you really want as an investor someone at the helm of that company with the exact same incentives as you now the incentive for you as a shareholder is for the share price to go up is for dividend payments and share buybacks and things over time to to go up and for you to get a good long-term return from simply holding shares in that business that is your incentive now the incentive for the management team may be different uh in some cases it's similar um for example if we have someone as a ceo of a business who started that company and they have a very large shareholding in that business or if they have acquired a very large share holding in that business over time you know maybe someone like warren buffett at berkshire hathaway owns about a third of all the shares but didn't actually start the business or perhaps you have someone like mark zuckerberg at facebook who did start the business and has a substantial shareholding in the company if you're in uh and teamed up with one of those types of people you're going to be in a position where the incentives of both you as the shareholder and them as the management team are pretty much exactly aligned now one of the things you can run into every now and then is you have misaligned incentives so you have you as the shareholder hoping that the stock goes up over time and maybe you have a ceo that is incentivized on maybe one or two kind of key metrics within the business that don't always correlate with uh good returns over time now a really good example of this would be something like a management team being incentivized based on revenue growth now revenue growth is fantastic that's something that you ideally need over time in order to grow the earnings of the business generally as well um but there are some dodgy things that you can do to grow revenue without really growing the sort of economic prospects of the underlying business now for example you can go out uh you can borrow a bunch of money and you can acquire another business"", ""and he said that he often goes to Warren Buffett's house on a Sunday afternoon and they kind of just talk business and invest in and Buffett has said to him how many names in the s p are going to be at 15 times earnings in the next 12 months how many of those are going to earn more in five years than they are today with a 90 confidence interval and how many will compound at seven percent a year using a 50 confidence interval Combs kind of described that by going through this exercise you're solving for a range of things and eliminating a lot of businesses very quickly he said you're solving for cyclicality compounding and initial price and Todd Combs actually explained that this is one of the reasons that they found Apple a few years ago they were going through this process in the same three to five companies kind of just kept coming up over and over again and apple was one of those businesses to me this is really interesting because I've heard Buffett talk for years at this point about kind of the concepts behind valuation you know it's the whole a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush and how sure are you that kind of idea that uh Buffett has talked about for a long period of time but I've never seen sort of quantitative metrics put behind it and uh to see this idea of you know 15 times earnings and are they going to earn more in five years with a very high degree of confidence and slightly lower kind of confidence intervals around how long they can compound at a certain rate to have some quantitative data behind how Buffett thinks about that to kind of weed out a lot of stocks that he isn't necessarily interested in that for me is a pretty huge Insight next hot Combs talked quite a bit about company management and how it goes about assessing management teams and so on and some of the ways that he and Buffett think about company management and capital allocation he said businesses are run by people Buffett likes removing the cash from managers and investing it himself my interpretation of that is that's probably one of the reasons that Buffett is such a fan of sheer BuyBacks as opposed to CEOs going out and doing big Acquisitions and so on he also said that you know as we've heard many times before he's looking for a business that a dummy can run because eventually a dummy will run it and there's a very old school Charlie Munger idea about focusing on CEO incentives and that that can tell you a huge amount and there's a couple of things that Todd Combs had to say on that is Todd Combs said if he was 150 dedicated just to analyzing companies he'd focus on Delta reports and see what management is changing from year to year he said in 2005 beer Stearns which obviously ended up going bankrupt in the in the global financial crisis he said beer Stearns changed something very essential in their reports while saying something different to the street or saying something different to investors and analysts article goes on to say that a big signaling effect for Combs is when management changes the key performance indicators for which they are compensated by that's kind of a major red flag for Todd Combs and combs estimated that in the Fortune 500 approximately 20 percent of companies are changing incentive metrics for management and that that's not an accident again to get a really good feel for how management are thinking about running the business and their underlying incentives uh Todd Combs said that if he ever talks with company management he basically asks them two questions firstly he says how long do you spend talking to investors and secondly he says what would you be doing if you were not publicly traded if you were a privately owned business for example um he said the median response is about 25 percent of time is spent talking to investors and in response to the second question about what would they be doing differently if they were a private company um he said that generally management teams list off a few things that make a whole lot of sense and then Combs proceeds to ask them why they don't do that and they say because they feel handcuffed um you know they're forced often times to focus on quarterly performance they don't think they have the proper time Horizons they're not empowered to do the right thing and that's a really good example of again things that you would not like to see Berkshire hathway for example does not care about a quarterly performance at all they care about long-term performance they spend zero time talking to analysts they have you know letters and annual reports and stuff that come out and they have the annual meeting but they don't um you know spend day-to-day time kind of talking to analysts and that's a common theme I've actually seen through a few companies now over time that have successful track records toddcombe spent quite a bit of time talking about how he thinks about valuation and owner earnings for companies so he says that you should focus on basically two things you should focus on unit economics and the underlying business and you should focus on owner earnings as opposed to reported you know generally accepted accounting principles earnings he gave the example of birch Hathaway which you know each quarter has to Mark to Market their stock portfolio that flows through the income statement so in a quarter where the stock market simply goes up a lot berkshire's earnings can look really good and that is obviously not um kind of a true reflection of the underlying operating businesses so you really have to focus on the underlying earnings for a kind of true owner of that business how much cash could be extracted from the business after you know maintenance Capital expenditures and so on so that's one thing he pays a lot of attention to and the other thing like I said was unit economics and that can change quite a bit from business to business so he said for example you can have a software as a service business incurring 100 cents on the dollar and expenses on day one and uh going forward earn whatever the lifetime value of the customers so you have to have a view where you can understand what the financial image looks like for example in the early days of Walmart on Amazon I wouldn't focus on the fact that the reserves seem wrong and quite large look at where where it took them I build out unit growth economics and the case of Walmart look at each individual store and that's your North Star you backtrack""]"

place\xa0\xa0 in the cryptocurrency market in 2023 and Beyond\xa0 but before we get to that let's answer the most\xa0\xa0 basic question what is Solana and what makes it\xa0 special Solana is a platform that seeks to provide\xa0\xa0 a foundation for decentralized applications or\xa0 adapts in a way that prioritizes scalability in\xa0\xa0 this aim Solana is one of several competing\xa0 blockchains of course the original ethereum\xa0\xa0 silica cardano Avalanche e-gold that hopes to\xa0 grow an ecosystem of cryptocurrency powered\xa0\xa0 products and services to differentiate itself\xa0 Solana introduced a combination of architectural\xa0\xa0 design choices that attempts to offer faster or\xa0 transaction settlement times and an infrastructure\xa0\xa0 that focuses on flexibility that enables\xa0 developers to write and launch customizable\xa0\xa0 applications in multiple programming languages\xa0 Solana attempts to achieve a superior level of\xa0\xa0 transaction speed and blockchain scalability\xa0 Solana is doing this by building on top of\xa0\xa0 several pillars of innovation that make the chain\xa0 faster and more secure these features or pillars\xa0\xa0 are set to revolutionize the world of dapps and\xa0 transactions let's dig in Salon operates on top\xa0\xa0 of eight core components or pillars to achieve\xa0 what it has achieved and aims to achieve proof\xa0\xa0 of History Gulf Stream sea level turbine Cloud\xa0 break pipeline archivers while technologically\xa0\xa0 complex and intricate each component is meant\xa0 to optimize the amount of transactions Solana\xa0\xa0 can execute without sharding its chain or using\xa0 a layer 2 Network a little bit more detail Salon\xa0\xa0 you uses a unique hybrid consensus mechanism\xa0 a combination of proof of stake and proof of\xa0\xa0 work to achieve these faster confirmation\xa0 times to achieve the lower transaction fees\xa0\xa0 and to reduce its energy consumption this is\xa0 compared to traditional proof of work the tldr\xa0\xa0 on the architecture the way the chain is set up\xa0 is Solana and L1 chain offers Speedy streamlined\xa0\xa0 transactions with instant finality low

some ways\xa0\xa0 as Solana become so popular"", ""so let's take a look first on our list today is polygon ranked number 10 at one dollar a protocol with massive defy utility huge total value locked and custom tools for onboarding to the ecosystem from ethereum they're also now hosting a zke evm version of polygon that is secured through zero knowledge proof technology taking a look at defy llama we see that total value locked on polygon currently exceeds one billion dollars with daily users easily exceeding 200 000 sometimes exceeding three hundred thousand depending on the day hosting many of the same dapps that you can find on the ethereum mainnet polygon is a much more economically effective way to transact with many of the same Assets Now D5 utility alone is not what makes polygon a big pick on our list today instead it is Corporate Partnerships here we see the likes of DraftKings stripe Reddit Adidas Adobe and meta as well as others including Starbucks listed as major partners with polygon ecosystem this is unlike anything that we are seeing anywhere else and as a result we definitely have a bright future on the horizon for a polygon at least that's what we're expecting taking a quick look at polygon socials we see regular Twitter updates from the protocol as we would expect also a great sign and consistent with their high profile corporate presence all this in mind it's no question that we see articles from this month suggesting that the token price has not yet caught up to the network growth if it does catch up that's going to mean a strong appreciation for Matic holders so definitely come something to keep in mind with polygon we have what I would consider the corporate leader in the space today given the number of Partnerships they have and the number of daily users for a scaled chain next up is what some consider to be the technological leader in crypto today let's take a look second on our list today is Cosmos Hub now Cosmos Hub is the primary Network behind the cosmos ecosystem and along with the other networks that are part of the cosmos ecosystem full interoperability via Cosmos inter blockchain connectivity is possible again taking a look at socials we see great updates from the platform on a near daily basis in fact more than one today and at least one a day last week as well very very similar to what we saw with polygon we see that recent articles suggest that the value of the cosmos asset is inconsistent with the total value locked on the platform and that the rate that the asset is appreciating is inconsistent with the market overall what this may mean is that we are about to experience an increase in price another recent article from amb crypto here we see that the value of Cosmos Adam in general has reached a new support level which may indicate a good entry point for those interested in investing in the ecosystem one of the exciting things about Cosmos ecosystem is that each chain is capable of supporting up to 10 000 transactions per second and those transactions can be processed simultaneously between connected chains allowing for horizontal scaling in a way that we have not seen before in blockchain this next one's going to come as no surprise but let's talk about why it might be the best hard money in existence today next on our list is ethereum and the asset if so why is the number two Network in the world also on this list well the number one reason is security there is no defy environment in the world that is going to guarantee you better security than ethereum one positive advantage to ethereum is that while there is a foundation behind the protocol they do not have full Sovereign control of the protocol it is a fully decentralized protocol and to an extent that we do not see with other networks if you couple this with the ultrasound money movement which carefully illustrates that ethereum is a deflationary asset continually removing ethereum from the supply if we look at the last seven days we've removed 23 000 ethereum if we instead look since the merge then we're looking at more than a hundred and twelve thousand ethereum that has been removed from circulation since the merge all in all we should consider ultrasound money a long-term movement for the token one that will eventually reach equilibrium because the burn rate and the production rate are the same this is not expected to occur until April 2223 a Time Horizon which is much longer than the Horizon that we see for most assets suggesting that this may in fact be a store of intergenerational wealth at least that's what it's gearing up to be so far we've taken a look at polygon Cosmos and ethereum all ecosystems that have proven themselves capable of transacting to the tune of billions of dollars this is already happening and something really to get excited about but what about ecosystems that are on their way up that may be capable of doing what those first three have done but just aren't quite there yet let's take a look at one that's just like that fourth on our list today is Radix possibly the network with the most Buzz around production D5 chains worldwide what do I mean by that well Radix has just launched and is showing a very promising price appreciation since the beginning of the year taking a look at the 90-day time frame we see strong appreciation since the beginning of the year are definitely a great sign this is consistent with the growth and total value locked on the platform Radix stands to revolutionize the way that we do defy by introducing immutable token rules for the protection of users and developers this is accomplished by the chain itself defining simple functions like a token something which behaves in a way we would expect a token to work in the real world rather than allowing for flexibility that leads to token absurdity the novelty of this technology it seems is not lost in the market as we see 100 and 76 percent surge this month as reported by coindesk this resulted in xrd reaching a 12-month high of 15 cents if we take a look at the price today we see that it is now back at just under 10 cents and possibly signifying a great entry point for those interested further iteration upon important Primitives such as interoperability are a key objective of Radix and help to solidify its position as a narrative setting protocol this next pick is controversial because in spite of the fact that etherscan has reported over 330 000 holders and in spite of the fact that the fully diluted market cap as reported by etherscan is 34 billion dollars both coin Gecko and coin market cap are censoring this protocol in their ranking that's right both of them are strap in because here's the real facts on Hex let's go last on our list today is hex possibly the strongest Community token in the world right now"", ""the total number of Terra devs currently stands at around 70 and appears to be in an uptrend I suppose dokwon got the gang back together in Serbia or wherever Jokes Aside more than 50 percent of terror's pre-crash devs threw in the towel after Luna and UST went to zero the other 45 or so went to other crypto ecosystems with a third going to Cosmos a third going to Terror 2.0 and the final third going to unspecified crypto ecosystems then after comparing current crypto Dev metrics against those from the 2018 crypto bear Market the authors present this amazing picture it shows you the growth in full-time devs that's full time for different crypto ecosystems over time from when the first code commit was published to GitHub the picture is a bit messy but it's clear that polka dots growth has been very impressive and by that I mean its Dev count has grown faster than ethereums did when it was getting started polkadot also seems to be the only crypto project that's managed to maintain a larger growth rate than ethereums the authors then zoom in on newer crypto projects and protocols this is where start net which is again arguably part of ethereum Aptos and the BNB chain Reigns Supreme unfortunately development on the BNB chain has since stalled and the correlation appears to be very close to crypto prices the authors go on to underscore the fact that 37 of crypto ecosystems with more than 50 full-time devs are leveraging the ethereum virtual machine or evm for smart contracts these numbers are debatable because as we've seen many of these evm projects belong in ethereum's ecosystem it looks like the reason why the authors insist on segregating these ethereum projects into their own ecosystems is because their own analysis suggests that most evm devs stick to a single evm chain this flies in the face of the popular narrative that evm devs copy and paste from ethereum if I understand correctly projects on ethereum's polygon side chain are the least likely to be copy and pasted to other evm chains this makes sense considering that polygon is basically a copy of ethereum that is extremely fast and the polygon itself provides lots of funding to projects that commit to it more about polygon in the description now on the other side of the spectrum you have Avalanche whose projects have seen the most deployments to other evm chains this again makes sense because avalanche's ecosystem had the most exposure to Terror this includes the Avalanche Foundation itself which lost a lot when Terror collapsed evm projects that have deployed to other evm chains have overwhelmingly chosen optimism and arbitrum as their number one destinations this makes sense considering that both layer twos will soon be seeing a massive scalability upgrade when ethereum introduces dank sharding sometime in the summer in the third part of the report the authors touch on popular crypto use cases now this section focuses a lot on ethereum and it starts with the authors showcasing the ethereum dapps that have generated the most fees these are the openc nft marketplace the uni swap decks and tethers usdt stablecoin based on these top contracts the authors conclude that nfts and defy are the most popular use cases in cryptocurrency at the moment this might sound like a biased assessment but remember that we're talking about 2022 here other smart contract cryptocurrencies didn't see that much activity anyways the authors reveal that there are almost 4 000 D5 focused devs as of December 2022.""]"

resistance here these candles right here so with that being the case right in this area if we can get a move up and then I move back down into this little bazan we just drew near 1.7 4-4-2 if we get a pullback into that zone it's going to be a great place for us to start looking for Tran continuation opportunities here on the euro New Zealand now a cool part of this we're on the daily chart now delete our drawings again we're gonna drop down to a smaller time frame this is our whole technical analysis approach given to you guys so here we are and what if on this time frame probably not gonna happen here let's go ahead and go down to another time frame what if only one hour time frame here we go so something we can throw in here we're doing technical analysis we can use indicators structure and trend we've already talked about trend and structure we're definitely in an uptrend here only you're in New Zealand as of recently because we just broke out of that period of consolidation on the daily chart and four hour and one our charts are both in uptrend now also we know that this is our most previous level of structural resistance that's been broken makes it a highly likely place to find some kind of support out of this market now what if we start throwing in indicators what if we wait to see if this market gets down to our around one point force probably one point seven for one point seven four five sorry about that guys and up to this black line in that zone what if we wait for the market to get down into that area and when it does get into this area this market becomes oversold and then we find an entry reason based on an oversold over bolt strategy do you guys see the power of doing all this technical analysis before you place a trade based on a strategy you've tested if you've tested oversold markets and then some type of entry reason based on a candlestick pattern or something else in an oversold market and it's proven to be profitable over time doing this technical analysis ahead of time can significantly increase your chances of being right or being correct on that specific trade now beyond that guys this is not something you need to go out and just start doing you have to test for this you have to test and see well what is my likelihood of winning when I placed this trade based on the strategy I've created let's say with RSI being oversold or overbought at levels of structure there's a way to test that guys you can test it using swapping back and forth between daily and four-hour in one-hour charts maybe having all three of them on the screen at the same time I know it's hard work and it sounds like a lot of time you're gonna have spend doing it and that's true but it is completely and utterly necessary for you to do that those are the secrets that we use each and every time we place a trade if you guys are interested in being notified about the advanced pattern mastery course the links in the description if you wanna get your hands on the free three-part training series we use when we trade reversals then we have that available for about 24 more hours guys that's gonna be going very very soon we're going to include it in the EAP training program I just want to offer to you guys for free for a little bit of time we've had that out and free for a little over a month now so you should have been able to get your hands on it if you haven't we're gonna leave it open for about 24 hours and it's in the description as well and guys finally if you're ready to take your trading to the next level and discover some more advanced techniques and trading entries that we use here at the trading channel on a daily basis to make profits then we also have a link in the description for our flagship program called the EAP training program this program has been taken by thousands of traders and created great results in their trading now that in no way is a guarantee of your success because your success will highly depend on what you do and if you're not someone willing to put in the effort to become profitable then you're not a match for us here at the trading channel at least not in the EAP training program I will gladly continue to produce free content for you and we can hang out here on YouTube videos but we only want the most dedicated traders involved in the program because we have a goal

button pull me before you go and I'll talk to you guys in the next video"", ""alright so now that we've quickly been over the anatomy of a candlestick let's jump into what these candlesticks actually represent and then later on we'll discuss how we can use candlestick charts to predict market direction all right guys so let's dive into what these candlesticks actually represents well each one of these candlesticks represents a specific time period if I click over here on time periods you can see that we have time periods ranging from one minute all the way to one month so with that being the case if we were to click the one-minute chart then each candlestick would represent one minute or 60 seconds of price action we would have the open of a candlestick every 60 seconds on that one-minute candlestick chart we would have price fluctuating within those 60 seconds down to the low up to the high and then we would also have the close of a candle every 60 seconds so each one of these candlesticks would represent 60 seconds on a one-minute chart and if we were on a one-month chart if we go all the way to the other end of the spectrum then the same rules apply if we were only one month chart if we were to click this one month chart here then each candlestick on that chart would represent four weeks of price action we would have an opened at the beginning of the four weeks we would have price action in between the four weeks going to the low and the high of the wick or the shadows of the candles and that's what would represent where price actions been and then we would have a close of the candle at the end of four weeks all of this is represented about one candlestick depending on the time frame your own so currently we're on a one-week chart that means that when we scroll down the chart here each one of these candlesticks represent a full week of price action for the green candlesticks we have a full week of price action that started at the open or the bottom of the green candle we have price action in between represented by these wicks coming down to the low and moving up to the high and then at the end of the week we have the close of the candle so that represents a bullish week in price action for our current pair currently we are only pound allsey so for this pair during this full week of price action we had a bullish week represented by this candle now the same thing applies for a bearish week and I'll go through that really quickly so for this case we have an open at the top of the body is where this market opened we have where price has been represented by the wicks the high and the low of the red candle and the close of the candle at the end of the week at the bottom of that body so that would represent a bearish week of price action and again guys these same rules apply no matter what time frame we're on and this can go anywhere from a 1-minute chart all the way up to a one-month chart so each one of these candlesticks represents a certain period of time and once we start putting these candlesticks together is when we can start determining market Direction based on candlestick charts so that's what we're gonna dive into now so combining all of these candlesticks together is how we can start to actually determine market direction and determine trend and also determine structure levels such as support and resistance and these are going to all be foundational parts of success in any trading career on any market understanding how to read a candlestick chart is the foundation of any good trading strategy so we have a starting point down here correct this market pushed up from this level with a nice impulsive move indicating a lot of buyers coming in from that direction now we're looking for next is to see if that level is broken so we have a high and when I say high this time I'm not talking about the high of a single candlestick I'm talking about the high that's represented about the combination of candlesticks throughout this impulsive move up which was right here the high is what's created before the pullback so this pullback represents people selling from the market a combination of people selling and the reason they're selling can be because of many different factors some people that were in down here at this level that we started from are now just taking profit other people may be jumping in based on some type of fundamental news release or based on some type of technical analysis but all of that is really irrelevant information because all we want to do is look at the chart and understand what it's doing so once we've created that high we're looking for a pullback and then the creation of a new high this 3-point move is how we can start to determine market direction once we have this 3-point move a low to a high to a pullback or higher low to a new high once that's created then we can determine that the market direction is currently up the market Direction is bullish and with that being the case we have the ability to restrict ourselves to only bullish trades to only long trades and this can really be beneficial to a trading strategy now what are we looking for after this 3-point move and this is where a lot of traders get confused well we're looking for this uptrend to continue before the break of our support level this is our support level so before this support level gets broken we expect the market to come up and break above this resistance level and continue our uptrend and that's exactly what we get here we have this pullback again selling pressure from taking profit from traders taking positions based on fundamental news events and traders taking positions based on technical analysis and then we have another push up continuing our uptrend because we've now broken above our previous high and since we have a break above our previous high into a new high we expecting we're expecting another new high"", ""but what do they actually mean well these candlesticks are nothing more than a representation of price moving over a certain period of time a daily chart would be a representation of a full day of price if this was a one-hour chart and not a daily chart it would be a representation of one day of price and what they need to be recognized as is with a green candle the green candle normally represents an update meaning that this area here is the open the bottom of the body is the open this here is the low it is the low point of the pot of the candle the bottom of that wick is the low point of this 24-hour period represented by our green candle this high point is the high of this 24-hour period and this is the close of that candle so if this candle would have started at 5:00 p.m. and then ended at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time then this is exactly what it would look like if we had an open here price moved down from our open to our low price then moved back up to our high and then price came back down and finally closed right here that is exactly what these candlesticks mean that's a great presentation of a green candlestick or a positive day in price if you're looking at a daily chart a negative day is shown by this red candle here so on this red candle we have a very similar setup except instead of the bottom of the body being to open on a red candle the top of the body is the open the top of this wick is still the high of this candle the bottom wick is still the low of this candle and the bottom of the body is the close of this candle so in the representation of this candle what we would have seen if we were watching this on a daily chart is this candle would have opened here it then went to pushed up to the high and then pushed all the way down to the low and then eventually pushed back up to close that 24-hour period right there at the bottom of this red candle so that's how you see a candlestick and that's how that's how you break down the anatomy of each and every one of these candlesticks it represents a certain amount of time depending on the time period your own everything would be exactly the same if this was one hour instead of daily this was one hour then that would still be the exact same anatomy of a candlestick so now that we've broken debt that down a little bit let's head down to a different white screen and take a look at the four green candles we were looking at right at the intro of the video so now can you spot the similarities of any of these right now what I'm gonna do is go ahead and tell you the similarity and teach you the candlestick pattern that I never hear talked about here on YouTube and that I think is one of the most accurate candlestick patterns you can use for a buying trade and that is each one of these candles closes in the top 95% of the candle each one of these candles has either a tiny wick on it or no wick on the top at all and with these being green candles what that means is that the end of whatever time period let's just say we're still on the daily for simplicity at the end whatever time period we are looking at this candle closed nearly at its high at the highest point that the participants of the market pushed this candle it dropped barely any which means there was not many sellers at the end of this candle at the end of this period if we have little to no wicks on the top of these candles that means there were no sellers at the end of this period so that gives us a good representation that we could possibly see a market head higher from a candlestick like this and the way I defined this whenever I'm trading on a 4-hour chart I'm mostly trade on for hour and you can set a Fibonacci retracement like this let me go and show you how to identify the candle so you can take a Fibonacci retracement let me put it on my candle you can then adjust your Fibonacci retracement number change it to 0.05 percent and now all you have to ask yourself is did this candle you pull a retracement from the low of the candle to the the candle did this candle land the body of the candle close above the top 5% of the candle and if the answer is yes then you have a correct candlestick formation and as you can tell each of these do that so that's one way to spot this gamma stick pattern what I do is just look for the market to only have a 5 pip wick at the top of the candle or less 5 to 6 fifths is the max so a max 5 to 6 pip wick on the top of the candle when I'm trading on a 4-hour chart but you can also use the Fibonacci tool that might make it a little bit easier for you like I said grab your Fibonacci tool with the correct setting of a 5% top 5% of the candle and then there we have it every time you want to see if you are trading the correct pattern you can just use the Fibonacci tool and make sure that that candlestick closed in the top 5% and again if it did close in that top 5% then chances are there was no buying meaning excuse me there was no selling pressure at the end of that time period so chances are there's gonna be buying pressure in the next period and that's what makes this candlestick pattern so powerful now let's move on to actually finding a few of these on sharp data and then I'll teach you a full strategy you can actually test and show you my back testing data of that strategy right after we go over this candlestick pattern on actual charts see you in just a second""]"

Ripple and the SCC SEC led by Gary gunzler does not want to lose this case and I'm rooting for ripple to win because Garrett Gensler wants Total Domination over the crypto Market he wants to declare everything as security and basically have full control and that's not what we want Ripple is fighting the good fight right now and hopefully they win but the latest is this expert testimony this is the defense that Ripple needs which is the previous testimony from the prior director of the SEC declaring ethereum is a commodity not a security an SEC has been fighting tooth and nail not to give this up to Ripple is been a year-long battle many many many court cases and extensions and delayed Ripple won every single one and SEC is still fighting to get an extension to exclude the expert testimony because SCC knows that if Ripple gets the prior testimony from a prior director of the SEC Ripple has all all needs to win so that is why the SEC and Gary does not want this to happen but this could definitely be solved or resolved within 2023 I would say the first half of 2023 and if it goes in Ripple's favor it will be absolutely huge for xrp and it'll be absolutely huge for the

building such as solid secure decentralized infrastructure now this is what we're looking at defy llama you see ethereum binance smart train or binance smart chain you go down number 15 cardano now D5 is coming online working its way up and does it stop at 15 I highly highly doubt that I think cardano is going to rock it itself up into the top of this list and that's a that's a steady progress right that takes some time but we're getting hints of it right now and this is why we call it cardano defy summer and this is from a few days ago start of cardano's D5 summer propels it into top 15 blockchain by volume cardano has recently experienced a surge in its defy volume thanks to the emergence of more decentralized protocols in the popularity of community focused meme coins like snack cardano has climbed the ranks to become one of the top 15 blockchains in terms of D5 volume and you go over here to cardano and just look at it everybody look at this chart just all-time highs in terms of total value locks in cardano D5 look at that and so you see this too and you can you can scroll down in from a micro perspective on these projects and see for yourself what is actually happening you go over here and we are it's it's happening everybody this is the first time I'm mentioning this in a video snack and and I hope it's appreciated why I take time in covering these things

crypto where cardano coins are going to be competing with and in their own sector right with ethereum coins and and all these other blockchain coins and here's a perfect example it's going to start

S&P500 High dividend low volatility ETF this ETF invests into 50 Securities traded on the S&P500 Index that historically provided High dividends and low volatility so right now one share of sphd is trading at 42.79 with a 52-week low of 38.33 at a 52-week high of 49.61 we have net Assets in this fund of 3.34 billion dollars an average dividend yield of 4.29 year-to-day daily total return of negative 4.3 percent and expense ratio of 0.3 so taking a look at the one-year price chart we can see we started off the last year at around 42 a share it went all the way up to about 50 a share drop back down to around 42.50 went back up to 47.50 and is now down to around 43 dollars this is a large value category fund and looking at these sector weightings we can see we are heavy in financial services real estate consumer defensive health care and utilities the average price earnings ratio in this fund is going to be 18.09 the average price book ratio is 2.4 and the average price of sales ratio is 1.37 the top three Holdings in this fund are going to be Iron Mountain Inc Ultra group and PPL Corp so you can see that year to date this ETF declined just 5.75 this shouldn't come as a surprise because what this ETF does is basically tracks the cream of the crop as we all know the S&P500 tracks the top 500 companies of the world and so for this ETF to track the highest paying stocks out of the top 500 makes this a really solid option for many dividend investors going for more of a safer ETF like sphd doesn't necessarily mean you won't be getting good returns either it's good to keep in mind that long-term gains are not only determined by the amount of money you make through dividends but also by the amount of money you're able to avoid losing if you take a look at the fund's Historical performance we can see that they've almost always underperformed the broad Market but in reality that's the trade-off for being able to sleep at night knowing that your investment is much safer during recessions with sphd you can set yourself up for consistent High dividend payments over a long period of time without having to worry about losing money from investing at the wrong time"", ""this year has seen some big declines in the price looking at the different sectors you can see that we are heavy in financials utilities real estate and communication Services the top three Holdings in this fun are going to be City Group JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo so this ETF is designed to give out a good amount of dividends but not a lot in terms of capital appreciation for your investment they do this by keeping a majority of their Holdings in well-known financial institutions that likely aren't going to change dividends for a long time a unique advantage of PGX is the fact that it has Preferred shares this means that you are entitled to dividends Before Common shareholders making you the first to receive dividends and also the last to have your dividends decreased overall a good ETF that I encourage you guys to do more research about and last up on the list we have div otherwise known as the super divin us ETF this ETF invests in the top 50 highest dividend paying equities in the US while also looking for equities that have low betas relative to the S&P500 to reduce volatility right now one share of div is trading at 19.20 with a 52-week low of 17.37 and a 52-week high of 21.84 cents we have Devin yield of 6.78 a year-to-date daily Total return of negative of 5.48 and expense ratio of 0.45 here's a price chart for the last year you can see it's largely moved sideways but did see a pretty big drop back in August and September of this year followed by a small recovery this is going to be a mid cap value fund and looking at the sector weddings we can see that we are heavy in real estate consumer defensive Healthcare utilities energy and Industrials our average PE ratio in this fund is 15.06 the average price to book ratio is 2.29 and the average price of sales ratio is 1.12 the top three Holdings in this fund are going to be Holly Energy Partners Iron Mountain Inc and CubeSmart so stocks with low beta essentially have prices that don't change too drastically meaning div looks at the top 50 dividend paying stocks in the S&P500 that have the least volatility we can see just how stable they are when looking at the one-year return on div at negative 5.6 percent which is not by at all compared to the broader markets like the S&P500 looking at their dividend history we can also see that div has made monthly distributions for eight whole years making their track record for payouts really good div is also another smart beta ETF which means they take all these stocks in the S&P500 and also factor out the highest dividend paying stocks"", ""and yeah at the end of the day investing takes a lot of emotional strength but because sphd is specifically designed to minimize volatility it makes for a great investment for many people that want something easy to stick with okay next on the list is sdiv which is the global X super dead than ETF this ETF has 107 of the highest dividend paying equities around the world making this one of the highest income potential stocks on this list right now one share of sdiv is trading at 7.74 cents the 52 Week low is 7.38 cents and the 52 week high is 13 and 18 cents we have net assets of 661.74 million dollars the crazy high yield of 15.9 percent year-to-date daily Total return of negative 30.87 and a pretty high expense ratio of 0.58 if you take a one year price chart you can see the performance has not been good we went from over 13 a share to just under eight dollars per share which is a huge huge drop looking at the sector winnings we can see that we are heavy in basic materials Financial Services real estate energy and Industrials our average PE ratio in this fund is 3.84 the average price the book ratio is 0.98 and the average price of sales ratio is 0.74 three biggest Holdings in this fund are going to be electric consumer products China dongshan group and transmissor now because they invest in equities all around the world your investment is Diversified in terms of geographic location and interest rates globally everyone knows that inflation rates in the country are experiencing record highs and so this ETF is great for people that want to diversify away from the rising inflation and interest rates in the US sdiv also has a great track record in terms of paying out dividends to shareholders as they've made monthly payments to investors for over 10 years they're able to pay out a good amount in dividends because of their smart beta stock strategy where they try to outperform the market through a set of higher risk higher return rules these rules are used to determine what investments should be included in the portfolio now this differs from the traditional method of tracking stocks through market cap as this ETF tracks stocks through their market cap as well as their dividend yield now this may sound risky but again the Holdings are spread out across different sectors of the world balancing out the non-traditional stock strategies used within this ETF this could be a great strategy for people that are trying to significantly beat interest rates through high income potential coupled with a high dividend yield all in all another saw all ETF with high paying dividends that you should consider investing into and number two we have PGX also known as invesco's preferred ETF the CTF is invested in a total of 294 stocks that must be rated at least B3 based on the three leading rating agencies Moody s p and Fitch so right now one share of PGX is trading at 11.22 with a 52-week low of 11.05 and a 52 week high of 15 and 19 cents this fund has net assets of 5.12 billion dollars a dividend yield of 5.8 percent year-to-date daily Total return of negative 21.2 percent and a relatively High expense ratio of 0.51 here's the price chart for the last year you can see we have seen pretty consistent downward Trends in the price if we zoom out even further we can see this is the growth from about 2013.""]"

last year in our web archives we can see that the hundred ounce bars trading around sixteen dollars an ounce when silver was around fifteen fourteen dollars at the time so again around a dollar or two over spot at the moment it's seven dollars over spot because there's just such a huge demand again Keith talks about this where on their website when silver fell from 18 to 12 they didn't drop their price down from their coins because they thought that's not fair value so all these guys to have their price up where they had it when silver was $18 an ounce so now we get to how we can take advantage of this and we want to use these different products so if we head over to eToro where i trade might you know my ETFs where it's the US markets and we're not things that we otherwise access to in Australia this is currently trading for $30 $30 below the actual silver price the ETF tends to track so we can do at the moment is by the SLV ETF and when it silver goes back to 18 or 21 dollars an ounce where I think it's going to go the price of silver here and the profits you're going to make are going to be up 50% from let's call it $14 to $21 to use round numbers that's a 50% gain so you're gonna be in 50% profit but at that stage once the the price of silver gets back up to 21 these hundred ounce bars you know they're only gonna be a dollar or two over spot so they're going to be trading for hopefully 22 maybe 23 dollars an ounce over spot now these are in aussie dollar prices so you know let's not get confused with all the math there but the point is that it's going to go from this beak gap at the moment which is currently around $7 back to around a dollar or two so while that is happening let's take advantage of that and let's ride the fake paper price up these ETF price up put on our traders hat make that extra money hopefully we've got 50% extra money and then we can choose to head over to our favorite bullion dealer and buy physical silver so if you do plan on doing that we're still running that promotion we also get $100 a Bitcoin when you sign up I'll put that link down below there's other ways to do this FTX have got their gold token XA UT and the packs g token so both of those are gold tokens or futures contracts we can arbitrage do the same arbitrage with gold that we just spoke about Aynsley have also got their gold and silver tokens over on

agreement reasserts by central banks the importance of gold as an asset in global monetary reserves the first central bank gold agreement was created in 1999 and was known as the washington agreement on gold at the time central banks held about 33 000 tons of gold which was about a quarter of all gold estimated to be above ground the central bank gold agreement was created because market fears about central bank intentions on gold caused the price of gold to decrease and become less stable in addition it caused an instability in the value of the assets of central banks this was also causing considerable hardship for gold producing countries many of which were heavily indebted poor countries the central bank gold agreement was signed by 15 european central banks the 11 central banks of the countries that were at the time members of the eurozone and also by sweden switzerland the uk and also the ecb in addition a number of other major holding central banks including the us japan australia the imf and the bank for international settlements either formally associated themselves with the agreement or announced that they would not sell gold with a five-year lifespan a new agreement that contains basically the same language has been signed every five years the agreement stated that gold would remain an important element of global monetary reserves and it agreed to limit the total combined sales of gold by central banks to 400 tons a year they also agreed that their lending and use of derivatives would not increase over the same five-year period in the press release for the first central bank gold agreement on september 26 1999 central bank stated the following quote in the interest of clarifying their attentions with respect to their gold holdings the undersigned institutions make the following statement gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves the undersigned institutions will not enter the market as sellers with the exception of already decided sales the gold sales already decided will be achieved through a concerted program of sales over the next five years annual sales will not exceed approximately 400 tons and total sales over this period will not exceed 2 000 tons the signatories to this agreement have agreed not to expand the gold leasings and their use of gold futures and options over this period this agreement will be reviewed after five years unquote in 2004 the second central bank gold agreement was signed for the second central bank gold agreement the wording was basically the same as the first one except the limit on the maximum total gold that central banks could sell was increased from 400 tons a year to 500.', ""hi folks dave waring here again with informed trades calm and the next video in a series on trading the economic crisis by summit patel in our last video cimmyt gave us a good overview of the inflation versus deflation argument in today's video we begin a new section of this series where simha is going to explore several markets where traders can express their inflation or deflation bias starting with today's video on gold so let's get started okay to understand why gold is a is a way to protect yourself in the events of an economic crisis particularly a currency crisis we sort of need we can start by by looking at economic history and how economies first of all and before there was paper money and coins that people use to trade and shop and make purchases or manage manage their wealth people bartered so for instance if I made coffee beans and you made a cotton you know we may be able to do a trade if I want a continent you wanted coffee beans of course the the problem with barter economies is that there needs to be a mutual advantage so in the example I gave you know we could only do a cotton for coffee trade if you wanted the coffee beans that I was making and if I wanted the cotton that you were produced so what naturally arose in barter economies is that the the thing or the commodity that was easiest to trade would become money so for instance let's say I had coffee beans when you were making cotton but let's say you didn't really want coffee beans uh what you you may still accept it you may still accept the coffee things that I was offering in exchange for cotton if you thought you could take those coffee beans and easily trade them for something else that you did one and if you look on the screen now there's there's a picture of cigarettes vodka and beads you know trinkets and those are all examples of currencies that have arisen in barter economies back then in many prisons now where they don't really have money but people still feel a desire to trade or can i exchange favors and things like that cigarettes are still used as as form of currency and they leaving me accepted by people who aren't smokers because the non-smokers will take them knowing that they can trade them for or something else if everyone in the currency crisis in Russia in the late 90s they saw vodka bottles of vodka become my currency if you would trade that things they won now throughout time barter economies have repeatedly chosen gold as the current that is original gold is sort of the natural currency that has that has arisen out of barter economies and this is something that's been true throughout the world and throughout history many other commodities have been tried and gold has sort of always been chosen so it has a sort of rich history and sort of there's a psychological attachment as well to cold that's been the the monetary commodity of choice for so long in terms of why the market chose gold repeatedly it's because gold has some attributes that make it really perfect or ideal for being for being a form of money one is that it's pretty portable easy to take around the other one that's storable it does not deteriorate over time which makes it conducive to saving and accruing wealth and making investments and credit and allowing an economy to grow easy to count which makes it just very simple for doing we're doing transactions easy to divide which sort of goes along with being easy to count you can do small transaction as well as larger transactions with it naturally scarce which is a key a key element and something that we're always reminded of when when the currency is being significantly devalued as you know the one of the principal reasons the currency is going to be significantly the valued is when it's been there's too much of it too much money has been created with gold that doesn't really happen because it's naturally scarce so that's one of its most one of the most important attributes and hard to counterfeit which all sort of ties into being naturally scarce you know it's hard to counterfeit and that sort of keeps its supply limited as well as keeping the economy more on and sort of tying into how goal has been with us for so long are sort of the first currents that arose even the US dollar was once pegged to gold you know prior to the Great Depression you know the the price of twenty dollars was always convertible for an ounce of gold so if you had twenty dollars you knew that you can get an ounce gold for it and that sort of instituted some monetary discipline in the sense that the government always need to make sure that they could not they can honor that that exchange that if someone to cash in their twenty dollars for an ounce gold they could do so after the great depression is repriced to thirty-five dollars an ounce and then in nineteen seventy one the gold sin who was fully abolished and there was no peg on the screen now you can see a hundred dollar gold certificate which I was a circulation in the early part of the twentieth century which shows that that a hundred dollars in gold shows the sort of gold was money here in the United States not that long ago so really that monetary history of gold mega money is something that really is been with us for a while and it's not as as archaic as many would think and even still you know when we now that we know how much of a history gold has even still now when there's problems with with the paper currencies fiat currencies that the government's issue the market still naturally tends to gravitate towards gold as sort of a way they can hedge themselves against currency risk knowing that in a worst-case scenario they could always trade gold coins if they absolutely needed to that's it's obviously not preferable but it is a sort of an option and is an insurance policy of sorts so even as this current crisis the United States is unfolded we've seen central banks increase their gold the gold positions""]"

helpful Direction in essence Claude has been called the AI with a moral compass in effect it's built a system that is less likely to produce that harmful output it's easier to hold a conversation with and easier to use with less effort so while chat gbt may still be better for tasks such as programmer coding and generation anthropic's Claude could become a more human-centered chat system anthropic

the sky to destroy a small pixelated drone this will allow you to push up freely giving you first Contact of the fight you can also use this distraction created from the gun noise to attract nearby enemies you can leave your drone outside the ring to scan for unsuspecting teams as the Drone sound is masked by the ring audio and the orange aura Blends in with the ring this tip is more useful in ranked but use your drone to scout for unoccupied spaces for your team to push too this can give you the advantage for being in a good spot for zone or for pinching teams when looking to climb up the ranks bring your drone Up When approaching fights to earn free assists however do not stay in drone for too long and grieve your teammates a balance of drone usage and fighting abilities are needed to rank up properly look for unopened bins and open them in drone to earn five crafting materials giving you the ability to craft what you need instead of having to run around the area one of the most dangerous ultimates in the game the EMP deals a hundred to active corsic traps and destroys and active barrels 100 to octane's jump pad and removes the amp section of rampart's walls and disables stationary Sheila for around 20 seconds it also deals 100 damage to both parts of newcastle's mobile Shields and permanently disables the electricity on his Ultima it also cancels valcol if she has Shield EMP also destroys lober's Black Market Sears exhibit Mirage decoys and lifeline's healing drone coordinating emps with your teammates that use a movement Legend ability such as octane's pad Horizon Q Rave portal or Pathfinder Zips can catch enemies off guard as they are healing or running away making escapes impossible with discount Nation try to exit your drone a few seconds before your EMP detonates that gives you those crucial moments to catch enemies awaiting their Doom the Reliance on having to pick up Fallen teammate banners with your drone aren't as important anymore since support players are able to craft their banners back but still remember your drone's 200 meter range to take your time and create a safe distance between your enemies to pick up the banners you can also help create that safe distance by EMP enemies as you grab the banner lowering their sensitivity making it hard for them to track and shoot the Drone as crypto has lost the ability to scan the next ring you can somewhat determine the next Zone by looking at the enemies that are crowded together this also means you might be able to third party if you're fast enough or look for fights that are more isolated from everyone else stopping you from being third-partied as well unfortunately crypto has no moving abilities is important to learn movement techniques and memorize building layouts to Advantage for quick and easy escapes carry at least one Autumn accelerant which removes roughly A Min net of your cooldown this prepares for unexpected fights in which you don't have your ultimate already and you can use one after the fight to prepare for the next one it is also very useful to craft or carry a Mobile Beacon you can rest teammates in the safe spot instantly especially if your support Legend teammates craft the banner back some cryptos have a tendency of hitting themselves with their EMP so it's useful to wear gold armor to heal yourself quickly if there are any enemies in the vicinity you may need to self EMP if you've taken any short damage self EMP remotely and immediately pop any Shield or use armor swaps in death boxes or floor loot to pounce on your enemies quicker there's always much to learn when playing as crypto but the important tip you can take away from this video is to not stay in your drone for long periods of time the only excuse would be if your team is holding down an area or building you can use a drone to scout the area ensure you keep drone usage to a minimum especially when you're moving around the map so you can stay with your team or myself I like to keep moving and using the a few seconds of my time to check the banners and Beacon or tapping my tactical to launch the Drone for oncoming enemies that's it for this video it's been a pleasure creating these tips and tricks video and again thank you EA for sponsoring this video""]"

stick them in a coffee can and forget about them basically is what the author is saying the average time for a company to get 200 Vegas status is anywhere from 15 to 30 years typically depending on how fast their company is compounding so these are long-term investments and it's going to take you a while to figure out whether you were right or and there's really no benefit to looking at the the day-to-day of movements of the stock really you want to be following the fundamental business and making sure that it's still on track for taking all the other previous boxes and that gets us into number eight which is the final point that Christopher Mayer brings up on the hunt for hundred burgers and that is to have a really good filter now this is something that I feel like I have a very good filter in terms of keeping out the white noise and the short-termism and the stock market and that's what you've got to have so you've got to be able to ignore all the day-to-day news any time the Federal Reserve changes interest rates or this quantitative easing going on all the stuff that I mean is quite important but it's not something that's novel it's not something that we can look out 20 years and make predictions on how that might impact our companies or impact the economy and we're much better off focusing our time on individual businesses and figuring out where we expect them to go so even very major financial events can look like you know mere blips on the radar for really high quality companies if we take a business like Apple which is an example used in this book you know Apple went through the global financial crisis in 2008 if you had held shears and Apple since like the 80s for example and you were extremely wealthy by now as you very well would be if you had the head she is since that point you know if you talk to her she hold it that's how she is since that point they're not going to go ahead and say you know I would have been so much wealthier of 2008 never happened that's that's irrelevant to what the business did it's irrelevant to Apple developing the iPhone and the iPad and continuing to grow and to offering Apple services and all these different things and you know largely we've got to think of the same way we've got to focus on individual companies you know take Warren Buffett's example Warren Buffett's investment and coca-cola as an example that was a relatively quick ten burger for him he's had another since then and his head dividend payments paved that investment off multiple times over so his is more than received his money back how he's received his money back several times just from dividend payments and it's yielding something like sixty percent a year and dividends on his original purchase price now if you go and talk to Warren Buffett about that coke investment he's got one of the best filters on the planet on them they're cut if you go and talk to him about his coke investment and and you say you know what went well what went poorly the last thing he's gonna say is you know"", ""one of the most difficult parts of getting your money working for you through investment is simply figuring out where to start we live in a world where we're overwhelmed with information on a range of different topics and the investment field really is no different over the years as I've continued to learn more and more about investing I found that one of the most effective ways to get those great investment ideas into my head is simply through Reading and I've also found that there's no secret strategy to guaranteed High returns with no risk or anything like that but there is a well-beaten path that many people have taken historically that has worked very well and is likely to continue to work well moving forward so in this video I'd like to share five pieces of recommended reading from me to you that I think really cover the basics of investing very well and would certainly suit a beginner investor or potentially someone who's a little bit further along in the journey but feels that they still have a few you kind of wicker areas that I'd like to like to work on and this definitely isn't like a definitive list of must read investment books or anything like that but this is a set of materials that has really helped me personally build a strong investment framework over the past few years one that I'm very comfortable with moving forward and one that I think will serve me well probably for the rest of my life and although I focus predominantly on stock market Investments on this YouTube channel the principles really apply to all types of investing whether it be in the stock market in real estate or even in private businesses for me I've settled on more of a Warren Buffett long-term value investing approach to growing my money over time so you will see that influence throughout this list because frankly it's really the only method that's ever made sense to me rationally for making good returns over time without taking absurd levels of risk and if a personal friend of mine was really serious about getting started with investing and becoming a better investor over time this is sort of the list of five reading materials that I would Point them towards as well so if you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and perhaps even share it with a friend who you think might be interested in getting started on their investment Journey but without further Ado let's get straight into this list of top 5 reading materials for beginner investors now the first book I have is this one invested by Phil and Danielle town now if you're not familiar with Phil town he is the author of a couple of different books uh rule one and payback time I have both of those on the bookshelf behind me and this is the third book that Phil town has written this one is a little different because he actually wrote it with his daughter Danielle Danielle actually started her career as a lawyer working huge 80 100 hour plus weeks I got exceptionally burnt out and decided that she really needed to find a different path to kind of move forward in life and that was actually the emphasis for Phil and Danielle to start a podcast together where you would have Danielle who really knew absolutely nothing about investing and Phil Town who had been investing successfully for decades and had taught thousands and thousands of people over the years the basics of investing and I'm an avid listener of that podcast still to this day it's called invested they put out episodes every week and this book really summarizes the journey for Danielle and some of the key lessons that she'd learned along the way and it's written in very plain and simple language that's easy for really anyone to understand and I think it's a really nice place to start for absolute brand new beginner investors now like I mentioned I have also read Phil Town's other books rule one and payback time I think they're good but the lessons from those two books really are summarized and invested and invested also adds a little bit of new stuff on top"", ""and it only had 20 holes in it and every time you make a new investment you have to punch out one of those holes you would think long and hard about each individual investment you make and if we really want to minimize our invest results and you know basically burn our portfolio to the ground really quickly we're probably much better off trading actively you know paying high commissions all the time paying a lot of tax and reacting very emotionally uh to to market prices and the like rather than focusing on business fundamentals like I said in point number one we really want to combine those ideas of trying to predict what the market will do number one and then once we've got a good idea of what we think the market might do we want to trade as actively as we possibly can that real sort of mental Cesspool of trying to predict the market uh trading very actively and being extremely emotional uh that is just that's gold that that is exactly what you want to be doing now the third Point here for trying to get really bad investment results is uh perhaps for those that aren't quite as interested in point one and point two of uh trying to you know predict what the market will do and trade actively around that uh not all hope is lost there are other ways for us to lose money uh in our stock market Investments and the best way that I can really think of is to try and buy the poorest Quality Companies you can possibly find ideally at the highest possible prices now a great business defined by Warren Buffett is of course one that earns a high return on Capital so if we're looking for a bad business we want to focus on those that earn a low return on Capital and if you really want to push this to the limits ideally hunt out those businesses with a negative return on Capital the ones that are losing money hand over first and really don't have a lot of prospect for ever making money out into the future if we can combine that money losing ability with a lot of capital expenditures and increasing levels of debt particularly as interest rates go up that is certainly the worst possible business you can find and that's kind of part one of this particular step of Bad Business high price now to complete step 3 of bad business in high price we need to get the high price component and there's really two ways to approach this ideally you want to find a kind of a situation where both of these boxes are ticked and that is both a high absolute price and a high relative price so when I say a high absolute price this might be looking at perhaps the long-term average PE ratio on the market of 15 times and trying to find companies that trade much much higher than that absolute multiple once we've found maybe a basket of businesses in an industry that tend to have really high relative valuations uh you know why stop there we might as well pick out the one in the bunch that has the highest relative valuation so let's take all of our electric vehicle stocks for example that all tend to trade on really high multiples of sales and earnings and let's pick out the one where with the highest multiple of sales and earnings that's pretty likely to push us even more towards those very overvalued companies now my fourth tip here to minimize our investment returns in the stock market this year and and uh you know several years following that is the chase short-term winners particularly if their stock charts are just going up and to the right on an exponential basis and they look like they might be about to take off to the Moon those are really the stocks uh the hot stocks that we want to chase if the crowd is funneling towards a particular area of the market or even better a particular stock that is really the place we want to get our money in as quickly as possible if you hear your taxi or Uber driver you know mention a particular stock or a particular stock market kind of sector that is a great great place to hunt out some of these poor Investments and it really ties in well to point number three here because typically if there's a lot of people funneling uh you know money towards a particular investment often that will mean that investment has a very high price and uh we're getting kind of two birds with one stone when we do that so um chasing those hot stocks and chasing those potential short-term winners is a is a really good way to go now the final tip here to minimize our investment results is that anytime you find an absolute no-brainer investment one that's really likely to have very high investment returns moving forward the equivalent for example of someone literally handing you ten dollars and saying I will sell this to you for five uh anytime you see those really no-brainer opportunities you want to invest the smallest amount of money in that thing that you possibly can in the interest of diversifying widely now in all seriousness the diversification Point here is a little bit of a controversial one some people will certainly argue well in favor of diversification""]"

equal amount of your time building your income through businesses or through a job that's going to be higher paying so my final tip is to think about not getting a car now if you've been watching this channel for a while you'll know I kind of have a thing against cars and that's because they are so expensive and people don't realize this because they think hey I paid $4,000 for my car how can it be that expensive it's it's only $4,000 I didn't spend anything else on it that is one of the biggest mistakes you can make not only do you have depreciation you have insurance for your car you have wear and tear you have maintenance you have registration you have fees you have speeding tickets you have all these different expenses that go into cars gasoline right we have so many expenses that go into the price of cars that the average price of owning and operating a car in a year is about eighty nine hundred dollars that statistic is coming from the Bureau of Labor Statistics I literally memorize that because I say it all the time to people who ask me what's the best best suggestion you can have for me to save some money or to start to build some wealth start to think too about getting a car if you can I know most people especially in America we we need cars can we live far away from things but if there's a way just start to think about it is there a way for you to not have a car maybe that means you take the bus once a week maybe you get somebody to drop you off every now"", ""the car market has been absolutely Bonkers for the last two years used car prices for a five-year-old car is selling as much as a brand new car and brand new cars are being sold for 15 20 25 over MSRP what caused this to happen why are prices so high and why are there so few cars on dealer Lots today in this video I'm gonna do a deep dive on why things are so out of whack right now and how you should prepare first let's start with the basics why is the inventory so low on so many dealer Lots the biggest reason and it's obvious lack of delivered cars quite frankly manufacturers can't produce enough cars right now to meet demand this never ever happens with the car market but as you know the last two years have been very unusual and we are going through an unprecedented time right now now of course back in 2020 and 2021 many facts factories had to shut down due to the pandemic there were a lot of quarantine a lot of restrictions and of course a lot of manufacturing simply stopped and even in 2022 we heard of factory closures in China due to outbreaks metals like aluminum steel rubber Plastics were all very scarce as well as production stopped and even today we still have a massive chip shortage going on right now we know that modern cars are full of semiconductor chips and right now Chip producers are still trying to play catch-up many manufacturers Place huge orders over the last two years simply because they knew there would be a supply chain issue and orders wouldn't be filled those orders are still being filled by The Producers today plus you have countries like China with astronomical growth right now with their EV sector in fact"", ""hey i want to order bottle service next thing you know they bring a bottle over to your table they bring mixers in exchange for this they are charging well over a 1 000 markup on that bottle of alcohol so the average bottle service in las vegas ranges from 350 to 600 dollars you're paying over a thousand percent more for that bottle of alcohol just to drink it in front of people however let's take this a step further if you go to the hakasan nightclub in las vegas and order the armand de brignac dynasty collection you will be paying five hundred thousand dollars for bottle service i'm not kidding you just to put this in perspective it costs about thirty thousand dollars to build a school in a third world country so instead of spending half a million dollars on bottle service you could open sixteen schools in developing countries and still have twenty thousand dollars left over ordering bottle service is one thing you should never do with your money and the third and final thing you should never do with your money and this is a mistake i made myself is buying an expensive car guys i lost almost ten thousand dollars on a car over the course of one year because i made the mistake of buying an expensive car the thing is americans are obsessed with cars especially young people like myself and this is a financial trap that you need to avoid many of us see cars as a status symbol an expensive car is a temporary escape from our financial reality or a depreciating liability whichever one you want to look at in fact the average car payment in the united states is now 503 dollars per month so 49 of americans are paycheck to paycheck meanwhile the average person is spending over 500 a month to drive a car does that make any sense to you i think that many of us have lost touch with what a car actually is a car is a method of transportation here are two people who work for the same employer one person drives a ten-year-old economy car that is paid off so his car payment is zero dollars a month the other person drives a brand new luxury car and his car payment is six hundred dollars a month both people are able to get to their job at the same time because a car is a method of transportation spending six hundred dollars a month on the car does not help you earn any more money they both get to the job and they both make the same amount of money a car is a method of transportation i truly believe this is the number one problem with society we buy things we don't need with money we don't have to impress people we don't like and i don't want you guys to fall into this trap these are the three things that you should never do with your money and guys if you know somebody who is doing any of these things with their money please share this video with them and

'weekly']","[""so once you've estimated how high and how long cryptos on your list could pump in response to upcoming events and announcements the next steps are to decide how much to allocate and when to take profits it should go without saying that going all in on a crypto you think is going to pump is a very bad idea this is because there is no guarantee that the pump will play out exactly as you projected it could start earlier or later last longer or shorter go higher or even go down in response to the news you're banking on in a worst case scenario your investment could go to zero and though you've heard this about crypto before it's especially applicable in this case that's because it's safe to say that big cryptos like bitcoin are here to stay but the same can't be said for many of the altcoins you'll inevitably end up holding as part of your mission to the moon as such it's wise to put down only what you're willing to lose not only will this help minimize your losses but it will also make cashing out easier if or when the gains start to come in that's because it's really hard to take profits if you have a huge allocation and prices are going parabolic reducing your exposure will make it easier to abide by a risk-off profit-taking strategy as i mentioned in my video about my personal crypto trading strategy the irrationality of the market often means that any sort of logical analysis doesn't work when prices really start to pump that's why i personally take profits based on the percentage gains i have rather than any psychologically comfortable price points or price targets revealed by ta more importantly i tend to keep some of my coins and tokens in the race in case the rally continues this can and often does happen especially when market euphoria is at an all-time high on that note it's worth quickly pointing out that smaller altcoins don't always care about what the rest of the crypto market is doing all coins almost always follow bitcoin's lead but there have been many instances of altcoins continuing to pump even as the rest of the market carries on dumping even so it's important to be aware of what the rest of the market is doing and factor that into your measurements allocations and profit taking strategies if we're bleeding red across the board you might want to reduce the height and length of any pumps you're predicting reduce your allocations and lower your cash out expectations in the short term once you've decided how much to allocate and when to take profits for the cryptos on your pump list the last step is to consider whether any of those cryptos has some serious longer longer-term potential chances are you'll come across a couple of these during your crypto quest and you'll know you've found a winner when you see some most or all of the following features first and foremost there's a use case or utility for the coin or token that creates constant demand for it this is because the constant buying pressure should increase its price over time second the coin or token is listed on a few reputable exchanges like kucoin and binance but has yet to list on any u.s exchanges like coinbase kraken or gemini this is because most of the money flowing into crypto is coming from the united states and as regulators continue to crack down on offshore exchanges more of this capital is staying on u.s exchanges the thing to keep in mind here is that the cryptocurrency you think has long-term potential could be too similar to a security i.e a stock in a company to us regulators this means u.s cryptocurrency exchanges won't be able to list that coin or token now you can familiarize yourself with the criteria currently used to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security or not by watching my video about the ripple versus sec lawsuit in the description the third feature of a crypto with long-term potential is lots of partnerships with popular crypto projects and protocols this is because the future of cryptocurrency is interoperability and if a crypto project has made little to no effort to cooperate and integrate with its competitors it will have a hard time flourishing in the future the fourth feature of a crypto with long-term potential is lots of vc funding assuming this vc funding comes after the cryptocurrency's main net has launched already as i mentioned in my video about the most funded crypto projects this is because any investments made by vc's post main net are a strong sign that the project is legit and still has a lot of potential the fifth feature of a crypto with long-term potential is constant development and innovation this is because the crypto space is insanely competitive and a failure to evolve can be fatal for a project the last feature of a crypto with long-term potential ties into the fifth and that's the absence of any serious competition within that cryptos niche this is because a monopoly on a certain technology or use case is insanely profitable as proven by chain link which dominates cryptocurrency's oracle niche now these are just a few of the features that define a crypto project with long-term potential and you can learn about the others by watching my video on how to find promising altcoins it's up there in the top right they say you can't predict a crypto pump but recently i found that these pumps usually have many of the same characteristics this methodology can be summed up in a single sentence and that's to pay very close attention to what's going on in cryptocurrency and be honest with yourself about what you see and what it means i personally don't chase pumps mainly because i don't think it's a sustainable long-term investment strategy i prefer to stick to huddling and swing trading cryptocurrencies i believe to be legit because there's more to life than chasing pumps and crying over dumps having said that it is interesting to go digging through the lower levels of the coin market cap leaderboards every now and then and observing some of the crazy price action in those low-cap altcoins which one could be next that's my two cents for you today folks if you enjoyed the

been asking me if i could cover urgent topics in a timelier manner"", ""are you getting constantly wrecked by the crypto market if you are it might be because you've been making decisions based on bad crypto advice so today i'm going to tell you about some of the worst crypto advice you can get and what you should consider doing instead [Music] before i hit you with the facts there's a misconception i need to whack if you came here looking for financial advice i'm afraid you won't find any of that that's because entertainment and education are the only things i pack please contact a financial advisor if money is what you're trying to attract now if this is the first time you come by my name is guy and this channel is where crypto fudd comes to die that's because i create high quality crypto content that explains the who what when and why coins tokens news and reviews are just a few of the topics i supply so if this is the kind of content that gets you high subscribing to the channel and pinging that notification bell is the correct reply if you're trying to beat the clock you can use the timestamps below to hop just remember that watching until the end will help this video pop now that you know the plot let's look at the crappy crypto advice that's keeping you in a knot the first piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is a timeless classic and that's that you should buy a crypto when it's at or near its all-time high this tends to happen because you've either been led to believe that this crypto will continue to pump or because prices keep pumping while you watch and you start to feel the fomo and of course when you buy the price starts to crash and you end up at a 30 to 50 percent loss within days sometimes the loss is enough for you to sell especially if another crypto catches your eye here's what you can do instead start by assuming that if you're hearing about a crypto because it's pumping then you're already late to the game and are therefore at a high risk of getting wrecked next pop open that kryptos price on coin market cap or coin gecko set the time frame to maximum and see whether the current pump is sustainable or not if you're not sure then pull up the charts for that crypto on your favorite crypto exchange set the chart to daily and slap on the bollinger band indicator if prices are popping out the top then you're too late now you can learn more about how to spot the top using the link in the description the second piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a certain cryptocurrency because its price tag is low and that means it's going to make you rich if it gets as big as bitcoin oddly enough the cryptocurrencies that fall into this category tend to have the most militant communities and chances are that they're the ones who gave you this advice and of course when you buy the price starts to crash and it's only when your portfolio is down 50 that you realize the price tag doesn't matter so here's what you can do instead start by ignoring the price tag of cryptocurrency and focus instead on its market cap this is because it's the market cap that ultimately determines how much a crypto can pump or dump don't forget that it goes both ways next ask yourself how large this cryptocurrency's market cap could realistically grow i.e how much investment this cryptocurrency could realistically see and by when spoiler it's not going to have a bigger market cap than bitcoin or ethereum regardless of what the fanboys say if you're not sure how big a crypto will grow then check out the other crypto projects in its category and see how it stacks up against its competition primarily when it comes to social engagement and monthly active users if applicable you can learn more about crypto categories using the link in the description the third piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a certain cryptocurrency because it's being shield by someone popular such as a musician politician or an electric car company ceo what makes this advice so bad is that it can come with the illusion of legitimacy particularly when someone tells you about this crypto before it pumps and you manage to get in early eventually however the prices start to crash and maybe you double down and buy the dip once or twice before you realize that you should have gotten out a long time ago as prices approach zero here's what you can do instead start by being aware that celebrity promotion is a huge red flag since quality crypto projects do not require any marketing especially not the kind of marketing that explicitly targets inexperienced retail investors next check to see whether the crypto project being pushed actually has potential this includes stuff like a clear use case that creates demand a vesting and inflation schedule that doesn't introduce too much supply and a unique design that sets it aside from its competitors most of this information can be found in a crypto project's white paper and you can learn how to read those using the link in the description the fourth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a cryptocurrency just because it was mentioned by a popular youtuber similarly to buying a crypto because it's pumping this advice tends to be given shortly after a youtuber posts a video about the crypto project which is literally the worst time to buy and of course when you buy there is a chance others will see it as an opportunity to take profits and sell and then you blame the youtuber for your losses even though they told you time and time again that their videos are not financial advice and crypto trading bots automatically buy and sell the cryptos they're talking about when a video is posted here's what you can do instead start by realizing that you should only be using crypto youtube videos as part of your own research and remembering that youtubers don't always get everything right next check to see if the youtuber in question is getting paid to talk about certain crypto projects or holds the coin or token they're talking about as part of their personal portfolio as most of you will already know i do not do paid videos i only talk about crypto projects i personally believe in and always tell you whether the crypto i'll be talking about is part of my personal crypto portfolio at the start of every video you can see how my crypto portfolio performed in 2021 by using the link in the description and you can find out what my crypto portfolio looks like now by subscribing to my weekly newsletter also in the description the fifth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to trust the stuff you read on social media about a crypto project if you're a regular user of twitter or reddit you've probably seen no shortage of posts that make you feel fomo about certain crypto projects and make you feel fud about others sometimes these posts can be very convincing and that causes you to buy or sell a crypto at the wrong time resulting in massive losses or missed gains here's what you can do instead start by being aware that a lot of the people who aggressively spread fomo and fud on social media are either being paid or have invested so much time and money into a crypto project that their bias has gotten the best of them next do your own research to determine whether what they're saying is true or false pro tip if the information they're giving isn't publicly available or requires talking directly with a member of the team to confirm you're probably dealing with a coin you can find out what other characteristics coins tend to have by watching my video about that using the link in the description the sixth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to keep all your cryptocurrency on a custodial platform such as a cryptocurrency exchange or a crypto savings app proponents of this approach push the idea that these platforms are just as safe as self-custody and you might as well earn some interest on your idle coins and tokens when you're not trading right"", ""so once you've put together a list of cryptocurrencies that could jump the next step is to identify any upcoming events or announcements that could cause them to pump upcoming events and announcements can be divided into three categories unpredictable predictable and delayed a great example of an unpredictable announcement is avalanche's recent 230 million dollar vc funding round avax predictably pumped in response and while it would have been pretty hard to get into position before that pump happened it is actually more doable than you think typically most people don't get word of this kind of news until they see it in a headline somewhere and the headlines typically come from blog posts or tweets made by that crypto project as such an easy way to get ahead of this news is to regularly check the blogs of the projects you're following and turn on the notification bell for their twitter accounts when it comes to predictable events and announcements a good example here is the recent rollout of cardano's smart contracts on september the 12th cardano's smart contract date was announced way back in mid-august meaning there was plenty of time to prepare for the pump now the ada holders among you will remember that there wasn't much of a pump on the day cardano's smart contracts went live this is primarily because the concurrency issues revealed during cardano's smart contract testnet on september the 1st sent a signal to ada investors that dapps would not be seen immediately after the alonso hard fork i say this because september the first was when ada hit its most recent all-time high and in retrospect that would have been the best time to take profits something that die hard cardanians like me didn't see in terms of delayed events and announcements a perfect example is shiba inu's recent coinbase listing something which had initially been scheduled for june those of you who watched my shiva inu video will remember that coinbase's listing delay was due to technical errors which i found surprising because shib is an erc20 token in any case shib finally listed on coinbase earlier this month and its price pumped by 50 as a result though there was obviously no way of knowing for sure when that announcement would come any ship holders who waited patiently for the pump reaped the rewards now if you're curious about how coinbase decides to list cryptocurrencies you can watch my video about that using the link in the top right once you've identified any upcoming events or announcements that could cause the cryptos on your list to pump the next step is to try and figure out just how long the pump will last as a rule of thumb buying the rumor and selling the news is the best way to go but as you heard a few moments ago this isn't always a foolproof method and this is for many reasons for starters there is a big difference between how large cap mid cap and small cap crypto currencies behave most of the money invested in large cap cryptocurrencies comes from big investors be they individuals or institutions this so-called smart money makes calculated investment decisions by contrast most of the money in mid to small cap cryptocurrencies comes from retail investors like you and me and our investment decisions are driven mostly by our emotions what this means in the context of predicting a pump is that you need to be able to think about cryptocurrencies you hold as both a vc investor and an ape to make things easy you can separate the candidate cryptocurrencies on your list into institutional driven and retail-driven assets spoiler most cryptocurrencies will fall into the eight category in my experience institutional-driven cryptos tend to have longer more sustained pumps after bullish news this usually lasts for days or more conversely retail driven cryptos will have shorter more intense pumps after bullish news which last for two days at most in some cases ape-driven pumps can last a lot longer because of retail ape psychology and the crypto that comes to mind here is xyo network coinbase announced on september 8th that it would be listing the xyo token on september the 9th and when it listed it pumped by nearly 3x and stayed high for almost an entire week if you're wondering why take a look at the dollar values of the cryptocurrencies available on coinbase until shiba inu listed xyo network was the lowest by dollar value now an experienced investor knows that a low dollar value means nothing because it's the market cap that determines how high an asset could go this logic means nothing to retail apes who see the low dollar value as a sign that this cryptocurrency is an easy way to get rich quick and so they piled in not surprisingly xyo began to crash once shib listed simply because shibb bumped xyo out of its spot as the lowest cryptocurrency by dollar value on coinbase ape psychology remember it once you've assessed how long the cryptos on your list are likely to pump in response to upcoming events and announcements the next step is measuring how high those cryptos could go now there are many different ways you can measure this but the first thing you need to check is the market cap of that coin or token as i've mentioned many times before the lower the market cap the more room that crypto has to grow regardless of its dollar value this is because a low market cap means it takes less money to push up its price as you've just seen though the average retail investor puts a lot of weight on the sticker price of any crypto and i'm sure if you had a sat but every time your friends and family said they didn't have enough money to buy one btc you'd be richer than satoshi this brings me to the first way you can measure how high a pumping crypto could go and that's to be on the lookout for any psychologically comfortable dollar values you could encounter on the way up this includes ranges like ten cents or fifty cents or one dollar or five dollars or ten dollars fifty dollars a hundred dollars and so on now naturally this approach is better suited for ape-oriented coins and tokens because of the profit taking that's likely to take place around these levels it's safe to assume that the price could top out slightly before those key levels are reached the second way you can measure how high a pumping crypto could go is to use technical analysis specifically previous zones of support moving averages and various indicators naturally this approach is better suited for more mature cryptos i happen to have an entire video dedicated to spotting the top using technical analysis and you can find it up there in the top""]"

price dipped a little bit lower the bond price dipped our yield would have been a bit higher we could have jumped in and bought then and ultimately our returns would have been better than the 10 because we would have paid a lower price and either way we know we're getting back the 100 at the end of the day so speaking specifically to people who are looking at or investors who are looking at their portfolio and saying hey I own these different Bond ETFs and I'm buying them for safety I'm buying them for security one thing you might consider doing is perhaps not owning the ETF itself perhaps tips the treasury inflation protected securities we talked about before are a great investment but there really only as good as we're willing to hold them to maturity if we have to buy a bond and we buy the bond ETF and then things don't go the way we expected from a macroeconomic standpoint that can hurt us but if we buy a five-year Bond or a two-year Bond or a 20-year Bond and we hold it to maturity assuming in this case the U.S government can pay us back at the end of the 20 years we know today exactly what those returns are going to be if they're enough for the safety part of our portfolio that we need that could be a very good move now for me I'm more focused on stocks and longer term investing I'm trying to get bigger returns than even what today's bonds are are paying us so for me I'm trying to focus on stocks with that in mind let me tell you real quick about a website that we're building where it will be different we're going to we're building a platform that allows us to Value companies quickly and easily now we've already built the discounted cash flow version of the platform and we're gradually going to introduce a bunch of different ways to Value different types of stocks different ways that are good for different companies based on their own economic profile based on their own financials so ideally we could punch in the ticker of a company like a Tesla and it will the website will kick back some of the best ways to value that stock what the fair value is using that valuation method guiding us as to whether or not we should consider investing in it or really consider researching it more or maybe a bank discounted cash flow doesn't work for a bank but it could work but Price to Book value press the tangible Book value these could be ways that work very very well companies like apple discount cash flow would be perfect for that it's a large Blue Chip company very reliable free cash flow that could be a great way discounted cash flow is a great way to do it that's already working we got the beta version of the website up now the advantage of signing up today before the the whole website is done being built is that we are locking in the price for anybody who signs up today"", ""so the chart in the paper that's on forbes you can see the various combinations for the u.s euro and japanese 10-year maturity government bonds from the perspective of investors in all these different currencies and countries so even though every country in this list has a much lower unhedged yield than the us treasury and here i had a loan exception being italy which we'll also address in a second the hedge yields for every country's bond is higher than the yield of the u.s 10-year treasury this is an example of the carry trade at its finest and potentially at its most dangerous by taking a long-term low yielding asset and by using a derivative contract the low yield is now turned into a high yield temporarily and vice versa now the state of affairs where the u.s treasury's lower head shield than any other country is not completely an accident global central banks are easing policy pretty aggressively and as of this writing the u.s had not eased policy aggressively subsequently it has eased policy quite substantially like i commented on during that write-up and in the post-covet environment yields have indeed in the u.s been cut quite drastically now the lower policy rates in foreign countries result in carry benefits both in their internal market and also in the external market so let's get into that for a second for example in europe very negatively yielding short-term yields for example short-term meals went down to about i think negative 90 basis points result in positive carry even for a 10-year bond at negative 25 basis points for internal european buyers such as indexers or banks in europe this is because if they buy a bond at negative 0.25 then with a fixed yield curve shape the bond rolls down towards the more negative shorter term yield which results in a positive total return so even though the yield itself is negative the roll down and carry result in a positive expected return now the increasing target two deficits that's the balance of the central banks between the italian central bank and the german central bank and others are indeed a symptom of the fact that money is being recycled from italy back into german boons presumably because despite negative yields the carry and safety of being in boons is worth the risk to italian holders of euros and of italian bonds and obviously the haircut on boons is much lower so the boons can be used for repo and for other financing operations in addition by reducing short-term interest rates and the consequent application of the covered interest rate parity relationship the central banks are also encouraging unknowingly possibly the kind of speculation that has been discussed just a few minutes ago that by external buying of negatively yielding assets and converting them to positively unique assets you're allowing for external arbitrage now this state of affairs is not the first time it might sound unique but it has a very classic life cycle and it is deeply related to other forms of carry trades the currency carry trade is also very deeply related to the volatility in currencies and other asset classes and i wrote a paper in the journal of fixed income on this topic a few years ago the fact that currency volatility has remained incredibly low over the last decade has mitigated so far forced unwinds of leveraging the scary trade but the question is can it last indefinitely and currency volatility is extremely low so people think that there is no risk in currency carry trades but as we know when it unwinds it unwinds in a very rapid and uncontrolled fashion now one scenario in which currency volatility can rise sharply is a hiccup in risk assets that results in a rush into u.s fixed income assets for just protection of portfolios or due to an aggressive rate cut by the fed"", ""in this video we're going to look at the basics of a bond what it is and how you can make money investing in it we're gonna look at two real-life examples one from Nike and one from Kroger a bond is a loan you make to the company let's look at some examples here are the details for a Nike bond and here are the details for a Kroger bond we're gonna keep this simple let's imagine you're going to invest $1,000 worth of each bond here's an overview of how a typical bond would work when a bond is first issued it has on it what is called par value or face value typically that's a hundred or thousand dollars so let's imagine you invest a thousand dollars on that day in return what you will receive is interest payments usually twice a year let's assume the coupon rate on that bond is 10 percent that would mean if you invest a thousand dollars you would receive $100 a year or $50 every six months that's typically the way it works twice a year you would receive this until the maturity date were on the maturity date in addition to your final interest payment you would receive back the par value of the bond in this case a thousand dollars so in looking at the Nike bond the three point eight 75% tells you that for the thousand dollars invested you would receive thirty eight dollars and seventy five cents for the kroger bond the seven point five percent coupon tells you would receive seventy-five dollars a year if you look at the price of each the Nike bond is trading at one hundred and two point four while the kroger bond is trading at one hundred and thirty point three why the difference people have flooded into the kroger bond that is paying seven and a half percent the more people that buy it the higher the price goes so what does this mean for you as an investor the hundred and thirty point three means it would cost you one thousand three hundred and three dollars for the same thousand dollars worth of a bond while the Nike bond will cost you one thousand twenty four dollars the advantage of buying the kroger is if you pay thirteen hundred and three dollars you will receive 75 dollars a year versus the thousand twenty four dollars for Nike we are only going to receive thirty eight seventy five a year no matter what the price you pay you're going to receive the interest payments based on the par value of the bond and at the end of the bond when the bond matures you're going to receive back that par value also known as the face value that's the purpose of investing in bonds it's steady it's consistent and in theory it's safer than stocks if you have any questions about the world of investing any suggestions on videos please post in the comments below and please subscribe as we

however having all three of these components is very difficult this is also known as the big blockchain trilemma many smart contract platforms have two of these components firmly in place but are relatively weak when it comes to the third blockchains like Bitcoin and ethereum are considered to be decentralized and highly secure but aren't necessarily scalable in comparison a platform like buying Finance smart chain has issues with decentralization but is considered to be scalable and secure ethereum due to its popularity for creating dapps has experienced such difficulties with scaling that they've needed to charge higher fees to cover the expenses in return many users have chosen to invest in other platforms as the first system that's built into blockchain layer 1 can perform standard functions such as performing transactions while the following layer 1 list includes more than a dozen of the best smart contract platforms Bitcoin is still the most common layer 1 cryptocurrency layer 2 cryptos are protocols that are built directly on top of the layer 1 structure to resolve cost and speed issues two examples of layer 2 blockchains on bitcoin are the Bitcoin lightning Network and liquid Network on the ethereum side examples of layer 2 blockchains would include polygon personally I do love polygon and I've actually built two companies that are using polygon as its layer 2 solution now that you know the difference between layer 1 and layer 2 crypto it's time that you know what's the best later on projects to invest in but first go below this video

you because the reality is so vastly different than the claims being made by so many that just simply have no clue such throughput is unreachable for current blockchain networks the normal throughput of a proof of work network is usually only a few dozen transactions per second proof of stake networks can reach several hundred transactions per second distributed networks generally suffer from serious scalability limitations low throughput and excessive storage required to maintain the state of the system and its transaction history after some five years of interdisciplinary research efforts in iohk the hydra paper was released scientists and researchers from networking multi-party computation programming language and consensus branches had to work together to come up with a scaling solution that fits well with blockchain and smart contracts it is a major scientific achievement and a significant milestone in the development of cardano oroboros hydra breaks new ground and proof of stake scalability with hydra cardano can really become the alternative to current fiat money hydra is the second layer solution on top of the cardano first layer where pos consensus is used hydra is designed in a way that fits well with a stake pull model the io hk team introduced an extended utxo model that allows sharding of stake space without the need to shard the ledger itself this is significant as crypto kirby would say for you degenerates out there that fail to read or understand what some of the means it means changing the entire paradigm of crypto forever on cardano it is still possible to shard on the ledger level and hydra is a complementary part of the whole scaling solution wait till we get to the meat of this every pool can create a new hydra's head so adding more pools means that more heads can be added so by adding new heads to the protocol nearly the issues they protocols nearly linear scaling can be achieved simulations have been done and the results are great each hydra head can process around a thousand transactions per second and there is room for further optimization so with one thousand pools which we have more than that i think we have like 1600 cardano could be theoretically able to scale up to 1 million transactions per second per second compared to 150 million transactions every day we're talking about a million per second on cardano"", ""but it's been proven enough for the world's largest investment firms to start accumulating tokens and coins as far as the security of the actual tech is concerned i'll break it down it's true that some blockchain networks prioritize speed over security and there are always hackers trying to alter blockchain code to try and make more tokens the good news is that the more prominent blockchain networks have been tested by hackers because they're almost always under attack the more computers a blockchain has validating its transactions the more secure a network is a 51 attack happens when more than 50 percent of the computers in a network are hacked or controlled by a group of miners or validators with bad intentions they can prevent transactions halt payments and reverse transactions allowing coins to be double spent now we've been talking a lot about blocks and chains and other tech stuff so now is a good time to explain just what the heck a blockchain actually is at its core a blockchain is just a fancy spreadsheet in the cryptoverse we call this a ledger the ledgers are cut up into chunks or blocks and these blocks are chained together in one giant file called a blockchain the giant blockchain of spreadsheets gets authenticated and verified so there aren't any double spins or other errors this is called consensus and it's a big part of what makes crypto so special consensus means computers are validating transactions and agreeing that the information is correct the two most common ways of achieving consensus in a blockchain are what's called proof of work and proof of stake bitcoin is a proof of work blockchain where specialized computers compete to solve complex math problems and are rewarded with bitcoin we call this mining the more people competing to solve blocks the more secure the network is new miners are incentivized to join the network as the value of bitcoin increases thereby making a positive feedback loop of network security of stake blockchains like cardano avalanche and polkadot are more scalable because they don't require expensive mining equipment or energy inputs like proof-of-work think of proof-of-stake like depositing coins into the crypto equivalent of a piggy bank users can store their tokens into one big piggy bank with other people and they're called delegators the person who keeps the electronic piggy bank up and running is called a validator the token protocol has rules that randomly select validators to add transactions to the blockchain which earns rewards that are shared by everyone who has stored their tokens in that validator so because major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum have so many computers validating the network or so much hash power it is extremely unlikely that they will suffer an attack they're just too many computers or a bad actor to control networks that suffered 51 percent attacks are mostly dead projects that have fewer nodes to validate transactions we've covered what cryptocurrency is and whether it's a safe place to invest money but what gives cryptocurrency its value well value can either be innate or acquired valuables like artwork gold or any other asset have innate value because they're scarce an acquired value is something like trust in a country's government like for the dollar or the yen but ultimately it doesn't matter why people want something it only matters that enough people want it in the case of crypto limited supply of certain projects coins can make holding the asset more desirable simple supply and demand there's also the key element of what the asset can do that creates value many crypto tokens have utility that gives access to platforms they can give holders the ability to trade and create opportunities for wealth building make decentralized payments and easy peer-to-peer transactions or act as a long-term store value speculators also believe that crypto assets will increase in price over time as their utility becomes more widely used so let's break down some of the different types of cryptos starting with the most valuable bitcoin created in 2009 by anonymous developers satoshi nakamoto bitcoin is the first digital currency designed to be a form of payment that doesn't require a middle man for financial transactions the first bitcoins were mined by home computers but as bitcoin mining became more competitive and mining rewards continued to be halved every four years asic miners became a more profitable way to mine bitcoin there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places smallest unit is called a satoshi after the creator buying small amounts of bitcoin is called stacking sats and can be one of the best ways to dollar cost average into bitcoin ethereum ethereum is a decentralized software platform powered by blockchain has a native cryptocurrency ether or eth that's used to pay for transaction fees making the price rise is ethereum games adoption the ethereum blockchain can be used to create and fund decentralized applications or dapps and other secure digital technology the ethereum blockchain's community ran and home to digital money global payments and applications right now the ethereum blockchain is proof of work and ether is mined the merge to ethereum 2.0 where ethereum will become proof of stake is expected to happen sometime in the summer or fall of 2022 crypto assets other than bitcoin are known as altcoins even ethereum although i would argue that ethan has become enough of a household name that it no longer deserves the label altcoin but all coins capture around 40 of the total crypto market cap as of today there are different types of altcoins with different use cases stable coins are cryptocurrency's bank account assets that are pegged to another asset like the us dollar stable coins are used for storing funds ramping fiat to crypto exchanges and trading crypto assets circles usdc and tethers usdt are examples of secure collateralized stablecoins that are backed by company assets and reserves utility tokens are a way to pay for blockchain functionality this means that ethereum's ether is a utility token along with cardano's ada governance tokens give holders voting rights for example uni is the governance token for the ethereum-based d5 platform uniswap security tokens are digital contracts that represent fractions of a real asset like a company recording ownership or stake meme coins are tokens that get their value from community buys and not fundamentals they're driven by hype and online communities privacy coins or cryptocurrencies that can hide blockchain transactions to create an anonymity""]"

international settlements which was founded back in 1930 by the creators of the Federal Reserve this was done to ensure that their reign and their control of monetary policy globally was persistent

the bank of international settlements this is the banks piggy bank where huge amounts of wealth and power are being funneled to the wealthiest people on this planet this is the agency where shadowy

proponent by the way as well of the implementation of Central Bank digital currencies the newest and greatest Financial threat to humanity which is being cooked up by globalists and we fully programmable digital money with scary implications the outline is clear create more and more debt so the banking cartels can print more and more money this is all part of how fractional Reserve banking works is how this Fiat system works one of the most valuable Tools in A bank's Arsenal is his ability to steal money from a nation without that Nation even knowing that's inflation that's debt and it's done by compounding debt on top of debt on top of debt most economies are ruled by debt since all the money of course is being printed out of thin air the debt ends up being more just numbers on paper than actual physical ownership of tangible goods or services and then of course the fractional Reserve banking system means that only some of the money that exists in all all of the bank accounts is actually backed by physical cash that can actually be withdrawn something like a measly 10 percent in the USA thus Banks take the other 90 of your money and lend it out to anyone that they deem worthy meaning that every dollar in your bank account is not actually your money it becomes the bank's money of course it's all the bank's money anyway at the end of the day isn't it the Fiat system is a scam it's a fugazi it's a system designed to enslave everyone via debt and to impoverish everyone via inflation and all the while this criminal banking cartel manipulates the supply of money to their advantage massively enriching themselves and impoverishing everyone else Fiat money only has value because we give it value it's actually backed by nothing most people don't even realize this there's no gold backing up the dollar there's no resources backing up the dollar just a trust me bro from the government it's insanity but this era of USD Fiat dominance could be coming to an end and when it does we probably have just three choices of what comes next the first first is cbdc Central Bank digital currencies such a truly orwellian evolution of modern Fiat and criminal banking practices combined with technological totalitarianism option two the bricks money this is a proposal by the brics group Brazil Russia India China South Africa other members coming on board basically to have a commodity-backed currency backed by things like gold silver oil as well as potentially member State Fiat kind of ish a return to hard money if you will that would be a bit of a shock to the financial system if it actually grows into a global status remains to be seen but still government issued money an option three of course Bitcoin Bitcoin is the only currency of freedom

when questioned about the fact that big Banks were becoming bigger and that power was being Consolidated into even fewer hands Diamond forcefully rejected such a concern but let's kind of go over to another article and check out their point of view there is actually an existing rule preventing any Bank like JP Morgan from making an acquisition providing it with more than 10 percent of all U.S deposits JP Morgan is already above that cap so they're already above the 10 percent but Regulators waived those deposit concentration restrictions and basically blessed the deal anyways the bottom line is that diamond stepped up he cut a deal with the government he was given special privileges making him above the established regulations on banking size and now he's out working the circuit for our sake working for the government trying to calm mine and yours fears well nothing has changed in the banking sector if you understand what brought these Banks down the fact is that unrealized losses on long-term bonds purchased during a period of ultra low interest rates is basically a problem that's shared by every financial institution every single Bank in the entire world we looked at Jamie diamonds Banks and saw that they had a massive unrealized loss and there's a lot of people in the media that are trying to compare this current situation to the 2008 banking crisis and they're completely different the banking crisis from 2008 was based on sketchy high-risk Bank decisions in an ultra low regulatory environment but the problem that we're facing now is that this time the banks actually played it safe but it still backfired on them the current crisis is built on U.S treasuries which are considered very safe and long-term mortgages which are also considered relatively safe that have lost tremendous value you do to a transition from a no rate or low rate to a high rate environment the rate increases of the past year mark the first time in history that the central bank had basically tightened monetary policy while the banking system was flooded with excess cash so this is not a bridge that we've crossed before and nobody nobody in the government not Jamie dimon knows how to solve it or what the outcome is ultimately going to be and on another note a different voice in Wall Street chimed in today on the banking problems and that was Charlie Munger who I believe is actually telling the truth now he said banks are full of bad loans on commercial property he went on to say in good times we get into bad habits when the bad times come they the banks lose too much money Charlie is 99 years old man this guy's got a lot of insight and he has nothing left to gain or lose and in my view he's the one that's telling us the straight truth and I personally believe him of course the banks are in trouble the fact is the bank in Christ has actually barely started it's going to be followed by a credit crunch businesses are suddenly not going to be able to roll over their loans or borrow any money and that is going to throw the economy into Panic as everyone who owns a business is going to be scrambling to find some cash just to survive we're not talking about growing we're talking about surviving and we've also seen in retail credit it hitting new highs which is also going to feed into more of a credit crisis and that brings us back to Apple where is all the easy money going to come from that's going to push Apple stock to four trillion dollars that's the question I'm laying to you guys today I don't have the answer to that I'm needing you guys to tell me and in conclusion I've been asked a lot about two different plays I've been asked about Apple calls or buying the sqq and as I've said regarding the Apple calls the only way that you would consider buying Apple calls going into this earnings if you can sit there and you can watch it you need to be able to cut that loose immediately if it begins ends to go against you you've got to be very attentive to that particular play I personally lean towards getting into swing trades that last a little bit longer ones that I can enter and leave in a couple days a couple weeks or even a couple months you guys know I've been patiently waiting on the sqq but timing is still of essence it did reach my target which is I gave everybody when this thing was in the 30s I said guys my Buy Signal is 28 and now we've gotten to that place and I have entered a small position my purpose in entering a small position is because that allows me to put more focus and energy on that particular trade but we need to also keep in mind that Apple can push the NASDAQ higher if Apple comes out and kills it it will cause all of big Tech to go higher which would absolutely cause the sqq to break down and it could go anywhere from 28 dollars to ultimately twenty dollars and"", ""he explained that the desire to develop an alternative to bailouts increased after the financial crisis started to affect Europe in mid-2012 the international monetary fund or IMF published a paper advocating for bailins as the ideal alternative to bailouts the IMF paper had almost the same title as The Economist article by Paul and Wilson from two years earlier all the IMF needed was somewhere to test this new Balin method enter Cyprus now Cyprus was one of the European countries that was hit the hardest when the 2008 contagion spread to the continent by the end of 2012 Cyprus was on the brink of default and begging for a bailout in early 2013 the IMF and the European Union bailed Cyprus out for 10 billion euros as with all IMF loans the bailout came with multiple conditions one of the conditions was for cyprus's largest bank to execute the first ever bail in almost 50 percent of all bank account balances worth more than one hundred thousand Euros were seized a substantial proportion of these funds reportedly belonged to Russian oligarchs Cyprus was also required to take 6.9 percent of all Bank balances lower than 100 000 and 9.9 percent of all Bank balances higher than 100 000 regardless of the bank despite the social chaos and capital controls that ensued the first ever Bank Balin

include the issuance of bail in bonds which should be sold to Pension funds newsflash this means your pension money could be used to bail out Banks too the United States was the first to legalize bailins in 2010 with the aforementioned Dodd-Frank Act the UK followed suit in 2013 with the financial services act the EU legalized bailins in 2016 with the bank recovery and resolution directive so

specifics of Bank Balin laws tend to vary from country to Country unfortunately I don't have the time to get into the details about each one here however all these bailing laws seem to follow the same three rules likely because of their Collective Conformity with the FSB the first rule is that bank balines are only allowed for banks that are deemed to be domestically or globally important it's not entirely clear which banks fall into the domestically important category but it's safe to assume that this rule pertains to those with the most assets under management as for globally important Banks the FSB publishes a list of them every year along with their de facto risk of default due to derivatives debt there are currently 30 globally systemically important banks with JP Morgan being noted as the highest risk JB Morgan reportedly has 60 to 70 trillion dollars of derivatives dead if you're wondering what happens when a non-systemically important Bank goes under the answer seems to be that they get to be acquired by a domestically or globally important Bank if that wasn't wild enough Regulators are trying to apply these laws to crypto exchanges more on that in a moment now the second rule of bank balins is that they do not apply to bank balances below the deposit Insurance threshold in the U.S the FDIC covers 250 000 of deposits in the UK the fscs covers 85 000 pounds and in the

recall his stance on BuyBacks from his 1984 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders which read when companies with outstanding businesses and comfortable Financial positions find their shares selling far below intrinsic value in the marketplace no alternative action can benefit shareholders as surely as repurchases into quote key phrase for BuyBacks here is intrinsic value if you're an overconfident CEO buying back overvalued shares then you're destroying value in such a case an objection to including BuyBacks would be valid BuyBacks would indeed be a detriment to Total return but when a wise CEO buys back shares at great valuations that are below intrinsic value to paraphrase Buffett's quote no alternative action benefits shareholders as surely as repurchases one other key point about this did you notice I said net BuyBacks before we don't want to include companies that are buying back stock while also diluting their Share account for various reasons so we're sure to look at the end result and remove those companies now when we combine dividend yields with these net buyback yields we get a clear picture of a total return to shareholders again I'll point you to our white papers on this which we link to in the show notes so you can read all the details but now early in the podcast we talked about Loft evaluations one of the basic tenets of investing is that all things being equal the less you pay for an investment the better your future returns should be by that logic the better the value at which we can purchase quality assets the better position we should be for the potential of increased returns going forward due to valuation factors we'll discuss today we believe syld as well as its sister ETFs and our ylds suite are poised for strong performance going forward"", ""but Dividends are a lot more predictable for the most part you know you're going to get the exact same dividend payment and the exact same amount whether the stock price trades for twenty dollars or forty dollars and for someone expecting consistent cash flow that helps smooth out the fluctuations in the market second dividend payments are also a lot less volatile than stock prices for example the SimpliSafe dividends blog pointed out that from 1900 through 2018 dividend payments remain fairly constant with an average variance of plus or minus 10 during Market downturns when you compare that to something like the S&P500 you'll quickly see that there's a lot more volatility and for someone expecting consistent cash flow that goes a long way it also helps that dividend companies tend to be a lot larger more mature and prioritize stability so you'd be holding on to companies who've been around a lot longer than Peloton third throughout recessions dividend payments could sometimes increase as a Simply Safe dividends blog pointed out in three of the above recessions dividends paid to investors actually increased including a 46 jump during the first recession following World War II you know even though such an increase doesn't happen every time the average dividend cut is just a mere 0.5 percent compared to the stock market's average decline of 32 percent fourth dividend stocks have also been shown to provide a comparable return to that of the overall Mark in fact Fidelity found that dividends accounted for 54 of market returns during times when inflation was above five percent which means even though they're not the stocks that go up the most during a bull market they also don't decline the most during a crash and fifth depending on your tax bracket dividends could be taxed at a much lower rate for instance if you receive What's called the qualified dividend you'll have to pay no tax on that profit whatsoever if you're single making under forty one thousand dollars a year or married making less than eighty three thousand dollars a year even above that amount certain dividends will be taxed as a long-term capital gain switch significantly less than what you'd have to pay as ordinary income"", ""see I'm like buying a stock and only being taxed when you sell Dividends are taxed the moment you receive them and depending on your tax bracket that could be a price of 20 or more not to mention in a way Dividends are even taxed twice once the corporate level is profit and then once again when you receive them so they're not exactly the most tax efficient and fourth dividends could flat out be Irrelevant in this case two well-known economists argued that if an investor needs the money all they really need to do is sell the stock and that dividends don't actually create any more value for the company itself it would be kind of like saying instead of getting paid a two percent dividend the stock price would just go up by an extra two percent whereas in both scenarios your value stays the exact same although in the big picture I do think that there are some major advantages for anyone looking to replace their income with this strategy so as far as how to do this as well as my own portfolio here's what you need to know although before we go into that when it comes to investing it's important to have as much information at your disposal as possible even for myself I'll spend hours combing through the most obscure reports just to find a few new details to take into consideration that's why it's crucial that you use a platform that gives you access to all the tools and information that you need to make informed investment decisions like our sponsorepublic.com for those unaware public is the only

feel free to check out all of the details down below and now with that said let's get back to the video all right now in terms of my own dividend portion of my own portfolio I currently receive almost ten thousand dollars a month through five main sources the first and largest is from a broad U.S Market ETF schb with the dividend yield of 1.56 percent this encompasses 2500 of the largest publicly traded us companies with slightly more exposure to smaller stocks than the S&P500 although not by much since both are weighted by market cap which means that the largest companies still make up the bulk of this investment but when you have over 3.8 million dollars invested here that's a dividend yield of about five thousand dollars a month second in addition to that I also have an international Equity ETF schf with a dividend yield of 2.65 percent for those of aware this fund includes large and mid-cap stocks from developed countries outside of the United States including Nestle's Samsung shell and Toyota along with about a hundred others I personally use this as a way to get diversification outside of the United States and since I have almost a million dollars invested here that brings in an additional two thousand dollars a month third in addition to that I also have a variety of individual stocks that I hold on the side to satisfy my need to feel like I could somehow beat the market that brings my total to about ninety four hundred dollars in dividends every single month or about a hundred and twelve thousand dollars a year regardless of what happens to the stock market but as far as how much you need to live entirely off the dividends here's the entire calculation to begin it all comes down to how much do you need after all the person living in a luxury high-rise Penthouse in New York City is going to live a much different lifestyle than someone who prefers to live off the grid in a tiny home in Montana so it would depend on what your expenses are but since the average retiree spends 50 thousand dollars a year we'll go with that as our Baseline the second when it comes to dividends you don't necessarily want to go for the stock that just pays the highest yield after all you want consistency and that's what brings us to the Holy Grail of passive income dividend Aristocrats""]"

28,27,77,27_chart_line_macd_bitcoin,"['chart', 'line', 'macd', 'bitcoin', 'resistance', 'trend', 'trend line', 'moving', 'daily', 'moving average']","[""all right so let's go ahead and kick off the analysis here for bitcoin now when we take a look here at the price action we've got we've got your typical ascending triangle here you've got consistent resistance and price or at least a generally similar range where price was closing for the highs here and outside of that we've also got higher lows on the chart and this allowed us to have that ability for price to coil up and get the breakout in order to send bitcoin's price higher having some of the highest buy side candle days since as far back as june 19th and over a month's were the price action and this is exactly what we weren't able to do back during the may consolidation period and there's a big reason for this if we dive in to that four hour time frame we talked about look at what bitcoin did here it came up and took previous resistance and made it new support allowing price to start moving higher if we look back at the past we can see that the 200 ema used to serve as resistance for bitcoin's price alongside the standard 200 moving average and now we've been able as we've talked about for weeks now to finally be able to turn this into support and confirm a bullish confirmation that the bulls are back in charge and that higher lows and higher highs are likely in the cards meaning we've got an uptrend so how far could we really go here i want to go ahead and set realistic expectations while we also love watching the 200 ema and the 200 ma on the four hour time frame as i think it's one of the more significant time frames for traders who are looking into multi-week or multi-month swing trades you know on these relief rallies or buying dips in the market i think that it's also imperative to watch the daily time frame because we can also see how since the start of this correction here this has been a range where we've wanted to see whether or not price could turn it into support or if it continued to act as resistance and notice how when we look at the chart that the 200 ema and the 200 ma tend to be this range where price plays tango essentially it consolidates it pushes sideways we can see it here as well before the continued breakout higher"", ""so this is short-term news and we have to be mindful of the fact that what's next week headlines going to be like and how does that play into the resistance that is ahead for Bitcoin if Bitcoin even gets to the resistance area so these are things that I'm considering it's nice to see potential good news on the short term but remember what's happening on the long term and remember what is in play this is my Approach and this is kind of how I'm looking at the charts so here's the six hour you get a sense of it we know what has happened on and we're going to talk about resistance in just a minute we know what has happened on uh this symmetrical triangle Bitcoin broke to the downside and it's just been resistance at the lower trend line since right and even then we just put in a short-term kind of double bottom from this bottom back here on the short term six hour and this is like a couple of weeks ago so Bitcoin bouncing out of that short-term area you can see even on this very short term chart there's this momentum swing to the upside we have even on the RSI this kind of resistance line a ton of resistance on the six hour on the daily and this is what it looks like on the daily because this is more major resistance 20-day moving average the obvious one right Bitcoin fell below it all the way back here and this was right when the 20 day was breaking below the 50-day that blue line and you can just see Bitcoin fell below it it had resistance at the lower trend line of the symmetrical triangle and it had resistance confluent resistance at the 20-day moving average that 20-day moving average could continue to be lower high resistance Bitcoin keeps falling that's that first confirmation area can Bitcoin even break above the 20-day moving average it's the first thing we want to see but there's all this convergence happening with this consolidation for Bitcoin so 20-day moving average around 27 000 the lower trend line of the symmetrical triangle"", ""now you can start adding indicators for more context starting with ema you can see that the 100-day ema is a strong zone of support and it's worth pointing out that it has been a strong zone of support during previous bull markets as well adding the bollinger band indicator reveals that we are almost outside the volatility cloud now as a rule of thumb buying when prices fall below the cloud and selling when they poke above it is usually a safe bet the next indicator to check is the relative strength index or rsi this will show you whether bitcoin is overbought or underbought as you can see bitcoin has recently had a habit of falling down to the underbought level before spiking up this happened again after the recent dip which saw the rsi drop all the way down to just 13 points when you combine the ema bollinger bands and rsi you should get a clear picture of whether you're at the bottom of the dip in the short term in this case the bottom of the dip was on the 24th of april because that is when the price closed at the 100-day ema fell below the bollinger band volatility cloud and fell low on the rsi indicator now for the real question is the dip really over well there are two ways you can check this first enable the macd indicator and see if it suggests a trend reversal specifically you're looking to see if that wave of red bars is starting to shrink back to the midline this seems to be happening here the second way you can check if a dip is over is by analyzing trading volume what you're looking for is a gradual decline in cell volume and a gradual increase in buying volume the caveat here is that you must remember that a lot of the cell volume you're seeing is coming from liquidations from over leveraged longs cancelling out that noise seems to suggest that cell volume is on the decline but in this case it is not entirely clear even after accommodating for liquidations however every other indicator seems to be suggesting that the bottom of this dip is in and that bitcoin will be trading sideways or gradually moving upwards over the next few days in both cases you should keep your eyes peeled on that bitcoin dominance because it will confirm whether the crypto market is feeling bullish enough to move back into altcoins if the market dips again then you'll know what zones to watch for and you'll be able to calculate how low your alts could go in those scenarios by multiplying bitcoin's percentage drop by 1.5 x to 2x if you're wondering where prices are headed to next after a dip is done you can follow the steps i detailed in my previous video on technical analysis and it is in the usual spot as much as people talk about buying the dip it's something that's seldom done and i think that's for two reasons first buying the dip can be a very scary thing there's no way of knowing for certain if it's a correction or a crash mainly because the factors behind each dip are often hard to pin down however i'm of the belief that people fear what they don't understand and the dip isn't any different with enough context from the media and the charts chances are you'll get a pretty clear picture of where the market is headed in the short term medium term and long term the second deterrent to buying the dip is a lack of cash on hand now i blame this on the fact that too many crypto traders forget to take profits when the market is moving upwards the whole point of doing this is to make sure that you have the fiat firepower to buy the dip when it inevitably comes similarly fishing for the bottom of the dip is often a futile endeavor keeping track of the next possible zones of support is critical because you might encounter more than one dip in the medium term after all nothing goes up forever and corrections are to be expected from time to time now these can really suck but they are necessary for bitcoin and altcoins to reach their full potential during this bull run dips shake out the weak hands and the greedy traders who would cause a serious crash if left unchecked the hodlers are traders that remain with a long-term vision the growing minority of people who know that the current financial system is on the cusp of a serious transformation so whenever the dip gets you down keep this bigger picture in mind there's no guarantee you'll get rich from crypto even if you do buy the dip""]"

good month where i made like ten percent on a ten thousand dollar account and i would take that thousand dollars that i made and go spend it on something that i wanted i wasn't in the right mindset of growing my account as fast as possible and once we become profitable traders our next mission should be to grow our account as fast as possible for us to be able to quit our day job and start trading for a living which i imagine is your goal i know that was my goal whenever i first started so number two is definitely do not withdraw your money what about number three this is going to sound crazy but add to your account you want to constantly be adding to your account at the beginning when you first become profitable because that's just going to help you get to your goal account size much much faster so adding to your account is obviously a great way to get there and obviously a great way to decrease the amount of time it takes to get to that goal number in your account so you can quit your day job and start trading for a living now what i want to do is take a look at two example traders one who is making the mistake of quitting his day job withdrawing his money and not adding to his account and the other doing the opposite and taking all of these steps in order to increase his account size as fast as possible and we're going to take a look at the comparison of the two returns so on the screen you can see that we have trader a on the left and trader b on the right we're gonna assume that they both have the same exact situation they both have a starting balance of ten thousand dollars they both have a job where they make four thousand dollars their expenses are three thousand we're just using very generalized numbers here and that means that their extra that they have left over at the end of every month is about a thousand dollars and their average return is 10 per month this is the same across the board for trader a and for trader b and the reason i picked most of these numbers is because 50 000 a year is an average income for america 4k a month is around that price around that amount and then 3k a month is average expenses in america so that leaves most people with an extra about thousand dollars at the end of every month if they're budgeting correctly so with this being the case let's take a look at trader a year one trader a takes this ten thousand dollar account turns it to 12 k or gets a 12k return turning his account into a 22k account now he withdraws every month all of his profits so after his first year we're going into year two so trader a quit his day job which means he's having to use all of his trading money which means he's having to withdraw all the money which also means he has no money to add to the trading account so at the end of the year one even though he came out very profitable making a 12k profit he now has to restart with 10 000 what do you think happens in year number two the same exact thing"", ""and it's pretty mind-blowing in terms of just how much money this generates in fact some states even earn more revenue from the lottery than they do from corporate income taxes and after everybody is paid out you'll receive on average just 31 cents worth of winnings for every one dollar that you spend but even with all of that said let's assume for a moment that you defy the odds and you win how could you avoid all of these issues the first thing that you should do is tell nobody don't post about it online don't tell your friends and don't brag about it to your family if you do there's a strong chance that you'll be targeted for theft extortion or random requests from people that you wouldn't want to hear from second get an attorney even though Most states require that you publicly claim your prize you could take the safer option by setting up a blind trust held within a trust to remain anonymous this way nobody has to know that you're the next billionaire third take the lump sum like I mentioned mathematically you'll end up with a lot more money over 30 years if you invest it than if you take the annuity on top of that tax laws are likely to change over the next few decades so it's a lot safer to take the guaranteed tax upfront than risk rates going up in the future and finally four Earth do absolutely nothing for the first year even though it might be really tempting to go and quit

it's best to calmly and rationally approach the situation with a level-headed perspective with professionals who know what they're doing and the more time you have to set that up in advance the better but in terms of investing the money here's where the fun begins and this is your chance to become one of the richest people in the world with just a few steps well like I said assuming you took the lump sum and ended up with 528 million dollars after tax here's how you could distribute it first I would put 150 million dollars in a low fee total stock market index funds like VT sacks this gives you exposure to the entire U.S stock market and assuming you spend just three percent of it annually you'll be able to get 375 000 every single month without ever running out of the principal second I would put another 150 million dollars in a low fee bond market index fund like vivitalix this would give you a fairly safe and stable investment with a lot less volatility than stocks and as of now their bond funds are offering a 4.1 yield in your money assuming we did the same thing as above and only spent three percent of it that's another 375 thousand dollars every single month without running out"", ""so if you took a thousand dollars and it's set we took a few days off work a week and use that sort of money to supplement the income you would have been receiving now spend that time learning a skill like coding so that eventually you can transition into a coding job or computer science job without a four-year degree well now all of a sudden you might have $50,000 a year one to invest which if you just had a 10% return on that that's five grand or ten times as much as you getting a 50% return on a thousand dollars so spending some time maybe using money and taking time to learn something like coding could be an incredible way to invest number three consider getting a professional license in something like becoming a real estate agent which I am I'm also real estate broker but you don't have to start being a broker just become a real estate agent consider becoming a licensed a lender that's getting your nmls license great way to be a mortgage broker how people do loans you could become a licensed contractor you could also become a certified financial planner or you could become a licensed drone a pilot now out of those five professional licenses I've had four of them and I'll tell you with a thousand dollars you can get pretty far if not all of the way towards getting your license and guess what you're doing now you're starting a career in a much more profitable industry than working for minimum wage so investing a thousand dollars in a professional license could be a great way to go a little bit of detail on some of these if you want to be a real estate agent think about traveling to clients homes and different properties and you kind of have a different scenery every day but you're working with people and solving their problems if you prefer to be in an office in solving people's problems of working with people maybe being a certified financial planner or a loan officer mortgage broker would be a great idea for you if you're a handy person maybe consider actually getting your license and now instead of working for $25 an hour or $20 an hour as a handyman you can start working for forty to seventy dollars an hour as a licensed contractor and if you're into photography and sort of working on your own being a drone pilot a licensed drone pilot will unlock a lot of commercial opportunities for you so consider becoming a certified FAA drone pilot number four look you've probably heard this in every single what to do with a thousand dollar video before but it is something that is truly empowering and I'm gonna take it to the next level you should really invest in yourself and the best way in my opinion to do that is if you have a special niche that you really want to focus in on find a high quality course to help you you don't have to buy my course you can find a high quality course somewhere else find a high quality course to get into and the next like my next most favorite thing to do is when I go on jogs or runs or whatever workout at the gym which sadly is somewhat I I love listening to audiobooks you can check out my Amazon link in the description below that'll show you all the books that I love listening to or have listened to reading is a little bit tougher for me it takes a lot more time I do try to do that in the morning so obviously buying regular books is great as well but audiobooks I'll tell you there is something to just having it playing while you're on a run and your mind is just soaking up the information on business or finance or psychology some of my favorite topics obviously you could educate yourself anything you'd like coding boot camps app development wherever you want to go business dev to to fund your matter poor business you know you could spend a thousand

quarter earnings for the fiscal year of 2022 where announced a record revenue figure of 83 billion dollars up two percent year over year and a quarterly earnings per dilute share of one dollar twenty cents this insane profit margin and the fact that apple is still breaking its own records just shows how dominant this tech company has become if we take a look at the tech giant's consolidated financial statement we see just growth across the board apple isn't here to stay it's here to dominate and thrive and for me the biggest thing to be excited for isn't just how much more money the company made it's about how much the company has grown when it comes to subscriptions during the same earnings call apple reported that it had over 860 million subscriptions across all of its services a year over year increase of 160 million this is where the real growth lies because these 860 million subscriptions will provide a steady but enormous source of revenue over time for the tech company and these subscriptions can be leveraged into other services that the company offers everyone sees this warren buffett arguably the most successful and profitable investor in the country has made the

durability reliability reputation and ubiquity"", ""well i'm glad you asked hypothetical impatient viewer any ios users in the crowd might recall that bloomberg reported that apple will be rolling out a subscription service for iphones later this year or early next year to be clear this upcoming subscription service is not at all like apple's existing subscription services that's because it applies to hardware not software the subscription service will be for the physical phone itself as louis rossman pointed out in his video reaction to the news a service is when someone or something does something for you a phone is not a service it is a product and it should be entirely yours from the moment you purchase it louis also highlighted the fact that many wall street investors are pushing for publicly traded companies to adopt this so-called hardware-as-a-service business model because it will make them trade at higher valuations regardless of their actual earnings something that's mentioned in the bloomberg article trading at higher valuations regardless of actual earnings sounds eerily similar to the esg investment trend which effectively consists of asset managers moving their money into companies that comply with their ever-changing criteria causing their stocks to pump even though no actual profits are being made while i couldn't find any concrete evidence that esg investors are behind this accelerating trend towards hardware as a service in various sectors it wouldn't be surprising given that the trend is inherently esg friendly hardware as a service satisfies environmental criteria because the number of devices in circulation can be reduced the devices in circulation can be reused and any old devices can be easily recycled as you'll likely need to give back your old device to get a newer version hardware as a service also satisfies social criteria because everyone will have subscription services for the same devices there will be no phone with a better camera or a bigger memory nor a faster or slower or bigger or smaller car and that means everyone will be truly equal hardware as a service satisfies governance criteria because it will put the company producing the product in total control of its creation use and destruction anyways more about esg in the description now unlike most other esg related policies hardware as a service could actually result in actual profits because people will be paying subscription services for just about everything they own until they die notably the subscription costs could be made low enough so that these products are available to more people not just the privileged few in developing countries where most of the demand for these products is currently coming from whereas planned obsolescence was introduced as a means of solving the great depression it looks like hardware as a service is being introduced to prevent another depression from occurring by ensuring consumption continues to increase

tends to result in an equal or greater amount of pushback because hey people know something is up when they don't have a choice in the matter"", ""this means that Apple stock trades out just about normal volatility and right now they have a current p/e ratio of twenty three point five three their earnings per share is actually quite a bit higher than it should be and this is because Apple loves to buy back its own stock the dividend yield for Apple is currently at one point one three percent based on its current valuation if we take a look at the six-month chart you can see that it hits high at the start of 2020 and then dip down to the low 200s in mid-march since then it's recovered back to about 90 percent of its all-time highs not that Apple has been its expected earnings for at least the last four quarters but you can also see that they did not issue any guidance for q2 of 2020 due to the uncertain markets and in 2019 they had revenue of about 260 billion dollars with profits of around 55 billion dollars let's talk about some of the news right now and later on I'll go into a more in-depth analysis so with the up and coming 5g Network Apple is supposedly pushing back its newest iPhone 12 by about one month this means that we should expect these new phones by October in terms of growth apples services revenue is up 17% to thirteen point three five billion dollars for the March quarter and their wearables and accessories division also gained about twenty two point five percent to six point two eight billion dollars in the same quarter now going back to why Warren Buffett loves Apple so much he actually normally does not like tech companies at all it's a sector that he doesn't really understand but he likes the view Apple as a consumer product company he says that he believes Apple is the best business in the world and would love to own the entire company if it were possible he loves the customer loyalty expanding services high profit margins and extremely strong balance sheet speaking of balance sheet let's do a quick but deeper analysis at this company's financials so Apple's current enterprise value is one point two nine trillion dollars right now this is just about where the market cap is and we talked about how Warren Buffett likes buying companies when they are currently under the enterprise value so right now it is a toss-up whether or not he would currently invest in Apple's also take a look at its forward p/e ratio of twenty four point two seven this means that its current share price is twenty four point two seven times the expected earnings per share""]"

investor sentiment which is one of the biggest precursors to a bear or a bull market so investor or Market sentiment is the overall feeling of the market and as we will discuss later on the market is controlled by the emotions of fear and greed I know a lot of people try to over complicate the stock market they try to make it all about numbers and figures and uh the truth is guys the stock market is controlled by two things that is the fear and the greed and I want you guys to commit that to memory these go hand in hand with supply and demand which we're going to talk about in a little bit but the majority of the market is simply controlled by fear and greed now following investor confidence or fear indicated by a sell-off that will indicate a bear Market maybe on the horizon so when investors lose confidence in the market they become fearful a lot of them begin to sell off and that sell-off can really push us into a bear market now the interesting thing is that a lot of people do things because they are afraid of a bear market so something happens maybe there's something going going on in the geopolitical climate maybe there's something going on that they're worried about for example a lot of people had concerns When Donald Trump was elected president and uh so as a result if people are fearful enough and there is enough sell-off pressure um this sell-off in fear of a bear Market can actually trigger that bear market and turn those expectations into a reality so oftentimes people being afraid of a bear market and taking actions that actually causes the bear Market itself which is very interesting so there are actually a couple different stages of the bear market so here are the four stages of a bear market so number one we are at a period where prices are high there's bullish sentiments so people are expecting stock prices to go higher we're in a bull market and many investors begin to take profits so this is a point where a lot of beginner investors are getting in because that's the point when you're starting to realize that markets are a little bit high prices are a little high and when stupid money is being made when you see beginners getting into the stock market and making money um that's not to say you guys won't have luck with it"", ""well you're probably not going to have a good time if you are someone that needs the market to consistently go down you're probably not going to have a good time either and the big money knows this and that's why you're seeing so much cycling in it's cycling in because they know that right now is an opportunity to make a ton of money and then dump on everybody once this Market uptrend stops but the money is to be made on the upswings and then when the bear Market cycle comes back in shorting that that's how the fund managers play this and that's what is really driving the market at the end of the day they believe in the trend trade and they believe that you're going to see an on and off switch from the FED for the coming years they believe that inflation may not be going away they believe it's going to be pretty elevated for a while moving on we've got some new red flags from the trucking

around but right now yikes today's narrow Market leadership and macro environment display Hallmarks of a bull trap this means when things look bullish but they're going to go down echoing iconic Market tops of 2000 1973 and 1929 we are at the same levels that we were at those times when they were iconic Market tops could we be at a market top maybe but also look at times where we didn't have iconic Market tops when we're at the same levels so could this be deceiving certainly could Bitcoin right now showing evidence of leaving a bear Market we have a big point bull market approaching shared with shared the average sentiment oscillator past October in joining you to monitor the red line it started to decline months ago signaling the end of the bear Market once it crosses the blue line bull market will officially start you can see that as these crosses started that was historically strong bull market territory so we're not at strong bull market territory but we're definitely at declining bear transition to Bull market right now we have a very significant cross the 50 100 SMA bullish crossover just happened on the Bitcoin three-day chart Bitcoin has a long and high way to go you can see the last time this happened was October of 2015 and then look at this Bitcoin went from 290 dollars all the way up to twenty thousand dollars that's a lot of x's in there right now we have that cross once again suggesting we could see Bitcoin going up quite High potentially to the hundreds of thousands of dollars we have right now a diamond consolidation pattern for Bitcoin it's the other half of this wedge that we were talking about right here on the flip side well look out for any breakouts from a consolidation after a strong momentum uptrend on a Bitcoin chart nothing can stop the continuation Trend after the breakouts we had a strong uptrend here in 2020 Diamond consolidation pattern and then break out to strong uptrend this went from roughly 6 18 000 to 40 000 plus the next leg up we've had this strong uptrend leading into the diamond consolidation should we break out of here again by April 13th less than a week from now this could send Bitcoin roughly to those same levels forty to fifty thousand dollars from where we are right now so that's looking very very strong for Bitcoin not only that but this Sunday marks a historic Bitcoin bull market starting point for

remaining and what am i kind of getting for my 5.50 and what he found was that in his view curate slash qvc was trading at about only three or four years worth of free cash flow so a very very cheap stock assuming the business didn't just deteriorate rapidly over the next few years so in his words he really only had to be right for three years and that was a bit that he was comfortable making with a large chunk of his portfolio and that too for me has always been one of the attractions to sort of the deep value style of investment so uh looking at these weird little beat up companies trading at very low pml multiples um is the fact that you can sometimes buy some of these things for three or four or five times earnings and uh assuming that the earnings aren't going to fall off a cliff and that frankly is the sole job of you as an investment analyst to try and figure out whether you think that's going to happen if you're investing in one of these companies um if you can get yourself into a situation where the multiples are cheap you think that's probably not going to happen in terms of this big drop off in earnings uh you can bet really big because you only have to be right for a short period of time because you're getting your money back in three or four or five years if it's trading at that sort of multiple and when you sort of compare that to uh some of the more high growth stocks that are trading at very high multiples um that is a situation where you have to really be right for a longer period of time so if you go and buy a company trading at 30 times earnings you have to be right for maybe 15 or 20 years assuming that it continues to grow if you're not right and it never grows you're going to get your money back in about 30 years time which is a pretty uh anemic return and you would certainly have hopefully been better off investing in an index at that point so you really have to be confident about the ability for that business to grow and you have to be confident about the ability for that business to grow for a long time so you have to be right for 5 10 15 maybe 20 years if you're investing in one of these really high multiple companies and that's not to say investing in those things doesn't work they can clearly work very very well it's just kind of a different bet to invest in a low multiple business where you're going to get a lot of capital back very very quickly so that's really my view on portfolio allocations i'm willing to bet maybe up to about 20 of the portfolio roughly in one particular stock but it really has to take a lot of boxes and i'm willing to size as low as maybe about five percent"", ""he has outperformed the stock market by almost 10 percent since 1965 to 2023 and that's why people affectionately call him the Oracle of Omaha he's kind of like the grandfatherly investor figure that we all wish we had and him and his partner Charlie Munger created a company called Berkshire Hathaway it's a massive corporation that invests into high quality companies companies like American Express Bank of America Kraft Heinz Coca-Cola and many others and today that company is the sixth most valuable company in the world with over 7 100 billion dollars in market cap and it also has the single most valuable stock in the world each share of Berkshire Hathaway is valued at almost half a million dollars basically like flexing with a reshard mill on your wrist but in stock form now some people also like to call Warren Buffett the king of passive income or the king of dividend investing because the companies he likes to buy tend to pay him dividends so many dividends in fact that just for context in 2022 the CEO of Apple Tim Cook made about a hundred million dollars for the entire year in compensation Berkshire Hathaway by comparison made 500 million dollars per month so Warren's company Berkshire Hathaway paid out in dividends five times in a single month with the CEO of Apple made throughout the entire year which is kind of insane to think about but also not a super fair comparison because Warren Buffett doesn't own a hundred percent of Berkshire Hathaway he owns about 15 so he made only 900 million dollars but still the point is he he's really smart and anytime he speaks people tend to listen and just this weekend they held Berkshire Hathaway's 59th annual shareholder

finally or at least they have now updated part of their roadmap trying to talk about what exactly is going to be going on as they go further into the project they say that our next major step in the roadmap is to go live with our beta testing on maintenance they should have been in the early part of quarter two which is where we are now and we'll be announcing further information on how this testing will take place over the next few weeks across our various social channels based on the success of this test period will be we will be aiming to go live with our first operator by the close of

release of more original funfair slots games and updates to existing offerings if you have not checked their website they have a an area we can pretty much check and see the things that they plan on launching they said that they're not finalized yet but they wanted to give people an idea of what type of platform and what type of games they were going to have through funfair throughout quarter 2 and beyond our team will continue to represent the company at a number of international events on the gaming calendar where the trips to g2e Asia and a disruptive online gaming conference in London

bit after mainstream Financial Analysts might be fixated on Bitcoin so called death cross which apparently Bitcoin cross earlier I don't know if you guys have pretty sure a lot of you have been looking at other people's cryptocurrency videos a lot of people have been showing this thing on a graph that Bitcoin was going to cross or pass the death cross it was an indicator that there was gonna

that hedge funds and other institutions are beginning to see crypto assets as a huge opportunity and that all hell will break loose once they begin investing in the non-sentient markets I talked to hedge funds high net worth individuals even commodity speculators they look at the volatility in the crypto markets and they see this as a huge opportunity once that happens all hell will break loose II said once the floodgates are opened they're opened there are a lot of if you look at I know they're not that easy to find but I look at these things kind of all day if I have nothing to do I'm always into watching things about crypto there are a lot of really rich people and they say that the number one reason that they're actually into crypto is because of the volatility you would expect that they would be staying away because you know the prices go up and down these people know how to work the markets they have people who work for them who know how to work the markets and they're making a tremendous amount of money day trading and using BOTS to trade because of the volatility in the market you may think that people are losing money when when prices go down and they are not because they have people and BOTS like I said before who know exactly what they're doing and how to play the market so that they get money even as the market goes down he says the institution of interest is already starting to tick up in Japan which he said is a leading indicator of what will soon happen in the West regardless of retail interest which has seen a sharp decline in recent months there really is a zero large scale there really is ZERO large scale institution to money from the West and crypto right now this is already happening Japan once a large sizable chunk of Western institution and money starts to come in watch out this is probably going to happen once we get all the regulations in place Japan and South Korea and I may be one or two other places they know or have been told by their governments what these coins are what is this what is that their SEC has already jumped in and said what is going to be what it's pretty much down to Europe and the us who are pretty much saying that they will tell everybody sometime around June what all these things are not sure how many of you have been with me in this channel for a very long time this is what I was talking about before we there is no there's no rich money in the market yet everything that has kind of flown in has come from normal investors that's you and me and other people who are just trying to make an extra buck on the side once we have billionaires actually dumping their money into this this will not happen until they have proper framework for exactly what's going on like I've said

USD we have a lot of currencies that are trying to peg themselves to one to one to the US dollar or try to become the next popular stable coin so the USD X which is the I believe the third and the newest one that we have was created to combine the quantitative theory of money with proof of stake mining all of this algorithms data is gathered from a delegated decentralized data source also known as an Oracle and the Schilling point mechanism which has been referenced by vitalii buter and in the past it is an interesting mix of information sources which will certainly have an effect on the perceived stability of USD X moving forward there's a lot of controversy around people who are creating these coins because especially with tether they we would know that they were printing them and then at some point it seems as if it could have been pushing up the price of Bitcoin because whenever Bitcoin slumped there was an increase in the amount of tether that was pushed onto the market and it actually rose the price of Bitcoin up as his tether was being used to buy Bitcoin and therefore kind of a squeeze the supply that was actually circulating so it begs the question what exactly will happens to the market when true at true USD becomes more popular and if USD X becomes more popular especially because it seems that you are capable of mining and therefore creating US dollars will probably get more information about this as time goes along but this is yet another coin that says that they will be pegged to the u.s. dollar or they have found a way to perfectly peg themselves to the US dollar let's see exactly what happens in the crypto market and if this has an effect on prices in the future last up coin base is a smart so they're very smart no matter what they do no matter what kind of controversies they have going on there make sure that they will continue push them selves forward coinbase one of the biggest cryptocurrencies exchange platforms worldwide has announced that it is that it successfully opened a bank account with a major British bank Barclays according to a recent CNBC article most British banks have abstained from doing business with cryptocurrency related businesses in general due to concerns and realistic activities so the fact that coinbase was able to open an account with them is major because not only have British banks been shunning people left and right we were talking about that about a month and a half ago they were pushing back anyone who was trying to open up a bank account if they had anything to do with cryptocurrencies and the fact that coinbase has gotten into the market is very very important especially because I think they were also able"", ""so let's say coinbase decides to forge ahead in order to sell Securities it will have to apply for a broker dealer license or similar Capital markets license for whichever jurisdiction it wants to operate under regulatory jurisdictions in the US include our friend the SEC the financial industry regulatory Authority finra and the regulator in every single state side note this is why U.S exchanges like coinbase Kraken and Gemini are often at pains to point out how many licenses they hold just to operate as they do in the United States and that's a big part of why their trading fees tend to be higher than those of non-us exchanges they have to collectively spend tens of millions of dollars a year just making sure they have the right pieces of paper and lots of pieces of paper at that now these extra licenses an exchange would need to sell guycoin as a security do not come cheap and the process of registering and applying for them will again be tedious lengthy and costly reams of information about The Exchange its products ownership structure Personnel finances risk management processes rules and procedures and on and on and on until the will to live disappears completely there would be yet more regulatory oversight involved and countless Hoops of compliance through which to jump but no license no dice so the exchange is then left with a question is Guy coin now classified as a security like likely to generate enough interest and therefore trading fees to make it worth the hassle and expense of applying for and maintaining all those additional licenses the answer is that guy coin on its own probably isn't if however more cryptos are likely to be labeled as Securities in the wake of guy coin then the case for getting the paperwork done becomes stronger and of course if one exchange decides to pull the trigger its Rivals are going to have to consider doing so as well for fear of getting left behind and handing their competitors an advantage which brings us to the final set of stakeholders impacted by Guy coin security designation the good old guy coin hodlers themselves the guy Brigade guy grenadiers whatever they've called themselves what does all this mean for them well guys de-listing from U.S exchanges will have already devalued their stack and so anyone who bought before the SEC came a knock-in will have already suffered a fair bit they will have to hope that some U.S exchange bites the bullet and applies for those Securities licenses but even if that happens it could be a while before those licenses get issued but wait the SEC is all about protecting investors"", ""and so does that mean we're going to all have different coins and does that mean we're going back to where we are where there's a lack of interoperability don't get it in quote an addition Garlin house says he's struggling to find a coherent use case for JPM coin even if the goal is to have it used internally at JPMorgan he said one more quick thing on JPM coin so let's think about this JPM coin they announced for institutional clients if you gave them a dollar deposit they'll give you a JPM coin that you can then move within the JPM ledger he said wait a minute just use the dollar I really don't understand if you're just giving just moving it within the JPM ledger and it has to be $1 $2 and 1/2 I'm backing I don't understand what problem that solves end quote last month reports surfaced that JPMorgan is starting a new trial that will utilize the company's digital asset JPMorgan coin to settle transactions with his wholesale business clients the blockchain based solution payment solution was initially will initially be tested with a tiny fraction of the company's clientele so the situation that we have right now as we slowly learn more about the JP Morgan coin first of all uh I find it hard to believe that other banks would be using JP Morgan's coins simply because other banks don't like JP Morgan Chase and other banks it's kind of a weird situation like you're probably not gonna find a scenario where Bank of America or PNC are going to agree to use another banks cryptocurrency especially when the weird part is is that the JP Morgan coin is supposed to only be used internally within the JP Morgan Space website and app whatever what-have-you they're saying that it's for quick transfers obviously though I mean it's it's just a really weird situation when it comes to Jamie Dimon who's the CEO of JP Morgan he said that he hated Bitcoin and crypto currencies for a very long time he thought that crypto currencies had no use and now they have tried are trying to create their own crypto currency and I don't know if I can call it a crypto currency especially because as according to reports if you kind of look around it appears that this is only going to be used internally and even more so the people who are going to be allowed to use this will be some of the very richest people who are actually like it says even right here like large institutional JPMorgan clients we can assume that eventually they're probably going to roll out something where everyone on their platform and not just very rich people are able to use the JPMorgan coin but it seems very weird that you would have to have US Dollars and then swap them into the coin and then I don't know it seems a bit pointless I mean we don't know exactly what they're planning this is not the first time that JPMorgan has kind of hinted at something like this has done something similar to this they haven't created their own coin before this feels like an attention-grabbing money grab if that kind of makes any sense in the foreseeable future I do not see a scenario where other banks around the world or even within the United States especially if you've ever watched a documentary on how banks really run they are probably not too keen on listing another banks who they're usually not at war with but you know everyone likes to have their own profits in the banking industry like they're not trying to share customers that they would even think about using another banks coin and this is why crypto currencies and also XRP included are very interesting because the entire idea is that if you all use just one thing and that's kind of agnostic and not exactly through the banking industry you can transfer money between yourselves I have a very strong feeling at some point my you know just my opinion Brad Garlin how has probably met Jamie Dimon at some point and according to rumors Jamie Dimon is probably not the nicest person in the entire world so they probably had a little exchange of words and now this is

now scaled that business up to a point where I'm earning you know typically around $1,000 a day or more sometimes even approaching 2000 and to go from making you know sixty thousand dollars a year or two in some cases 60 thousand dollars a month requires a lot of different mindset changes and shifts and these three things have the largest impact on this journey for myself number one is the five-minute rule and this is one that I just recently started implementing and this basically eliminates POC rastenn ation entirely the five-minute rule is very simple anytime something comes up during the day you think about it in your mind and you say okay is this gonna take me more than five minutes or less than five minutes in any task that comes up throughout the day that's gonna take me less than five minutes I just do it now I don't bother putting it on a list I don't put a reminder in my phone I don't procrastinate I will literally just do it right now and what I found is that 90% of my day-to-day tasks that come up out of nowhere take five minutes or less meaning that they don't end up going on a list they get done right now"", ""this video is sponsored by google pixel 4a the financial advice in this video reflects my personal opinions only and is not endorsed by google or any of its affiliates in the past three years i've made over 100 videos on this channel sharing some of my experiences and things that i've learned thus far in life and in this video i want to share with you eight of the most important and practical lessons that i have learned about money whether we like it or not money plays a crucial role in our livelihoods it decides what we eat for dinner how we vacation and even how we raise our children so let's get started so the first lesson is that money is not the end goal in life now i've spoken to dozens of millionaires and i've asked them some of the mistakes that they've made in the past or things that they would have done differently and one of the biggest things the thing that kept recurring every time that i ask somebody is they told me that sometimes money would skew their decision-making process a little bit more than what they in hindsight would have liked it to do so this is something that you really do need to understand because sometimes we we put money too high on the list for things that are important to us and we can make bad decisions you know for example um if you're looking at two different jobs and one job might pay you five percent more or ten percent more even though you know it's not going to be a very fulfilling job you're not going to like it versus a job that maybe pays you a little bit less but you know it's going to be a fulfilling job you know that you're very passionate about that job many of us still choose that higher paying job even though it's not as exciting it's not something that's fulfilling and so just those little decisions especially those life decisions that are important to think about and make sure that you're not letting money affect some of those decisions even though it is important it's also important to make sure that you're having fun and being happy in life now the next lesson that i've learned is something known as the 80 20 principle and you can use this 80 20 principle and apply it to certain areas of life or certain expenses that traditionally would be large expenses but if you use this correctly we can actually end up saving a lot of money that's why the sponsor for today's video is google pixel 4a the new google phone""]"

episode first new four-year low for Bitcoin dominance we talked about this range for a long time finally doing it could potentially be huge for all coins maybe Bitcoin is the new stable coin and all

sent to Kraken we see large liquidations of Bitcoin going on right now potentially ahead of some news that someone suspects however at this time it is historically the least risky time to buy Bitcoin as a matter of fact historically the risk soar has only been lower in 1.3 percent of the time the further downside from here seems to be fairly limited so why are old investors selling maybe they just

on this is like the straw that breaks the camel's back if Bitcoin breaks below this green line it does not look good it looks like Bitcoin is likely headed to 13 and a half thousand dollars if that should happen now this green line is historically the lowest support that Bitcoin has ever ever had the 280 weekly moving average right now forming this bearish structure ahead and shoulders as the price is just hovering right above where the price is right now that green line eighteen thousand seven hundred dollars if we break below there likely headed down to about thirteen and a half thousand

state of the system based on the color we have 2022 in Orange we have 2021 in this light blue we have 2020 in this kind of greenish color and you can see where Bitcoin Falls right now 2022 mostly on this side which is higher risk and most recently this last one denotes a very very bearish undertone bearish momentum Trend and high risk however the Hefty traded volume and capital flowing back to bitcoin should withstand further selling pressure is the worst past us if we take a look right now dxy very very high as a matter of fact right now it looks very very similar to this structure that built up back here in 2015."", ""yes two days ago we're all the way back into greed this is absolute maniacal Insanity up to 56 today from 49 yesterday down in the 30s two days ago the overall markets

holder cost basis for Bitcoin we dip below there for a while we found support on the convergence of the short-term holder call spaces the realized price of 200-day moving average and the 21 week moving average and we are back above the long-term holder cost basis hurray now that being said we have had some pretty interesting reversals for Bitcoin on the three day charts potentially printing a bullish reversal pattern in 13 hours you can see this right here zoomed in massive down candle massive up candle very significant reversal we saw something very very similar back in 2017 massive down candle massive up candle before even more massive rally that's not the only one the Rob Booker reversal indicator has just flashed only the fourth time in bitcoin's history each time was right before an absolutely massive rally so could this be spelling something huge happening it certainly could and if you don't believe that one how about the gaussian channel turning green on the three day indicating Bitcoin momentum has changed from downward to upward in the midterm perspective we can see the another time that this happened this was in 2020 look at what bitcoin price did after the channel turned green look here we could have a massive rally for Bitcoin and not only Bitcoin but all coins are about to break out probably one of the most bullish charts you'll see from mustache all coins are about to break out of the triangle people will soon understand the cycle from back when it's repeating itself the only difference is the time frame we can see a little bit of triangle right here on the upper cusp of it should things go up we could be breaking out of the triangle the last few times this has happened has led to massive rallies for all coins and you know what's even better is the illiquid supply of Bitcoin maybe not all coins but of Bitcoin to investors realizing they might want to own some Bitcoin now that you can't trust the banks or the fed and good luck getting what's left if you take a look here long-term holders now have 73 percent of the total Supply not getting my coins many others like me myself include which brings us to forty thousand dollar Bitcoin by June this could be something that we're going to see now I'll take away this for the moment with this most recent dip that we had back here and then the little rally to 25 000 that reminded me very much of the summer rally from 2019.""]"

global crypto investment hub Rishi Sonic who served as Britain's Chancellor of the exchequer from 2020 to 2022 and chief secretary to the treasury from 2019 to 2022 has become the prime minister of the UK he succeeded Liz truss who resigned after four to four days in office as prime minister Sonic formally accepted his new role from King Charles during a meeting at Buckingham Palace on Monday after winning the conservative party leadership many people have called Sonic Pro crypto for his efforts to make Britain a global hub for crypto assets technology and investment as announced by the UK government in April he said at the time it's my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology and the measures we've outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest innovate and scale up in this country the British government also affirmed that it will see stable coins recognized as a valid form of payment as part of wider plans to make Britain a global hub for crypto asset technology and investment moreover the government noted that it will explore ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system to encourage further development of the crypto asset Market in the UK Sonic also commissioned the Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token we want to see the businesses of tomorrow and the jobs they create here in the UK and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term Seneca Pine this is part of our plan to ensure the UK Financial Services industry is always at the Forefront of technology and innovation however the new prime minister is also pro-central Bank digital currencies which has caused concerns among some crypto advocates in October last year he explained how cbtc's could benefit businesses and consumers as the G7 issued report on the subject Sonic also set up a task force to lead the UK's work on a central bank digital currency Central Bank digital currencies are a very controversial topic so let me know what you guys think about them in the comments below if you are still watching it would be massively appreciated if you could go ahead and smash the like button it costs nothing

musk officially owns Twitter something that I'm sure lots of people didn't see coming a few months ago but this is one of the biggest business moves in the past 10 years but what does this have to do with a social media cryptocurrency well a couple of months bacolin musk tweeted saying free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle this poll resulted in 70 percent of people saying no illin musk replied to the Tweet saying the consequences of this poll will be important please vote carefully it has been sent before that Twitter has a political bias this was made clear with the Banning of controversial ex-president Donald Trump with lots of people thinking he was unfairly banned due to the fact that Twitter is one of the biggest Platforms in the world it's extremely important that there is no political bias as the power of Twitter could literally control elections now there is no stopping Elon Musk from having his own political bias except there already is a solution completely trackable blockchain algorithms to prove that no opinion is being Shadow banned and hidden from most users on Twitter now what if I told you that there was already a token which is specializing in developing a decentralized social media this token has also raised over 200 million dollars and is backed by Sequoia and recent Horowitz

two-day RSI at support line consolidation is drying up now previous times we saw this support it wasn't long before Bitcoin prices went up the suggesting bitcoin price could go up as a matter of fact flipping the broadening wedge for the top and bottom we had a right angled ascending broadening wedge flipped to the bottom now we have a right angled descending broadening wedge which should flip to the top after we have some consolidation from the breakout so this is suggest prices would be going up as a matter of fact falling wedge as well finding support on the 38 to FIB right here basically the previous time that this happened falling wedge support broke out of their massive rally again three-day candles falling wedge support on 38.2 FIB breaking out which we're seeing right here could have a massive rally following right now the sell side risk ratio is approaching all time lows very interesting to note you can see this down here pretty much doesn't get much lower than this the last time it was in this territory was as a matter of fact right before Bitcoin exploded from ten thousand to seventy thousand dollars now this indicates that investors are reluctant to spend coins which are in profit or loss within the current price range this usually occurs when sellers are exhausted on both sides suggesting big moves are coming once again just like this sideways movement wedge inside of a wedge big moves are coming where are they coming well how about this daily macd lines crossing a bullish Divergence showing on the histogram we can see this going up while price action going down the same time frame that is a bullish Divergence suggesting price would go up and a bullish Mac D cross all of those suggesting price go up also when we take a look at Bitcoin log price versus adjusted log time this shows the time gap between Peaks 10.2 log periods between Peaks well we have another Peak coming up and this same log line right here would suggests that bitcoin price has a lot higher to go in a very short period of time suggesting we might have a massive parabolic rally on the horizon you know who knows this whales do if we take a look at the trend accumulation

27.6 can we break outside of this downtrend and hold it interesting question now it appears like everyone just got faked out once again based on the 200ma of the 12 hour candles on the downtrend we had fake outs to the upside and it looks like on the uptrend we have fake apps to the downside once again Bitcoin right now repeating what we saw in 2014 to 2017 we're here to break down we had some resistance a few times and broke between there and once we broke above finding support taking off well same exact thing where we broke down resistance a few times now we are in between pretty much where we were in this area could be a nice setup for Bitcoin but it appears like that area where Bitcoin is sitting is it Wick off accumulation mode Bitcoin has completed the macro Wick off accumulation the whole accumulation lasted for one year now phase after accumulation would be markup phase that's right after whales get all the Bitcoin they can at cheap prices well the price goes up and they start selling that Bitcoin it turns out that while a lot of people are saying crypto is over we do have a bullish Divergence right here on the price and if we take a look on a macro scale where we are markup correction accumulation and then markup phase this is what we saw uh previously with the total market cap where once we broke this downtrend and found support on there took off for a new markup phase well look at where we are right now broke above the downtrend finding support there could potentially be the next markup phase it turns out that based on the November 28th Cycles Theory uh it remains perfectly on track and still calls for thirty four and a half thousand dollars by November of this year the next Blue year will establish time around the price before advancing to new all-time highs so tell me why are you still worried we are still on track for Price going up slowly at first and then after the halfing much more quickly as a matter of fact it's likely that crypto and NASDAQ are likely to follow the Nikki McKay into high levels new all-time highs well for crypto that would be a large increase to go back up to new all-time Highs but you can see all of these have broken through previous downtrends and at least the Nick hey and NASDAQ have had pretty good gains crypto is still pretty sideways since breaking outside of there now for ethereum and all

thing if you're already wealthy it's easy to find new ways to make money but if you have nothing to fall back on it's not exactly looking so good it was recently found that just 30 percent of the poorest american families have a savings account millions of working americans still can't afford food and rent 54 say they're living paycheck to paycheck inflation is said to be crushing the middle class and on average 500 000 is the amount it would take to make them feel financially secure fortunately though there is a solution for anyone who wants to build up their wealth starting from nothing and it does not involve the same cookie cutter advice listed in every single article like 15 of your income invest in a 401k live below your means don't go to coachella and make sure to get your free stock down below in the description because it's worth all the way to a thousand dollars even though i admit it's still good advice and it's probably way better than what the majority of people are doing but in terms of effectively and realistically building your wealth starting from nothing regardless of your education and background these are my own recommendations that i have learned firsthand because there are some step-by-step rules that anyone can follow that work incredibly well and don't cost you a single penny besides of course one like on the video it helps out my channel tremendously and it also gives me a good indication if this is something you want to hear more of so if it is let me know by hitting the like button and i can do more like this in the future"", ""so here's the deal it was recently found that real wages have barely budged in decades more than half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and the poorest 70 of U.S households don't even have a savings account however there is some good news because the survey reported that Americans would need 500 000 to feel financially secure and a million dollars to retire so in this video we're going to be talking about how to do exactly that starting from nothing in 10 years I know that sounds extremely far-fetched but it's entirely possible and these are my own recommendations from personal experience that I've learned firsthand because there are some step-by-step rules that anyone can follow that work incredibly well that don't cost you a single penny if you have the goal of calling yourself a millionaire exactly 10 years from today although really quick if you enjoy topics like this it would help me out tremendously if you hit the like button or subscribe if you haven't done that already doing that gives me a really good indication of whether or not I should make more videos like this in the future so let me know thank you so much for watching and now let's begin to start before we go into the steps that you could take I'm first going to tell you how I was able to build a million dollar net worth by the age of 26 years old without coming from a wealthy family without any inheritance and without posting a single YouTube video on how to get rich because despite me now making a lot of money talking on YouTube about how to make a lot of money that's not how it initially started but first for Ryan to making money came when I was about 16 years old working a part-time job throughout high school at the time I was paid one dollar for every picture I took in Photoshop that a marine aquarium wholesaler so instead of being paid for my time I was paid on results on a really good day if I was focused I'd be able to make anywhere from 80 to 120 dollars for about five to eight hours worth of work and I loved it now I don't usually recommend that other teenagers follow this advice but I would usually skip school work weekends and take every holiday as an opportunity to earn even more and by the time I was 18 years old I had about five thousand dollars saved up now from there I decided not to pursue college and instead use some of those savings to get licensed as a real estate agent so I could do that full-time even though I didn't know know anyone in the industry and I hadn't the slightest clue what I was doing I would spend every weekend going to open houses and asking other agents how they were able to grow their business by pure luck I met an agent who allowed me to work underneath them help them out with whatever he needed and whatever business I brought in would be split 50 50."", ""they either just make drastic lifestyle changes way too late or they just accept that they'll never be ahead financially which is not going to happen on my watch that's why my number one piece of advice for anyone between the ages of 18 and 35 is just to spend less money than you make i know this one might sound common sense to you and i but believe me it's not common sense to most people out there especially when you consider that forty percent of americans don't have enough in savings to cover a one thousand dollar emergency so the easiest way to get out of that trap is to cut back on your spending and get rid of any discretionary expenses that you might have also websites like mint.com and personalcapital.com are completely free and incredibly easy to use and believe me trust me when i say this the hardest part about doing all of this is just starting and just starting to turn this into a habit and a routine but once you start doing this the benefits are going to become monumental you're going to have extra money left over at the end of every single week and you're going to have disposable income left over that you can now go and invest with this step is really just about seeing the long term and realizing the opportunity that you have right now to begin investing as soon as possible these are really your prime savings years because you have the power of compound interest behind you so you may as well just take advantage of that while you still can i'm not sure if you can see ramsay here by the way but in the last video a lot of people were complaining that i wasn't giving ramsay enough pets so i'm going to give ramsay some pets here here you go and one of the tricks i often do when it comes to spending and saving money is i just think to myself if i don't go and buy something it's like i almost got paid not to buy it like for instance because i didn't go out and spend ten dollars on a hamburger on my drive home from work i just saved ten dollars which is kind of like i got paid an extra ten dollars not to spend it if that makes sense this way your brain almost starts to rewire itself and rewards you for not spending money because you act as though that is just money you got paid not to spend i don't know if that makes sense let me know if that hopefully makes sense now given that statistic about 40 of americans not being able to afford a thousand dollar emergency that has been fairly consistent among all the money related videos that i've seen where the subjects of the videos have gotten themselves into horrible credit card or student loan debt i've seen everything from tens of thousands of dollars in outstanding credit card bills to egregious student loan balances and otherwise just a lack of consideration for trying to pay those down as soon as possible and here's the thing i really believe that having any amount of unpaid consumer debt will grossly hinder your ability to build wealth in the future it's almost as though you're borrowing from tomorrow and the day after to go and pay for today if that makes sense so if at all possible avoid consumer debt at all costs use it only as a last case resort if something terrible happens and you just you need it to put food on the table or there's just no other option to turn to except for a credit card but do not make that a substitute for i can't afford to eating out with my friends every single night at nobu and malibu""]"

have point here point here we just extend it and generally somehow magically things seem to continue to bounce off of there that ends up being the trend and this trend is actually called a bullish megaphone because it looks like a megaphone now another line that we've been using for this time would be support and resistance so we had previous resistance right around twenty thousand dollars this dotted line right here in the middle of the screen and as you can see when bitcoin came up there it was rejected it was rejected it was rejected it was rejected and then finally it broke through previous support and resistance oftentimes end up being support and resistance for the time being now furthermore what i used was a moving average this blue line this is the four hour ma50 and basically as you can see here on the way up it was support support support broke through on top again support support broke through support support support support so as you can see these moving averages can tend to be support and resistance and then once we finally reached an extension of previous all-time highs once we doubled it the price started coming back down now how did i know this trend line well basically there were two things one i use fibonacci extensions and two i look at big events big events are places where people put sell orders like round numbers like thirty thousand forty thousand thirty five thousand forty five thousand whatever they are and there tends to be a lot of money exchanging hands well bitcoin made it all the way up to forty thousand dollars but then couldn't break through and came back down"", ""support and resistance support and resistance are probably the two most important words in technical trading support is a level or area with the surplus of buyers that acts like a floor of causing price to bounce off it and reverse resistance is an area or level with the surplus of sellers that acts like a ceiling that causes price to bounce off of it and reverse support resistance levels are based on historical pricing one price stops and reverses it forms a support resistance point there is an increased chance that if price hits the area again it will stop and reverse again furthermore if prices has stopped and reversed in the same spot more than once already if the price hits that area again the chance of it reversing again is even greater sometimes red lines have life support as well what this happens price bounces off of the tread line often price will channel would tweet to support resistant slides with two trend lines what causes support and resistance why this price sometimes seem to magically reverse at the same price over and over again there are lots of different thoughts and theories on the subject however what it comes down to is that support and resistance happens because behind the millions of trades each day are millions of traders markets are not made up of price charts that move up and down at random markets are made up of people people that think and feel and have emotions furthermore markets are not just made up of people but of crowds crowds at very primitive they lose the ability to think individually research for a leader they act irrationally they follow the same patterns and they repeat themselves in short support and resistance happens because markets follow patterns because markets are made up of crowds and crowds follow patterns drawing support and resistance lines is not complicated usually this is achieved by simply connecting two or more spots that price reversed on on either a horizontal or a slanted line there is no one correct way to draw support and resistance lines and when the lines are actually placed as a matter of personal preference some traders will connect the extreme highs or lows like right here others will you just use the bodies of the candles and ignore the wicks and still others although not as common will simply draw the line right through the thickest cluster hoping to get as many people as possible included each trader must find what works best for them support resistors works in both directions when price breaks through support it becomes resistance what price breaks through resistance it becomes support one price is inside the walls on the channel the walls help keep price inside the channel one price breaks through the walls of the channel the walls help keep price out of the channel there are other forms of support and resistance as well whole numbers moving averages pivot points Fibonacci numbers and more typically the more tides price respects to support a resistance level the stronger that level is however the hits a threshold at a certain point where price is respected the area so many times that the area begins to become weaker and the chance of breaking through begins to increase with each new approach as price approaches support a resistance traders will use volume and momentum to gauge whether the field price will break through support or resistance or bounce off in reverse since volume is not available in spot forex traders will sometimes use the volume from currency futures as a substitute as price approaches support a resistance is price gaining steam with the volume increasing or as price losing momentum and volume decreasing the support and resistance lines on a longer time frame chart will be stronger than the support resistance lives on a shorter timeframe chart for instance the support resistance lines on a weekly chart will be stronger than the support resistance lines on a daily chart and the support resistance lives on a daily chart will be stronger then the support resist on an hourly chart the support level on a 15-minute chart probably isn't going to cause the price to change on a daily chart however price on a 15-minute chart may bounce off of a daily support level over time older support resistance lines tend to fade in strength as older traders wash out leave the markets in newer traders enter the markets that were not in the market the last time the support and resistance level was respected so that concludes a basic overview of support and resistance this is the end of the first video on the subject in the next video we'll cover the support resistance price cycle see you then"", ""so when we price dips below the view app line that line switches to resistance and the lower 25 percent threshold serves as support now this is where it gets interesting so going back to one of the most helpful uses of these lines that they give you an early indication or a warning sign of a more sustained upward momentum if you see an increase above the 75% tile line that's an early warning sign of this uptrend and if you drop below the bottom line that's a bigger sign of a downtrend this makes a lot more sense when you think about the rules of support and resistance when something breaks above resistance that's a sign we'll see higher highs and when something breaks below support that's a sign that we'll see lower lows while this is true by definition you must use your understanding of the RSI the MACD and most importantly the SMA to most accurately predict how far up or how far down these are going to go afterwards so at this point you should have a good general idea of what the V whap is and how it is used so let's go over another example to really beat this in so let's look at Tesla now if we are looking at Tesla and today we can spot many points where the V whap would have been useful first off the stock price pretty much held support and traded below the view app and held about at resistance thing here as we did see several breaks above the V whop line but they fail to support so that wasn't a strong indication of a continued uptrend now when we saw this more consistent gap up later which by the way had consistently growing real estate between itself and the SMA line which which is why it's so important to combine your usage of other indicators but we then saw a breaking above the V whop line which means that this V whop line was no longer resistance but now serves as a support line as a reminder when shares are trading under the line it serves as resistance and wind shears break above the line that serves as support anyways now as we know from the price action earlier a break above the V whop line means that we are experiencing higher highs but it doesn't mean that the stock will continue up trending but again an early sign of a continued uptrend was this consistent gap above the SMA line and most importantly it is consistent over all dipping back and forth from support then later we saw a gap in the SMA line and a continued uptrend I just want to reiterate that these indicators are never an end-all be-all of the stock market it's really about developing a skill set and working knowledge around using all these indicators in conjunction with solid strategies and more consistent practice honestly it's all about practice and learning the EFT you have to or ball this stuff like a sponge and the best way to do this is by watching these videos by watching other trailer videos a lot of traders don't recommend you to watch other training videos but there's just there's such there's such a plethora a plethora of knowledge on the internet that you could absorb and it's super important for your training to just take in all the dog you can as well as all of the practice but anyways if you have any questions for me or comments or whatever comment below we also have the zip trader circle Facebook group which I plugged a bit in the beginning but it's really a great place to learn and it's really a great place to connect with other traders because at the end of the day it's all about building a community and being involved in this greater training community but anyways I hope that this video was helpful for you and I'll see you guys in the next video have a great week

blockchain-based social network would be to finance and Advance its development musk called it a super interesting idea and offered to help however once Dorsey failed in his attempt to get musk on the

But, long-term, buy-and-hold investors won out. If you had bought Amazon right at this peak,\xa0right before the .com bubble crash, but held without selling, you\'d still be up nearly 1,600% today. So, when you think about buying businesses instead of tickers, that leads you to look at important factors like management and sustainable competitive advantages, instead of short-term market noise. That\'s how you find great companies.\xa0  Think about it this way. Would you ever give your money to a friend or coworker that you didn\'t trust? The same is true for investing. You should find leadership that\'s trustworthy, inspirational, and dedicated. Look for businesses with missions that you appreciate and management teams that have their compensation tied to long-term business results. That way, your incentives as an investor are aligned with theirs. In Amazon\'s first shareholder letter, Jeff Bezos wrote, ""We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value that we create over the long term.', ""and if I show you a picture of their stock chart I think you'll understand why over the last six months or so the stock has basically been reset 2020 levels due to their business suffering at the hands of the macro economic environment see over the last few years Amazon has really focused on expanding capacity to increase their revenue and their profitability but of course with this inflation we've seen right now their costs are rising equally as quickly their costs of goods sold are rising operating expenses are rising and ultimately for Amazon earnings are suffering however many value investors is the betting that while they're going through some short-term pain at the moment this period of investment will ultimately set them up for long-term gain as this is a trend we've seen for decades with Amazon money's probably among others is quick to use Amazon as an example of exceptional Capital allocation and you can see from this chart thanks to my buddies Brad and David that Amazon will not stop investing into growing their company as you can see while Alibaba and Google and meta and apple are generating cash and they're just sticking it on the pile 10 cent and Amazon are the only two on the list that are taking their money plus some and putting it back into growth Avenues within the business now businesses don't just do this willy-nilly so a table like this really shows you the companies that genuinely believe that they have something worth investing in so that's the story with Amazon and now finally we get to our most bought stock in q1 of 2023 and it is Google"", ""so if you were to put in a thousand dollars you would make 760 dollars you would have 1 760 dollars if you were to buy a thousand dollars worth of it now and sell it at previous all-time highs again we're not talking about a pump and dump we're not talking about a penny stock we're talking about one of the most valuable companies that are publicly traded now the cheap can always get cheaper Amazon can still sell off but the idea is to buy not at a perfect time but to buy when it makes sense and this is why you create your plan of action you can buy some now you can buy someone that begins to indicate signs of an uptrend and then you can buy someone that's actually making hot signs or showing signs of higher highs and higher lows but the idea is this whole video is to show you that there is so much opportunity out there with even the most basic and established companies let's go ahead and finish it off with apple now Apple was literally the first company in history to hit a three trillion dollar market cap right now it trades at 2.22 so you can imagine what the ROI is going to be right now it's trading at 138 a share pretty affordable and if it were to return to previous all-time highs of 182 it would offer a 31 nearly 32 return now again some of you in comparison to Tesla with 100 or Amazon with 76 percent it doesn't sound like a huge return nothing is guaranteed in the stock market but I would say nothing trades like Apple apple is as close to guaranteed in my experience as any other company out there and something to operate 31 Roi is insane I mean apple is literally a market leader it moves major markets and indexes anytime that it has a green day or a red day that's the influence that Apple has I know for myself at least the three different companies that we just talked about are companies that I decided to invest into for my daughter's brokerage account that I opened up under my name and again it's investing now during an uncertain time that my future self can really thank me for right right now I might might just be worth around 75 000""]"

an entrepreneur and say no to the conventional life trust me this was super scary because i'd spent the previous 23 years believing the only way to get rich was to become a doctor or a lawyer but luckily i took a leap of faith and within five years i had my first one million dollar year i'm not saying that to brag because if you got to see some of the struggles and major failures i've had on that path it wouldn't seem all that impressive but i want to be transparent with you guys and i actually share my detailed monthly income reports on my instagram page and the reason for that is because i know that it's going to make more people go out and find their plane too by sharing my struggles my wins and my story i know people will relate because there has got to be millions of people in the same exact shoes i was in walking but knowing they want to run or in our case fly so is that it is that the shortcut to becoming insanely rich the answer is sorta and the following section is even more important because you need to understand it otherwise you'll stop halfway while trying to find your plane and the hard truth is that while the plan exists for all of us finding it is actually extremely extremely hard i'll stop speaking figuratively and just say flat out making your first 100 000 is extremely difficult likely much harder than working a normal 9 to 5 job and that is why so many people end up quitting the pursuit the thing with entrepreneurship is that it revolves heavily around a compound growth curve this is what the typical income graph looks like for someone with a good job we have single digit raises most years but overall it's pretty flat over the first few years you'll likely make more money than your peers trying to start their own businesses now let's layer on the income of a pretty typical entrepreneur obviously some major differences at first glance right most entrepreneurs will make very little at the start because the first 100 000 is so incredibly hard you're learning you're trying new things failing doing a lot of work but not getting paid and as a result you'll probably make less money that's exactly what happened to me i did not make good money coming out of college because i did not have a nine-to-five job instead i pursued side hustles and started businesses and i actually lost money on a lot of my ventures but like all challenging things at some point you'll get through that initial trek through mud and cow turds and stumble across a scene much nicer which is basically unlimited income potential on your schedule stick through those initial years and you'll hit that inflection point where your income surpasses that of your friends continues rising and then eventually reaches the moon here's a clip from elon musk on what it was like in his first years as an entrepreneur sleeping in an office and showering at the ymca when my brother and i were starting our first company instead of getting an apartment we just rented us a small office and we slept on the couch and we we showered at the the ymca and uh we're so hot up"", ""soozee subscribers thank you so much for joining me today I am Jeremy this is the

investing or paying that pays attention to finance it's the most useful tool you'll ever use in your life as far as opening it's the same as like if you're a house builder a hammer a hammers are the most useful tool you ever use right a compounding calculator for someone that wants to invest in stock market look into investing those some of those kinds of things a compounding calculator is the most powerful tool you'll ever use in your life because you will realize the possibilities on how fast money can grow and how well it can grow if you do certain things and you just get this type of person or returning guys now if you're looking for how to actually make a million dollars in stock market or something and not just like compounding calculator watch one of my million stock market videos or better yet watch one of my eight billion entrepreneur type videos where I give away business tips because that's the fastest way to become a millionaire before starting a business build it up to be a business has never been a better time to start an entrepreneur 'april ever in history guys never ever so that's the way to do it but let's play around this compounding calculator guys so let's say you started out with $100 right and this is our first one we're going to look at you never put another dollar in it and you grew that money for 40 years now I use 40 years for all of these calculations guys since the majority of the people are watch this channel or between the ages of 18 and 35 like 70% of channels 1835 so almost all you guys have wanted to get to live regular lives and

and I'm here today with our ask a fool series today's question comes from Roselle melodious who asks which is better a 457 plan or a 401 k plan now Roselle brings up a question that's really difficult for a lot of people to understand with all these numbers referring to IRS Code sections of the tax law but basically what we're talking about is a 401 K which is a normal retirement plan that employers in the private sector offer to their employees to help them save for retirement versus a 457 plan which is a similar type of plan that is usually offered to government employees and for most purposes they're very similar both tend to have limited menus of investment options that people can choose from and so in general my advice would be for someone to consider which investment options are better if the 401 K gives you a better set of low-cost investment options typically mutual funds or exchange-traded funds then the 457 then go with the 401 K on the other hand if your 457 plan offers better investment options that have lower costs and better potential returns then that's a reasonable choice to make as well now there's one aspect where 457 plans and 401 k plans especially differ and that has to do with penalties for early withdrawals 401 k plans if you take money out early before you turn age 59 and a half the money you take out is subject to a 10% penalty but that penalty doesn't apply to early withdrawals from 457 plans and so if you anticipate an early retirement where you're going to need to draw money from your plan then putting more money in a 457 may be your better bet if that's not a if that's not a problem however what you're really going to want to focus on is those investment choices and making sure you get the best deal that will help your investments grow as much as possible for more on saving for retirement in the various tax advantaged plans that are available be sure to stay tuned to to fool.com thanks for watching and fool on"", ""I'm gonna go and set one up and if you're not familiar with what a Roth IRA is all it is is a retirement account that lets you contribute what's called post tax money that just means that you've already paid taxes on the money you contribute to that account and then the age of 59 and a half all of the profit that you've made within the Roth IRA is yours to keep completely tax-free now this account is really good to start as a teenager or really as young as you possibly can for two main reasons the first reason is that chances are you're not making a lot of money right now and chances are because of that you're not paying a lot in taxes that's really the perfect time to invest within a Roth IRA because right now you're not losing a lot of money to taxes like you would later in life when you're potentially in a higher tax bracket a second when you're young you also have the power of compound interest this is where your money makes you more money that then makes you more money that makes you more money it's kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill and as it continues rolling it starts getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger that's compound interest like let's just take this example let's just say that you invest $5,000 at the age of 30 at an 8% return that means at the age of 60 that $5,000 will have turned into just over $50,000 but on the other hand if you invested that same $5,000 at the age of 18 instead of at the age of 30 by the time you're 60 that $5,000 will have turned into more than 120 $6,000 that means that just by investing your money a little bit earlier you will have more than doubled your profit by the age of 60 thanks to compound interest so that's why you need to start a Roth IRA as soon as you possibly can preferably as soon as you turn 18 years old I have my Roth IRA set up through Vanguard"", ""hello fools driver bro campus in your advisor for The Motley Fool's rule your retirement service as part of our ask a full series we have a question from Gil Gil asked what are the rules laws and regulations whereby a first time homebuyer can take a distribution from a Roth IRA to fund a home purchase and what are the tax implications involved so first of all let's define what a first-time homebuyer is it doesn't mean that you've never owned a home it just means that you've not owned a home in the past two years and to use this exception for any sort of IRA with the first-time home purchase it has to be for your principle residents can't be for any investment investment property or anything like that the general rule is for both traditional and Roth IRAs is that you can take out ten thousand dollars per person twenty thousand dollars per couple to use for a home purchase and you will not be subject to the ten percent penalty that most distributions are subject to when you take it out before fifty nine and a half now the interesting thing about the Roth IRA is that actually for any situation you can take out the contributions the money that you put in tax and penalty free because you already paid the taxes on it any growth and earnings you cannot take out before age 59 and a half except for some exceptions and one of those exceptions is the first-time homebuyer but only if the account has been open for five years if it has been open for five years you can take all that money out tax-free for the first-time home purchase if it has not been open for five years it is treated just like the traditional IRA when it comes to home purchases and that is the money the earnings are taxed as ordinary income you just escape the ten percent penalty the other thing you need to remember about this is that you don't have forever to do it you have a hundred and twenty days between the time you take the money out and the time you put it towards the home purchase so don't take it out too early I hope that answers your question Gail if you have any other questions about home buying taxes investing

most households this is our third largest expense only behind housing and transportation and if you live in an urban area food is your second largest expense statistically so we spend a lot of money on food obviously we need food to survive but how can we save money on food i save thousands of dollars per year as compared to maybe the average person on food expenses by using a variety of different tactics i'm gonna share with you in this video and it's not by starving yourself or or by uh eating at at some obscure place that you're getting like 50 cent uh food items i don't know where the hell is going with that so let's get started with this video i think there's gonna be some really fun topics in here i'll show you some of the actual strategies that i use in my kitchen might cook a couple things as well we've had quite a few requests for uh some some nate cooking videos so we might slide in a couple little recipes in there but let's get started here and let's start with the first kind of idea that we need to think about when we're trying to save money on foods that we're not spending seven thousand dollars per year but maybe getting it down to uh three or four thousand dollars per year on food expenses while still being healthy so the first thing we have to do is we have to plan ahead now obviously this this seems pretty obvious it seems pretty simple um but many people don't do this so what we need to do here is before we walk into a grocery store because we haven't eaten in two days and we're starving and we're just gonna spend like 400 on random food because we're so hungry don't go to the grocery store on an empty stomach this is like the first big problem but the worst is when people go to the store on an empty stomach and they also don't have a plan for the week so start planning out your meals ahead of time plan them out for a week i basically have six different blocks of meals that i line up four weeks and then i can alternate these weeks"", ""[Music] so food is one of the largest expenses that we have in our lives in fact it actually comes in at number three only behind housing costs and transportation costs so the average American household spends about seven thousand seven hundred and twenty nine dollars per year on food alone so in this video I'm going to show you some ways you can cut back on food expenses while still getting plenty of nutrients and the things that you need to keep yourself very healthy and so what we're gonna do in this video is I'm going to show you what I've personally done to save some money on food but still balancing that out with eating healthy foods I think there's kind of this misconception that it's very difficult to eat healthy for little amounts of money hopefully we can debunk that today in this video but we were actually pretty hesitant to make this because you know people have very different goals and agendas when it comes to eating food and nutrition and look I'm not a dietitian I'm not a nutritionist I'm not a doctor this is what works for me this is what I've done in the past I spend a little bit more money on food now as my budget has been increasing as my income has been increasing but I'm going to show you what I've done in the past and look everybody has different goals some people want to lose weight some people are trying to gain weight some people are gluten-free or vegan or they only eat meat there's just so many different types of diets out there that this is not a one-size-fits-all video what you need to keep in mind for today's video is that this is really oriented on getting the most bang for your buck when it comes to eating food so we're looking at the most calories we're looking at the most food possible for about 30 to 40 dollars per week and and let's just get started with this let's actually go over the grocery store right now I'm gonna give you a lot of different tips and tricks that you can use to cut back on cost

process of proving his identity and voila now he has his money back how cool is that and believe it or not that is just one avenue to see if the government owes us money there are five more like it

the department of labor has your money because they keep it there for up to three years you can also search for unclaimed pensions from companies that have went out of business or ended a specific pension plan and you can do that by going to pbgc dot gov forward slash search dash unclaimed dash pensions and see if you wrote anything now once you've done that the third place to look for money for free from the government is actually from insurance and there's two major categories the first one is from veterans life insurance funds so if you go to insurance.va.gov forward slash unclaimed funds a previous policyholder might be owed money or you if you knew a veteran that had a policy and designated you as the beneficiary and you just didn't even know about it and the second insurance category is actually from the fha mortgage so if you own a house and you're paying a mortgage on it you might be owed money from hud the department of housing and urban development and you can actually check to see that from the website that's on the screen right now and the fourth place to look is from tax refunds which makes sense because when you owe money to the irs they will find you hiding under a rock on an island"", ""that's another problem here's the thing is most of you know anytime you make a deposit within a bank you're protected by what's called FDIC insurance which protects up to the first two hundred and fifty thousand dollars you have deposited in the event of a bank failure this was created after the bank runs the 1920s Great Depression as a way to incentivize people to re-trust the banking system and it largely worked since then FDIC insurance has continued to evolve for any Bank who wants to legally operate in the United States and the good news is that it's a fairly efficient system in fact their website says that you could get access to your money within a few days after the bank's closing however in this case the bad news is that as Genevieve from grit Capital points out only two point seven percent of silicon Valley's Bank deposits are less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars meaning ninety seven point three percent of their money is not FDIC insured and it's not clear exactly what's going to happen to all of that money now typically in cases where deposits exceed the FDIC limit losses are recovered in a bankruptcy court when assets are sold off to pay their creditors but his bank rate explains that process could take several years to complete and more than likely their customers are not going to receive all of their money back from what they started with although to me that isn't even the worst of it instead it's just how far this is about to reach over the coming few days and weeks and I have a feeling this is really only the tip of the iceberg for those in aware Silicon Valley Bank isn't just a bank for the average person they're the bank for a significant portion of venture-backed companies throughout the United States and when those businesses keep a significant portion or even all of their money with one institution they could be completely wiped out overnight the reality is many of these institutions have raised millions or even tens of millions of dollars with the expectation that that's going to be enough to last them throughout these next few years those businesses have carefully saved money kept it liquid for emergencies and have spent it wisely only to have it reduced to 250 000 overnight from that perspective this is going to be crippling to every single business that banks with Silicon Valley Bank especially since they currently hold more than 342 billion dollars worth of customer funds now realistically a startup is not going to lose all their money with the bank and it's not like every dollar over 250 000 is suddenly worth zero but it could take years to recover whatever's left and whether or not the company has enough money to stay afloat in the meantime is completely up in the air I would venture to say that most of them cannot just consider that everything from payroll company expenditures and all of their overheads could be held in One bank and 250 000 could be a drop in the buck pocket for a company who had saved significantly more to make it through a time of slower growth there's really no way out of this with the exception of trying to raise cash as desperately as possible in a panic at a discount downsizing significantly or going under which is something that no one thought would happen just a week ago so that then of course begs the question could the same thing happen to your bank the answer is it's possible but it's unlikely the issue with Silicon Valley Bank was that they were in a niche market servicing startups and were funded by Venture Capital which was drying up that meant that very little money was flowing in a lot of money was flowing out and the majority of the bank's Capital was locked away in bonds for the next four years at a low interest rate that had declined in value essentially this meant that if the bank were to wait long enough they would have enough cash on hand and potentially absorb the short-term losses but when everyone begins withdrawing all of their money all at the exact same time the bank is left with no other choice other than to shut down now sure in essence every every single Bank operates this way and is only required to keep 10 percent of customer funds on hand at all time to process withdrawals but in Silicon Valley Bank's case they went all in on the bond market at the worst possible time at the very Peak""]"

in the middle of playoff season for the NBA and the NHL would you take Jimmy Butler off of the Miami Heat would you take Matthew could chuck off the Florida Panthers they're clearly the MVP of both

Nvidia Scott so a lot of the moves that were made in the Joe T strategy I'm very satisfied with because we got ahead of recognizing momentum that was building and we were in there and we were adding

to palantir"", ""hi I'm Jimmy in this video we're looking at the U.S economy to see if we think that the U.S economy is going to get stronger or weaker we're going to use different economic indicators to ultimately try to answer the question do we invest now or wait for the stock market to crash again our first economic indicator is is an important one and this is the yield curve so this is the U.S treasury yield curve which tracks the interest rate for U.S treasuries for different time periods and sadly this yield curve is actually known as an inverted yield curve because short-term rates are higher than long-term rates this is a bad sign for the overall economy because an inverted yield curve has preceded every financial crash in stock market history for like the past 100 and some odd years so this is a bad sign now if we're curious the yield curve is supposed to be uh normally you have curve is shaped like that it's supposed to be heading higher which makes a lot of sense if you think about it short-term interest rates for example if you're going to invest for three months you should receive a lower interest rate than if you were going to invest for 30 years that is why it's normal the current yield curve you receive more money for investing shorter than you do longer overall that's a problem and this is going to be a bearish point for the US economy so on our scorecard here our first point goes to the Bears okay up next we've got consumer confidence so ultimately what consumer confidence is it tries to measure how confident individuals or families are in their financial position so that's everything from expenses how much life is costing them to how much money they're making for wages or how secure they feel their jobs are this is a very important number because the consumer is one of the most important parts one of the biggest drivers to the US economy so obviously higher is better here higher consumer confidence is a good thing we could see last year the numbers sort of bottomed out here back in mid-2022 and that's clearly a bad sign now since then the number has gradually recovered which is a positive sign for consumer confidence is beginning to get up to hopefully more reasonable level levels now I was on the fence with how to score this one do we make it a bearish point or do we make it a neutral point we can see on the scorecard here that ultimately I decided to go neutral on this one and that's only because the recovery has happened over the past few months it wasn't just a one-up and back down which sometimes happens with consumer confidence but if you disagree with this and you think that consumer confidence should still be in the bearish category please let me know in the comments below"", ""what's up everyone thanks for checking out this video this is going to be a concise beginner's guide to the stock market when i checked out some of the other videos on the stock market while some of them said they were for beginners they were an hour hour and a half long and they very quickly got into some fairly advanced concepts different scc filings 10k 10q 8k s3 forms pe ratios acronyms things like that and i feel like that's not really beginner stuff that stuff is important and if you're really inspired and excited after watching this concise beginner's guide by all means dig into that more advanced stuff but let's keep this high level so this is going to be a beginner's guide to the stock market and i want to talk a little bit about becoming a trader so high level what is the stock market well the stock market is a place where individual investors like you and me can buy shares of what are sometimes huge companies like apple facebook netflix tesla etc and when we buy a share even just one share we become a fractional little tiny owner of this huge company and of course when we buy the price of the company at the time that we buy it is based on a number of factors one factor certainly is their profitability but a big factor is their perceived future potential and future profitability that's why sometimes you'll see companies that actually aren't really profitable or aren't profitable at all but still trade at a very high price because people believe in the company's future earnings potential their growth their future value so there's a lot of speculation in the market but in any case when you buy a stock at the time that you buy it the prices whatever it is if this the company is successful in achieving that future growth over time the company will increase in value the total market cap will grow the value will go up and therefore your fractional ownership your tiny your one share whatever it is will increase in value and so the reason people have been attracted to the market for so long is because historically the market has been producing seven and a half percent per year return and that means a hundred dollars put in the market 20 years ago would be worth about 450 today a thousand dollars put in the market would be worth 4 500.""]"

going to show you how i know this using some basic logic using some basic math and then a little bit of a history lesson that i just learned about because before i did this i wanted to make sure are you sure claire are you sure you don't have any blind spots in your logic and not only are there not blind spots this statistic that i'm going to show you is just that much more compelling evidence that assuming the federal reserve does what it says it's going to do a recession is without doubt coming now in order for this to all make the most sense we need to understand how bonds work and just very very basic a simple relationship is this when bond prices go down so this is going to represent prices of bonds the relationship is this is that the interest rate associated with that bond goes up and we'll call that the ir for interest rate so one final time if bond prices go down interest rates go up and these interest rates are associated with car payments mortgage payments you know consumer debt credit card payments all that sort of stuff that is what is associated with this interest rate right here which again goes up if bond prices go down but what the federal reserve has been doing is this right here they've been sitting right here this blue line is representing the fed and they have been buying all sorts of bonds so you have all sorts of sellers that are showing up sellers here sellers here sellers here more sellers more sellers more sellers and with all this selling the price of bonds has barely fluctuated to the downside now why would the fed not want the price of bonds to go down hopefully you're saying well clay because that would mean that interest rates would go up and interest rates going up that can cause pain that causes mortgage payments to go up car payments to go up etc etc not to mention clay they've already been starting to raise interest rates which is true but this is a two-pronged attack and yes the fed has done prong number one which is just raising the federal funds rate just in other words raising interest rates but the other prong they have not yet even begun and what they've been doing is sitting here and buying buying buying and the fed is buying all that to prevent prices going down clay where are they getting all this money to keep buying and buying and buying well"", ""so how about this if this video gets 20 thousand likes in the first 24 hours I'll stop asking for it for the rest of the month so there we go thank you so much and now that said let's begin all right so in order to prepare for what's about to come it's first important to understand what type of downturn that we could see because despite what most people think there is a big difference between how you would approach a recession versus depression versus an all-out stock market collapse and to start we should talk about the elusive recession even though this is simply defined as two consecutive quarters of declining GDP the deeper you begin to look the more you begin to realize that this affects a lot more than just the headlines of CNBC and it's surprisingly a lot more common than you would expect after all since the 1940s we've seen a total of 18 recessions the longest lasting 18 months the shortest being about two months during the covet shutdown and since 1900 the average recession tends to last about 10 months with usually not so good effects for example the economic policy Institute found that throughout recessions we tend to see complete contraction throughout our economy including number one job losses as companies anticipate lower earnings they'll seek to reduce their costs and that usually begins with laying off employees to reduce their overhead two because of that we also tend to see declining wages a study in 2009 found that the average worker saw a six to seven percent income loss for each one percentage Point increase in the unemployment rate and even after 15 years the loss is still two and a half percent and three there tends to be less private investment just like businesses scale back individuals also tend to make smaller safer Investments and that in turn leads to less economic growth and less innovation in the future however when it comes to making money during a recession here's the good news"", ""so thank you guys so much and now with that said let's begin alright so before we talk about the best upcoming opportunities you first need to understand what you're going to be up against and to start we need to talk about a recession generally recessions are accompanied by a significant rise in unemployment a drop in wages a loss in consumer confidence and a decline in values across everything from stocks food energy and services with sometimes long lasting effects throughout the entire world but second along with the recession usually comes a decline in earnings see every quarter companies report the revenue and give guidance on their future outlook but lately they've been cutting forecasts bracing for slow or even negative growth inciting recession risks at the highest Pace in 10 years that leads us to third layoffs when consumers earn less they spend less and when companies see less demand they begin to scale back on their expenses with usually employees being the first to get let go in fact just a quick Google search for Mass layoffs shows you dozens upon dozens of companies who are are all trimming their Workforce and as Bank of America explains the U.S economy will soon start losing 175 000 jobs per month so in terms of what this means for you and your Investments as well as how you could use this information to make you money let's start here with number one stocks as of now all three major indexes are down between 20 and 30 percent with analysts like JP Morgan who believe that we have another 20 to go from current levels however if we take a look throughout history since 1946 the average bear Market drop was close to 30 percent with the most severe having been in 2009 when the S&P500 fell 57 from the peak now once you combine the average with the recession bear markets tend to do even worse with an average drop of 34.8 percent which just for reference right now we're down about 25 all of that is to say that generally the absolute bottom occurs when we see capitulation across investors usually that's a time of the start of the recovery and things begin to bounce back now I'll cover exactly how much you can make from this in the next few minutes but first we we have to talk about number two real estate even though every area is different and some locations might continue to flourish housing declines on a national level are actually incredibly rare in fact as you can see throughout the last 60 years there have only ever been a few times where prices meaningfully fell more than 10 percent but now the general Wall Street consensus is that National housing prices are going to decline seven percent with a worst case decline of 10 to 15 percent should interest rates continue to increase of course every Market is going to be different and according to Moody's Analytics the most vulnerable markets could see upwards of a 25 decline from the peak including parts of Florida Arizona Idaho and Southern California with the decline lasting another 12 to 18 months before bottoming out now in the big picture it's probably not going to make that big of a difference for anybody with a fixed rate mortgage who intends to stay in their property for another five to ten years but for anyone looking to invest or buy a house we may begin to see some deals starting to come on the market which we'll cover shortly because we have to also talk about third cash clearly up until now there's been this mindset that cash is wasting away to inflation but when every other asset is falling in price sometimes cash could be the safest place to store your wealth and you know that's significant when someone like the billionaire Ray dalio admits that cash is no longer trash the truth is many people forget that as recent as 2018 cash was the best performing asset and had you just been saving your money in a high-yield savings account you would have far outpaced the market cash is now becoming such a significant part of the portfolio that even fund managers are holding on to the highest amount of cash since 2001 and Citigroup said that cash is the only asset that investors could use as a recession hatch but as far as what you could do about this to make money and why so many people never take advantage of what's about to come here's what you need to know all right so in terms of why this next recession could be a once in a generation opportunity just to consider this first everything becomes less expensive the way I see it even though one person might think this is a bad time to invest everything is falling 30 percent a wealthy person would see this as an opportunity to be able to buy those exact same companies for a 30 discount Warren Buffett really had the perfect analogy for this he said when hamburger prices go down in price we sing when hamburgers go up in price we weep for most people it's the same thing with everything in life that they're buying except for stocks when stocks go down and you can get more for your money people don't like them anymore so first reframe your belief because a falling Market could work to your advantage the second there's less competition the fact is when times are difficult companies scale back they fold they can serve cash and they play it safe but this opens the door for smaller more aggressive companies to stand out and take their place for example one study across 16 000 companies found that those who continue to advertise increase their value and got more bang for the buck with Positive Growth years after the recession ended the third there's way more opportunity in a way a recession is the Market's method of weeding out the week and Patrick met David made a fantastic comparison a few months ago that the peak of the market cycle is exactly like a forest this means that only the largest most established trees or companies get access to all the resources or in this case sunlight everything at the bottom has a difficult time being able to compete and it's hard to grow but just like natural forest fires our economy has a way of repeatedly clearing out and bankrupting the companies who no longer are able to sustain themselves giving opportunities for newer smaller businesses to continue to develop and fourth after every bear Market comes a bull market as Yahoo finance points out historically the S&P500 has fallen an average of 29 around a recession with a median drop of 24 but once stocks have found their low their average return the following year is 40 percent and within two years the market has increased an average of 58 percent this means that investing in the way down is much more profitable than pulling out of the market and waiting and long term the market is always recovered in every single example so far throughout history and finally fifth you have to act before anyone else knows about it""]"

you so without further ado let's take a look at what whale movements can do to understand whale movements you need to be familiar with on-chain analysis so here's a quick crash course as you know most cryptocurrency blockchains are publicly viewable that means that anyone can see most crypto transactions happening in real time and this can easily be done using a blockchain explorer what's cool is that this level of transparency lets you do much more than just verify whether your transaction went through or not most blockchain explorers make it possible to rank wallet addresses based on how much of that crypto coin or token they hold some like etherscan.io do this by default now this is extremely useful because it can show you whether the supply of that coin or token is evenly distributed among its holders or whether there are just a few wallets holding most of the supply if the supply of a coin or token is heavily concentrated among a few wallets there's a big risk that one of those wallet holders could start to sell and this would crash the price of that coin or token blockchain explorers can even help you figure what people are doing with their cryptocurrency most blockchain explorers will label wallets belonging to centralized and decentralized exchanges this can give you a sense of whether people are trading or holding those coins or tokens if a significant amount of a cryptocurrency supply is sitting on exchanges it's likely that the people who hold that cryptocurrency aren't looking to do so for the long term if you can see that most of a cryptocurrency supply is being held often exchange this suggests that the people who hold that crypto don't plan on selling it anytime soon now some clever crypto traders have even gone as far as tracking down crypto wallets belonging to rich individuals and institutions this makes it possible to mimic the buying and selling behavior of smart money and sometimes makes it possible to spot and buy a hot 100x altcoin before it even makes the news these more elaborate on-chain tactics are much harder to do manually and that's why companies like glassnode and crypto quant exist on-chain analytics platforms combine price with on-chain data to create new indicators that often give you a much clearer view of the crypto market than technical analysis indicators and price patterns for example glassnode's hodl wave indicator shows you how much of bitcoin's supply has moved over a given time period when those darker hodl waves start to peak it means people are starting to sell as you can see the tip of those peaks corresponds quite nicely to previous bull market tops the only problem is that most of these advanced on-chain indicators cost thousands of dollars to use some of them even cost tens of thousands of dollars per year the good news is that many of the free on-chain metrics are just as good if you know how to use them correctly and this includes whale movements in a sentence a whale movement is a large cryptocurrency transaction insert your own joke about moby dick using the bathroom here it's a simple signal that can have a colossal effect on the price of a cryptocurrency depending on where that transaction is going when you see a cryptocurrency is being sent from a regular wallet to an exchange wallet on a blockchain explorer this means the person who sent that cryptocurrency probably wants to sell it this isn't a big deal when the transaction is small but if you see hundreds of millions of dollars of a cryptocurrency being sent from a wallet to an exchange that amount of cell pressure could crash the price conversely if you see that hundreds of millions of dollars of a cryptocurrency is being sent from an exchange and into a wallet whoever's behind that wallet is not planning on selling anytime soon if there are enough whale movements off exchanges and into wallets for a specific cryptocurrency this sudden reduction in market ready supply can be rocket fuel for positive price action the effects are reversed for these two whale movements when they involve stable coins if hundreds of millions of usdt or usdc are moving from a wallet to an exchange this means that whales are looking to buy and that could mean the market is about to pump if hundreds of millions of stable coins are moving off exchanges this means that whales don't plan on investing anytime soon and that could mean a temporary downturn or even a full-on bear market if you're wondering what those exchange to exchange whale movements are all about the answer is arbitrage in other words a whale is taking advantage of a small difference in price between two exchanges and because they have so much capital that small difference offers a sizeable return in dollar terms the last type of whale movement is wallet to wallet transactions and these are probably the most misunderstood of the bunch believe it or not most large investors don't use cryptocurrency exchanges this is because the large amount of crypto they're looking to buy or sell could stir up the market in the ways i just mentioned instead they do over-the-counter trading or otc otc allows big investors to buy or sell large amounts of cryptocurrency directly from an exchange or cryptocustodian at a fixed price when you're seeing hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency going between wallets it's probably an otc trade of some kind the thing is that you can never know for sure whether it was a purchase or a sale until after the fact now this is why tesla's purchase of bitcoin didn't affect the price of btc until they publicly announced it so what this means is that you don't have to pay too much attention to wallet to wallet whale movements since they typically have a negligible effect on price now in theory the transaction dynamics i just mentioned are all you need to know about whale movements and some of you might be familiar with everything i've said up to this point the thing is there are a few factors that can turn whale movements into a misleading signal and these are often overlooked by the average crypto trader the first factor relates to definition how large does a cryptocurrency transaction have to be for it to be classified as a whale movement"", ""[Music] before we get stacking there are some disclaimers that need unpacking if

ahead to any juicy topics you've found i'd love it if you watched from start to finish because the youtube algorithm gives lots of weight to your minutes that's enough of that let's get on with stacks staxx was founded in 2013 by computer scientists munib ali and ryan shea at the university of princeton stax is the product of munib's doctoral thesis which detailed a framework for an internet that could be built around the bitcoin blockchain this framework is called block stack and this was also the original name of the project until it rebranded to stacks in october last year the new york software company that developed stacks also rebranded from block stack pbc to hiro systems pbc and i'll explain why that's significant later on at the conceptual level you can think of stacks as being a layer 2 blockchain for bitcoin like the lightning network the stax blockchain also uses a novel consensus mechanism called proof of transfer that leverages bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus for security proof of transfer is conceptually similar to proof-of-stake as it involves stackers who stack the stx token on the stacks blockchain and earn bitcoin as a reward this bitcoin comes from stax miners who commit btc to the stax blockchain for a chance to mine a block on the stax blockchain and earn stx the btc they commit goes to stackers as stacking rewards the reasoning behind this consensus mechanism is that each btc coin essentially represents mining power from bitcoin's proof-of-work blockchain everything that happens on the stacks blockchain is verifiable on the bitcoin blockchain this doesn't modify or strain the bitcoin network because this information is just regular btc transactions made by stax miners in addition the stax blockchain is smart contract compatible and uses a specialized coding language called clarity that was created with the help of algorand instead of storing the data from its smart contracts on chain smart contract data generated by the stacks blockchain is stored off-chain in a decentralized storage system called gaia all data generated by a user on the stacks blockchain is assigned to their unique identity i.e their wallet address only the holder of the wallet address can access its associated data stored on gaia and give permissions to decentralized applications and third parties to do the same now this only scratches the surface of how stax works and if you want to take a closer look under the hood you can do just that by watching my first video about stacks and the link for that is as ever in the top right although the stax blockchain has technically been live since late 2019 it wasn't until mid-january this year that stacks became a finished product this was marked by the release of stax 2.0 which enabled proof of transfer mining and smart contract functionality on the stacks blockchain it turns out that how proof of transfer works in practice is pretty damn complicated but it seems to be lucrative for both miners and stackers to briefly recap the stx token has halving cycles similar to bitcoins for the first four years the block reward on the stacks blockchain is 1000 stx per block with the current market price of stx this works out to just over two thousand dollars per block plus any transaction fees in that block from the stacks blockchain now if my calculations are correct the amount of btc you'd need to commit to the stacks blockchain to minor block is currently about fifteen hundred dollars that's about a five hundred dollar profit in stx which is not too shabby that said the amount of btc that needs to be committed changes over time since the likelihood of getting chosen to minor block is proportional to how much btc you have committed relative to other minors moreover there is a

timestamps in the video timeline that you can use to get around if you're feeling stretched for time of course i'd appreciate it if you watch the whole way through because it will help this video get even more views forget your fud and fomo let's dive into the dip and all the things you need to know the first step to mastering the dip is understanding what it actually is in cryptocurrency the dip is defined as a sudden and sustained drop in price this is a vague definition because whether or not a cryptocurrency is dipping really depends on its general volatility during a bull run like the one we're in now it is normal for bitcoin's price to go up or down by five percent per day or go up or down by 10 or more on a weekly basis for all coins it's normal for their prices to change by more than 10 per day and they can easily gain or lose more than 20 of their value each week if this is the price action you see this means the crypto market is trading sideways and is in a no trend scenario in other words prices aren't really going up or down now if bitcoin suddenly drops by more than five percent in a day or an altcoin drops by more than 10 in a day this could mean a dip is beginning normally you'll know within a few days whether it is an actual dip or just extra market volatility if it is a dip this can signal one of two things a temporary correction in a bull market or a crash that results in a bear market naturally people who are bullish on cryptocurrency will generally adopt the correction narrative whereas those who are bearish on crypto will insist that it will crash down to zero the easiest way to check this for yourself is to pop open the price chart of the cryptocurrency you're looking at on coin market cap or coin gecko set the time frame to one year and try and spot a long term price trend now if you see that the price has been consistently trending up over the last year this dip is probably a temporary correction if it looks like the price is trending down or has reversed from an uptrend to a downtrend in recent months this dip could be the beginning of a long-term crash as you can see bitcoin's recent dip was nothing more than a temporary correction on a longer term uptrend bitcoin has had around four major corrections so far since the bull run began last spring and all of them have been within the 30 range to put things into context corrections in bitcoin's previous bull runs were usually over 50 the reason why they're not as extreme this time around is probably because institutional investors and experienced retail investors have been buying the dip bitcoin's volatility has also been declining over time as adoption increases and the mass adoption we've seen just over the last few months means it's very unlikely that bitcoin will be crashing anytime soon now you can learn all about that by watching my recent video about coingecko's quarterly crypto report link is hanging up there in the top right so now that you know what the dip is and how to spot it the next step is to figure out what could be causing it this is important to know if you're trying to buy the dip because looking at the price charts alone might not give you enough context to make the right call for example if one of your favorite coins is crashing because it's turned out to be a scam no amount of technical analysis is going to help you buy that dip because it's just going to keep dipping by contrast if ethereum suddenly drops because there's news that miners are going to try and disrupt the network in protest of eip 1559 then clearly this will require a more elaborate buy-the-dip strategy the problem with identifying causes in crypto is that it's very rare that you can definitively point to a single factor usually there are multiple factors causing a dip and each of these often cause overlapping chains of events that can turn into a vicious feedback loop let's use bitcoin's recent dip as an example of what i mean by this as far as i can tell the dip in mid-april was caused by a barrage of bad news for starters on april the 15th turkey announced it would be banning cryptocurrency payments now this probably spooked quite a few new investors who might have gotten the impression from certain news outlets that this is the beginning of some larger movement by governments to ban cryptocurrency since cryptocurrency investors are located around the world not all of them got this news at the same time within about 24 hours all the newbies knew what was up and their panic selling was in full force the sudden drop in price this course resulted in reckless traders using too much leverage getting liquidated on futures exchanges in plain english the btc these traders used as collateral to borrow from exchanges to execute these risky trades was automatically sold onto the open market this is what caused that huge wick you see on the bottom of the big red candle on the bitcoin chart for april the 17th in this case the wick was created by all the traders who had set buy orders for btc in that price range these orders were filled by all the btc being sold from over-leveraged traders prices stabilized for a couple of days and then dropped again when the news came out that the current u.s administration was looking to increase corporate and capital gains taxes an increased corporate tax would mean less profit and less profit translates to lower stock prices for all the affected companies an increased capital gains tax would mean that any wealthy investors who have already cashed out some of their gains this year will probably need to sell more assets to pay for the taxes on those gains the combined effect of both factors led to a dip in both the stock market and the cryptocurrency market where it again triggered liquidations from over-leveraged traders though to a lesser degree now i have to stress that this is a simplified explanation of the causes and chains of events behind the recent dip and there were probably way more moving parts at play in the background now if you want to get a closer look at why bitcoin pumps and dumps you can watch my video about that by using the link in the top right now that you know what the dip is how to spot it and all the factors that cause it the next step is to understand how this relates to altcoin dips as many of you already know all coins are highly correlated to bitcoin now this is important to remember during dips because no amount of bullish news can save your altcoin if bitcoin is in free fall sometimes there are exceptions to this rule but i have yet to see a single altcoin that has sustained its price across multiple bitcoin dips not even stable coins more importantly remember that whenever bitcoin dips altcoins will usually dip harder this is because in the context of cryptocurrency bitcoin is seen as the safe haven and altcoins are seen as risky investments you can track how money is moving between bitcoin and altcoins using the bitcoin dominance chart as you can see bitcoin dominance spiked during the recent dip however as with price you can see that the longer term trend is towards lower bitcoin dominance aka more money moving into altcoins this means that whenever bitcoin dips and decimates all coins the profits you'll get from buying the dip will be even larger for all coins this is because they will rebound much more aggressively than bitcoin once it finishes dipping and btc dominance returns to its downtrend case in point during the relief rally last weekend bitcoin went up by about seven percent whereas many altcoins went up by 15 or more pro tip don't be discouraged if your altcoin doesn't pump right away after the market is done dipping if you can see that your altcoin has been in a visible uptrend on the one year time frame it's probably a matter of time before that pump comes your way you can get a sense of when that pump might happen and how high it could take your favorite alt by using technical analysis now technical analysis is much easier to do than you think and this cryptochamp happens to have a beginner's guide in my introvid 2 ta now that you know what the dip is how to spot it and all the factors that cause it and how it impacts the altcoin market the last step is to measure how low the dip could go again a lot of this will depend on the factors that are causing the dip and there is no way of knowing for sure where the bottom of the dip actually is however there are no shortage of tools you can use to estimate how deep a dip could get and all of these can be found on the trading terminals of your favorite cryptocurrency exchanges if the entire crypto market is dipping then your main area of focus should be the btc usd chart even if you don't hold any btc this is because of that bitcoin altcoin relationship i mentioned moments ago start by going full screen removing all the indicators and setting the time frame to weekly this will give you some perspective about what could happen in the market in the medium term the first thing to look for is any price zones that could serve as support if the price were to fall any further in this case it's quite clear that the 49k range is a strong zone of price support for btc next enable the ema indicator this stands for exponential moving average and it helps identify any other zones that could serve as support that aren't immediately apparent in this case the ema suggests that if btc were to drop again the next zone of support would be around 42k this means that if you wanted to buy that dip you'd be trying to buy somewhere around that 42k range remember that the price could drop slightly below this level because of things like liquidations if this dip were to happen it would correspond to a 20 drop you can measure this using the ruler icon in the trading view tab of the trading terminal on the binance exchange full tutorial to use this exchange is in the top right by the way because altcoin losses can be almost twice as big as bitcoin losses during a dip this would translate to a 30 to 40 percent dip for your altcoin holdings so now that you know what the bearish scenario is in the medium term you can get a better sense of what to expect in the short term by using the daily time frame the daily time frame typically offers the best vantage point for buying the dip as with the weekly time frame the first thing to look for is visible signs of support the way to spot these zones of support is by looking at where prices have clustered in the past and this is often much easier to do on the daily time frame as you can see here the 49k range is showing itself as a strong zone of support and the next level below that seems to be around 46 to 47 k""]"

are entering a 10 times leveraged position with a margin of 100 meaning that you enter a total position of 1 000 should the price of the asset you're trading on go down to 10 that would be covering your entire margin that means that if the price goes down any lower it would be eating into the borrowed funds and not into the margin any sane lender would not risk their assets on your behalf so your position is liquidated to be able to have the needed funds to repay the lending party and your position is closed liquidation in this manner usually does incur fines and given that you can lose more money than you initially invest these can be relatively risky you can see how leveraged trading works here the amplification effect does work both ways as you amplify your losses as well leading to the possibility of going over your margin and you can be at risk of liquidation now let's look at derivatives and the typical types of derivatives in short a derivative is a financial asset with a value that is derived from an underlying asset or a group of assets whatever asset is used as a reference point the core concept is that the derivative product derives its value from it a futures contract is a type of derivative that lets you speculate on the price of a given asset at a later date you basically say that a given asset will be at a certain fixed price at a later date and take a position on it short or long a short position is when an investor buys an asset with plans to sell it at a later predefined contract price while a long position means entering a contract to buy the underlying instrument at the contract price at expiration"", ""but we want to make up to 500 per day so now you have to learn how to properly uh use leverage and derivative trading so here on the derivatives trading page on buy bit on the right side is where you can start trading Bitcoin um you have the option to select between isolated or cross margin an isolated margin applies um a predetermined margin to a position that can be adjusted manually if a liquidation occurs you may lose the initial margin as well as any additional margin added to the position on the other hand with cross margin all available balances in the associated margin account are utilized to meet maintenance margin requirements and avoid liquidation however in the event of liquidation all corresponding available balances may be lost so this will be very important to understand so please pause the video and go back 15 seconds to learn exactly what I just said here if you have followed my YouTube channel for some time if you're one of those one of my subscribers you should have noticed that I usually use isolated margin in my trades this allows you to select the desired leverage when using your utbot strategy which can result in Faster gains and more profits however it is important to know that isolated margin also carries a risk The Leverage could be set as high as 100x but definitely don't go 100x that is just massive risk it's it's stupid risk and if you're a beginner you should not even go above 5x usually I go up to like 25x myself but that's because I'm an experienced Trader I've been doing it now for five years so if you know what you're doing if you're an advanced Trader I will allow you to choose your leverage yourself it is very important always guys to have your stop loss and they take profit in place no matter what strategy you are using all right"", ""and then they're going to fold the unit up shrink wrap it and send it out the door how many times could this be

unfolded countless times but the idea is that these are kind of permanent buildings that are you know Superior to other traditional permanent buildings but just by their nature they are totally

declining operating margin there net income 550 529 million versus 689 that's worrisome but if you're going to have an operating margin go down that much your net income's likely going to fall that

faster now okay so if you look at their latest quarter as far as percentages they're all getting far worse than what the year over year numbers were for the full year fiscal year okay if you look at

okay"", ""but it's great for taking a general consensus but they are reporting it at 4:17 probably higher than the 402 numbers specifically because it may have been updated after the earnings report but in any case this is another resource that you can use but since we're analyzing this stock in sort of a pre earnings way so we could see in hindsight how we could have taken advantage of the earnings report before it came out we're going to act as if this earnings report never happened and with that in mind we're going to set the monkey support level to 402 back to the chart to plot this now you may quickly notice that the monkey line of support is so high that it's not even on the chart that is fine the higher the monkeys are projecting the stock to go the more sheep investors that are going to help us earn a profit buying into stocks that have massive expectations is better than buying into stocks that everyone thinks are going to crash because as we know in the short run the market is dictated by the opinions of the masses and not the actual underlying value of course in the long run stocks tend to converge to their real value but in the short run and we have fluctuations where people are like I don't know what value this is the real reason the monkey line of support is so important is because it is usually at a price point that is extensively generous since monkeys will be monkeys of course and the reason this is good is because if we know that the monkey level of support line is trading below us that means that our position is a lot more risky if the price action is she trading above it say if the monkey line support was at 300 instead of 400 then we need to be more worried about a negative earnings report or negative news catalysts since the analysts and chief investors are expecting a sell-off and this sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy but the point that I want to get across is that the Maki line support is not so much something that you should use as a actual support line as we think of technical support resistance but rather as a bearing to see where the average monkey is predicting the future price point to be at if you were swing trading you ideally want the monkey level of support to be higher than any technical resistance level now with that being said and just to be completely clear do not take monkey level of support as any indication of what is going to happen to the share price use it only to profit off the fluctuations caused by sheep investors as well as understanding the general consensus when it comes to earnings and overall reports so that you could protect yourself when you're holding swing positions when it comes to earnings and bad news the monkeys may be monkeys but odds are strong that they will have a better idea overall as a general consensus of many monkey firms as compared to you that only has Google and some guy that you watch on YouTube that spends all this time calling analysts monkeys that being said Moe keys are generally over emotional with their target prices or biased on the sector that their firm tends to focus on so you are going to want to find them the average of all of them together like I showed earlier to get a better feel of the monkey support line and overall monkey expectations"", ""and they absolutely positively obliterated I mean absolutely obliterated those numbers in such a shocking manner that throw out any forward P metrics you have for the stock any forward price to sales metrics because they're completely irrelevant now at this point in time folks

the items that consumers want we've seen this in the news lately none more so than in Australia where Coles and Woolies have got a huge monopoly so some estimates now that they control you know liquor

lightning networks if you haven't already to get your head around that concept of off chain side channel technology now so far we've seen decreed Verte coin like winning bitcoins successfully achieve atomic swaps on chain but in the future we will move to a model with seguir in the lining network but this is all going to happen even more instantly privately and with lower fees so at the moment if you want to exchange three different crypto currencies you have to use an exchange or shape-shift or some third party intermediary and what this is gonna do is basically allow for two users to agree which cubed own currencies they're going to swap at a set price and through the use of hash time lock contracts it's going to set a time period and if the trade is not executing that time period that funds will be returned to the individual users now this also utilizes multi-seat wallet technology and all that means is that both users require the other users key to unlock their side of the transaction and access their funds so once this is all locked in that contract the Bitcoin user or the litecoin user can send across the funds and that also sends across the key and as the instant that the litecoin user accesses that fund it also sends their key through the their channel to the other user and that allows them to instantly access their funds and this mechanism basically turns this into one transaction rather than two separate transactions and that's why this is so safe and secure so I hope I've explained that clearly please hit like subscribe if you haven't already share

open any accounts we want to make sure that our funds are secure so please download the Google Authenticator app on your phone that's going to generate a unique pin number each time you log into these exchanges so that if you happen to lose your username and password or get hacked your funds are still secure they can't login so we need to get verified on these exchanges and that's because of the anti money laundering and know your customer policies so this can be frustrating it can take a day or two so make sure you get your driver's license passport and utility bills on hand so these

up about 40 percent now while it's true that open AI you know the people behind chat are not owned by Microsoft Microsoft is a significant shareholder in that business originally Microsoft signed a one billion dollar deal with open AI back in 2019 becoming open ai's exclusive technology partner and then earlier in this year they extended that partnership with a further 10 billion investment which prompted openai co-founder Elon Musk to practically admit the open AI are effectively controlled by Microsoft at this point and while the success of chat GPT hasn't meaningfully impacted Microsoft's Financial results the market is already jumping on board and pricing the future of AI into Microsoft stock and interestingly these developments have also prompted Bill Gates to get back

sat down with a dinner with Bill Gates where Bill City thinks Microsoft actually has an Unstoppable lead in AI so a very interesting anecdote but of course nothing that we as value investors should necessarily be reading too much into what we should be more focused on of course is their core business because remember at its heart Microsoft has numerous software businesses which have gotten it to

current and p e ratio is just 17.68 compared to a 22.89 average for the rest of the S&P500 companies these guys have the strongest balance sheet in Corporate America super high profit margins yet in 2022 they went from 151 dollars to the low sad price of 87 that was a Monumental 45 percent drop for a company that had returned 25 percent returns for over a decade from a fundamental view it's my

world their PE is a little bit high at 24.24 that's a bit higher than the rest of the S&P500 in my opinion there is a room there's a little room for that to come down still but why are we even comparing a two percent market share being with Google well because even though Google is a giant today perhaps they have more to lose than gain and with the rise of AI Microsoft they may be quietly making a move on that number one spot the CEO Satya Nadella if I pronounce that correctly has promised to transform Bing to position themselves as the future leader of search they dropped a billion dollars into artificial intelligence in 2019 by buying the company open AI these guys are the Builders of chat GPT which has been the fastest growing software in the last decade this move was a Hail Mary nothing to lose pass Bing would either Thrive or die and chat GPT is free and it's losing millions of dollars a week and they couldn't be happier I want you guys to check out this video to better understand what chat GPT is it took Netflix more than three years to reach 1 million users but it took chat GPT just five days techies everywhere short circuiting with excitement OMG chat GPT is about to make my life 10 times easier but what is it chat GPT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model developed by open AI it is specifically designed for conversational language and is capable of generating responses to input in a way that mimics human conversation that description by the way comes from chat GPT itself we asked think of it as Google but with more human-like features plus it's free you can ask a very specific question like give me five tips for how to use my camera are you going to ask it to write a poem or a play or a song it really can kind of comprehend almost any request and then it spits out language that sounds like it was written by human being we also asked it to write this entire script which it did but it didn't take into account that we need our expert to weigh in a lot of the headlines are that this might make Google obsolete do you see that possibly becoming reality if I were Google I would be a little bit nervous just because this interface sort of the thing that everybody has funded forever I mean this this is the closest thing I was saying to like the Star Trek computer um where you say what you want and it responds instantly For Better or For Worse many educators are already worried about how chat GPT might become a surrogate student when it comes to homework kids could use this to grade something which a teacher could probably not identify as not having been written by human non-students can use chatgpt for other tasks here's Chachi PT drafting an email to my bosses asking for a raise open AI the company behind chat GPT says it's using this technology responsibly the bot won't answer any salacious questions for example but this is only the beginning where is this going to go you know what I mean are we going to have this thing filling out like dating profiles now am I going to fall in love with chat GPT""]"

the moving average will pop up over here we then want to be going into the settings because we get different moving averages out there we will be having a more strategized video on using a strategy on

lower band factoring by the standard deviations around the moving average the moving average line moves closer to the upper band it typifies an overbought market state the other situation indicates an

momentum via overbought and oversold states which are illustrated by two lines across the chart usually assigned from default values 70 percent were overbought and 30 oversold in theory when rsi line crosses the upper or lower line it blows a whistle does the market buying or selling orders are too much then the trend is probably going to rebound and push the price back to the balance level hence when you see the market is in an overbought state the rsi goes below 70. it is the signal to sell on the opposite when the market is oversold the rsi exceeds 30"", 'hello and welcome this is an overview of the standard deviation the standard deviation is a measurement of the rate of dispersion or volatility around an average or expected value of a set of random data the standard deviation shows how tightly clustered around or how spread out a set of data is from the mean or average of that data in other words if one takes an average of a set of random data such as the periodic daily returns of an asset the standard deviation shows how spread out or scattered the data is from that mean the standard deviation is sometimes referred to as the measurement of the scatter and although not completely accurate the standard deviation is also sometimes referred to as the average distance away from the average the symbol for the standard deviation is the Greek letter Sigma which is a circle with a little line extending to the right the standard deviation creates a range around the mean such that a certain percentage of the data falls within the range and a certain percentage lies outside of the range on a set of random data a range of one standard deviation around the mean contains about 68% of the data in other words about 68% or about two thirds of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean furthermore if we double the standard deviation then the range around the average is two standard deviations above and to below this range will contain about 95% of the data in other words about 95% of the data will be within two standard deviations of the mean if we increase the range to three standard deviations above and three below about 99% of the data will fall within that range in other words about 99% of the data will be within three standard deviations of the mean this is known as the empirical rule we can use multiples and frac of the standard deviation to figure out a range for any percent of the data we can then use this to calculate out the probability or odds of the future event occurring which we will cover more in later videos in finance historical volatility is the standard deviation of the periodic returns in most cases the historical volatility of an asset is the standard deviation of the periodic daily returns over one year this is the rate of change that the stock went up and down each day not the dollar amount that the stock changed in price which is a common error often made so in short the historical volatility of an asset is the standard deviation of the periodic daily returns over 1-year period when the data is more spread out for instance when a stock price has large gains and losses each day it means that the stock has more volatility in other words it means it has a larger standard deviation when the data fluctuates up and down less it means the stock has lower volatility or a smaller standard deviation standard deviation is used in probability calculations the average of the data and the standard deviation of the data are the two inputs used to create a normal distribution curve standard deviation is also used to measure risk in return such as mean variance optimization which is used in Modern Portfolio theory to determine asset allocation based on risk and return standard deviation also has many other uses that go beyond the scope of this video it is a useful tool in many aspects that are well worth studying so that is an introduction to the standard deviation in the next video we will cover the math involved in calculating out the standard deviation however I will mention ahead of time that the standard deviation function is built right into Excel and Google Docs so while it is good to understand the math behind the calculations one never has to actually do the calculations by hand see you in the next video']"

talk about is the price to book ratio and the price to book ratio is again a fairly easy to get kind of metric for most companies if you look up a business on something like yahoo finance search the stock ticker and look up some key statistics you'll pretty much always see a price to book ratio and this is one of those metrics that is really really useful for some businesses and not so useful for other businesses so let's first describe what the price to book ratio is again just like the p e ratio we have a price factor and we're dividing that by some other number in this case book value now book value is simply the assets of the company minus any of the liabilities so if the business owns a bunch of buildings and a bunch of intellectual property for example those are all assets if they have some long-term debt then that would be a liability so you take the assets you take away the debt and the kind of net amount that equity that you are left with is what's called book value in accounting terms so when you look at a price to book ratio if you see a price to book ratio of less than one you're basically seeing a business that is trading for less than that book value uh you can buy it for half of sort of the net worth of that company for example if the book value was 0.5 or if the book value was something like 3 for example you're paying many multiples of sort of the net worth that is built into the balance sheet of that company now like i said earlier there are some businesses where the price to book ratio is really useful and other businesses where the price to book ratio is really a complete waste of time and it basically comes down to looking at how that particular company earns money now if the business is in some sort of industry where the amount of assets that that company has basically directly controls the amount of income and earnings that that business generates that's a situation where the price to book ratio can be quite useful so a classic example here is something like a real estate business now a real estate businesses income is basically entirely driven by how much real estate the company has there's really no way that a real estate company can go ahead and earn a really dramatically higher amount of income without increasing the asset value in its portfolio increasing the book value in that company so things like real estate companies things like farms things like banks or insurance companies those are all industries where the assets of the company hugely dictate the amount of money that those businesses can earn and for that reason the price to book ratio is a metric that's really useful when you're analyzing those companies at least on a surface level before you do a deep dive into some of those companies so if you come across a real estate company for example or a bank or insurance company and you see that the price to book ratio is well below one it's trading at far less than the book value or the uh equity value of that company then that is something that may be of more interest to you and something that is potentially undervalued but there are a wide range of businesses where the amount of assets that they have does not necessarily dictate how profitable those companies are going to be and these are companies that can quite rationally be priced at many multiples of their book value so a company like apple for example comes to mind apple can increase their profitability by selling new services or increasing the price of their iphones or selling more iphone units are really without spending a whole bunch of money on creating new assets so apple coca-cola microsoft any business that really is brand heavy and produces a large amount of money on a relatively small asset base those are the types of businesses where the price to book ratio is really not particularly useful uh as the businesses profitability is really not dictated by the amount of assets that are sort of on that company's balance sheet in terms of how i use this metric personally basically if it's one of these businesses that produces a lot of profit on a relatively small asset base and it's really not the asset size that dictates their profitability that's the type of business where i will just completely ignore the price to book ratio but if it's a business where the assets are sort of the main driver of how profitable that company becomes over time uh then that is a situation where i will be far more interested in the price to book ratio and really what i'm looking for is if it's in and around one or especially if it's below one uh that is a situation again where it's not necessarily guaranteed to be undervalued but it's a situation where i'm able to say that this business could potentially be undervalued it's possibly trading below intrinsic value and it certainly warrants more digging from me as an investor now the third and final metric that we're going to talk about in this video is ev to ebit which is sometimes referred to as the acquirers multiple because of this book the acquires multiple where they talk about eve but and basically uh really interestingly if you had simply just bought the lowest ev ebit stocks in the stock market consistently over a long period of time you actually would have produced a 17.5 percent compounded return from 1973 through to 2017 compared to about 10.2 percent on the S&P500 and that was basically the topic of this book by tobias carlile the acquirers multiple"", ""AS of the end of December eyd offered a lower valuation level than its

listeners who are curious about the construction of this type of Fund in short we begin with a broad Universe of stocks of a suitable market capitalization that also passed liquidity and price requirements next we select the stocks in the top 20 percent of that Universe by yields across dividends net BuyBacks we apply some valuation Ensemble across a number of factors some of the ones we discussed previously we referenced five of them earlier in this podcast for example we further shrink the universe by isolating the top shareholder yield stocks registering higher debt retirement with low financial leverage those are both quality metrics we also seek to avoid value traps by doing a final sort based on momentum indicators it can be an exhausting process but we believe it's worth it

rate of interest on our usdc loan we are accruing interest at a rate of about 7.42 percent if we take an equivalent amount of assets and we know it's equivalent because we just took this amount and swapped for this asset and then put it into a pool where it's earning More Than This asset so long as this discrepancy Remains the Same we should never have to worry about liquidation now should the rate of return for atom decrease and or the rate of usdc interest increase that situation could change finally we're left with a deposit balance greater than the amount of assets that we started with

a lending protocol let's take a look at that next over on Soul end with msol and St Soul Assets Now on our wallet we can deposit both of these into the lending contract selecting the max amount will deposit all of the M sold that we've just created taking a look at Soul scan we can see how much gas we are needing to pay for these types of transactions here we see that it is way under one sole per in fact it looks like we could perform as many as a thousand transactions without exceeding one's Soul definitely a very cost effective ecosystem at the current block space demand we're turning again to Soul end we can contribute our St soul that we just created as well coming up next we're going to take a usdc loan against the assets that we're holding on Solan The Hope here is that we don't need to aggressively monitor our usdc position because our staked assets are earning interest on the back end and therefore becoming more valuable if our collateral becomes more valuable at a rate faster than our interests that were accruing on the loan then we don't need to worry about paying it back anytime soon selecting usdc then the borrow button at the top and an amount of fifteen dollars we can borrow 15 usdc through the protocol finally scrolling down we can see our current asset positions including some positions we set up previously but the two we just set up are right here along with the loan position we just accessed with usdc in our wallet we're ready to participate in some leveraged trading but to do this we need a leveraging protocol scrolling down to the options listed by defy Lama for Solana we do come across one labeled derivatives and that's drift here on drift we see a trading interface rather similar to what we saw when working with GMX before as you can see we have access to leverage positions here via slider as well as standard trades now in order to participate in trading on drift we do need to deposit our assets to the protocol depositing the assets does incur a fee but once they're deposited we can proceed with our leveraged trading options here we have specific leverage options based on the amount of assets we've deposited to our wallet as we can see our maximum Leverage is 10x which would allow us an 150 dollar position based on the 15 and collateral that we've deposited this is a bit strong for what we want to execute right now instead we're going to favor that same 5x position that we did in testing the other day selecting long we're able to set up our long position and here we can see that our current liquidation price on this position is 23 953 should we drop that far then we will be liquidated and lose our collateral assets however should the price increase then we're going to see that leverage working in our favor well there you have it a complex yet reasonable strategy for diversifying sole assets on Solana and producing a Bitcoin long position using entirely permissionless means it's a great solution for anybody who's looking for a censorship resistant alternative to something like buybid now that they've introduced kyc other options can also be explored with leveraged trading including incorporating different asset strategies and things of that nature of course be careful and watch your liquidation prices if you're going to execute strategies that way however it's clear to see that there's a lot of opportunity still available on Solana as we enter the next Bull run nobody really knows what's going to happen with total value locked across all these different chains the truth is we may see Solana

68,67,35,67_oil_prices_chevron_commodity,"['oil', 'prices', 'chevron', 'commodity', 'demand', 'energy', 'supply', 'capital', 'companies', 'buffett']","[""and I don't want to get into the Weeds on that too much other than to say there's not a whole lot of political motivation to go out and encourage oil companies to continue to to explore for new oil and find more oil and produce more oil it's very much the opposite direction and that kind of has a lot of downward pressure on Supply and potentially you know the flying effect of that is you know pushing oil prices up at least in the short term the other part that comes into it pretty significantly is simply investors having been burned through previous commodity Cycles if we look back at something as simple as the Occidental Petroleum stock chart from the early 2000s we'll see that oxy was ripping upwards and something similar was happening on a lot of oil companies not only in the US but in many parts of the world through that time and the core thing that oil investors were really looking for at the time was growth you know it was all about growth and exploration and finding more oil and after oil peaked in 2007 a lot of investors were really burned and if you listen to basically any investor call from an oil company these days there's very few of them talking about new oil exploration and looking to grow capacity almost all of them are instead focused on things like sheer repurchases and dividends so you have this really interesting Dynamic where Oil demand does continue to steadily track upwards over time and there's politics and capital allocation and potentially pushing the supply of oil down or at the very least slowing it from growing as fast as it might have done historically now Buffett has shared thoughts on oil investing a few times over the years something you said in 2020 was when you buy into a huge oil production company how it works out is going to depend on the price of oil to a great extent it's not going to be your geological home runs or super mistakes or anything like that it's an investment that depends on the price of oil"", ""so you're asking oil companies to further lower what makes you think that they are going to listen to an Administration that is ultimately trying to put them out of business how how is the administration trying to put them out of business well they produce fossil fuels and this President says he wants to end fossil fuel so look there's a couple of other things at play in terms of the investors and these oil companies firstly we've come out of a couple of really interesting phases of the oil cycle in 2007 and eight the last time that oil companies really rocketed up and oil prices were very high there was a lot of incentive for oil companies to grow and to deploy capital and finding more oil and that really caused quite a significant oversupply in the oil Market it meant that oil prices went down and really there were a lot of investors burned from encouraging companies to go through that exercise so there's been a real shift and if you listen to the likes of the Occidental quarterly conference calls you'll no longer hear them talking a lot about finding new oil and spending a lot of money on Capital expenditures to drill more Wells and so on uh you'll instead hear them talking a lot about debt repayment about sheer BuyBacks and about paying dividends to shareholders and finally there's some research that I covered in a previous video here on the channel that suggests that over the very long term if oil were to get below the say 40 to 60 dollar per barrel range it would really no longer be economic for most oil companies to exist so anything can happen in the short term with all sorts of commodity prices but that probably is some sort of very long-term floor for oil so to sum up where I think Buffett's head is probably out if I really had to guess I think there's probably two core factors really at play when he's investing in the likes of Occidental and Chevron I think firstly he probably has a view that oil prices stay higher for longer than most people anticipate and secondly I think he really likes the capital allocation taking place at these companies limited capital expenditure for growth and exploration and a lot of cash being funneled back towards shareholders through debt repayments dividends and share BuyBacks and to an extent I think that second capital allocation points probably reinforces the first point of oil prices Staying High if every company is just doing a bunch of sheer BuyBacks and paying dividends and no one's spending money on looking for new oil that is another kind of big constraint over the long term on oil supply now I recently actually got the chance to sit down and interview Jake Taylor who some of you may know from the value after hours podcast he's also the CEO of Farnam Street Investments and the author of The Rebel allocator the full podcast episode with Jake will be going live probably later this week on the investing with Tom podcast YouTube channel on and on all audio platforms as well and I just want to play a clip of something that Jake said in that podcast episode really exactly on some of the points I've been discussing in this video like I'm very hopeful that Humanity will make the transition from hydrocarbons to more renewable sources of energy and I think we will get there eventually I just think it's going to take a long time and as an investor if everyone thinks it's going to take a short time and you think it's going to take longer that that has often been a pretty good bet to make is that things take longer than than everyone thinks now we all know that Warren Buffett is a value investor anytime he's looking to buy into a particular company and oil is no exception he's looking to buy that business below its intrinsic value and he actually mentioned specifically in the 2007 annual shareholder meeting for Birch Hathaway uh how he thinks about investing in oil companies he said if we are in an oil stock it's because we think it offers a lot of value at this price but it does not mean we think the price of oil is going up if we thought oil was going up we could buy oil Futures which we actually did once so how exactly does Warren Buffett calculate something like intrinsic value for an oil company because these businesses are very different from a apple or Microsoft or Costco which a very steady businesses that produce stable and growing amounts of cash flow and earnings oil companies are quite different they can be very very volatile and the earnings year to year are heavily influenced by the price of oil again I want to play another clip here from my interview with Jake Taylor where he presents a pretty nice idea of thinking about valuation with some of these very cyclical businesses I think I ideally in a in like that type of commodity company you would you probably like Buy on Price to Book and sell on PE so wait until you buy when the business isn't working assuming that you know that it's it's a cyclical Decline and not a secular Decline and that that is not always obvious uh so as you know a lot of people could attest to buying companies that they thought were just at a temporary dip"", ""well I'm not going to sit here and act like I can predict that and the short term nobody knows and in the short term there is really no floor or ceiling for what commodity prices can do and oil is absolutely no exception but in the long term there are a few things that I think are worth sharing now there's some really good research I kind of stumbled across from a guy called Gary Turner who is the CEO of Trove research and he published a really interesting study on basically Returns on equity and Returns on invested capital and Renewables and and oil companies and how that changes at different oil prices now the US is the largest producer of oil in the world and the Returns on equity and Returns on invested Capital that the companies and then you know of course the returns that investors can generate are going to be heavily dependent on the price of oil as Warren Buffett has just told us and uh This research from uh Gary Turner suggests that if oil were to stabilize in the 40 to 60 dollar Barrel range then the typical large U.S oil company would only earn about a four percent return on Capital and within that 40 to 60 dollar range those Returns on investor Capital actually changed quite dramatically uh at sixty dollar oil the average large U.S oil and gas company would earn about an eight percent return on invested capital and at forty dollar oil they would earn about a 1.3 return on invested Capital so all of that is to say that if oil were to get below say forty to sixty dollars a barrel in the very long term the US basically doesn't have a sustainable oil industry the returns will be too anemic to Warrant you know new Investments so that sort of puts potentially a longer term flaw on oil prices and you would think that over time the cost of production for oil will tend to go up we have that just through General inflation and asset prices and labor prices going up but we also have that through sort of the physical reality ways of finding oil you know all the easy oil has largely been sucked out of the ground already and oil companies are having to get sort of increasingly heroic and go further distances and so on to find new oil now in terms of a potential sealing price or upper limit for where Oil could go to there's a pretty famous saying in commodity businesses that the cure to high prices is high prices and that basically means that as commodity prices go up and companies start earning very high sort of super normal Returns on Capital that tends to encourage more people to produce that particular commodity and earn those super high Returns on Capital and that of course pushes prices back down again if it gets too extreme you have sort of the marginal producers of a particular commodity kind of pull back and restrain production and that's how you have these Epson flows and commodity prices over time but there are a few things that are potentially different this time and I know that is the most dangerous phrase and invest in but you have this very kind of political situation where producing more oil is very very frowned upon and you also have an investor base that is really demanding a capital return through dividends or BuyBacks having been burnt in a recent cycle add to that the fact again that oil will without doubt get harder to find over time I really don't know what the cln 2 oil prices could be now to sum up Buffett's investment case at an Occidental and Chevron I actually think it's very simple there's a lot of moving Parts here but I think there are really two core drivers behind this investment from Buffett firstly I think he probably has a view that long-term oil prices will be higher and they'll be higher for longer than most investors probably anticipate in many ways there is the structural mismatch between oil supply and oil demand and if those two things that I just said turn out to be correct they can really only mean one thing for oil prices which is that they have to go up the second thing that I think Buffett likes is that there is very little capital expenditure for growth he's getting a lot of his cash back very quickly through dividends and BuyBacks particularly when oil prices are as high as they have been recently oils come back a little bit in the past month but you know if we look at just the sheer amount of cash flow that companies like Occidental have been producing it's been pretty insane I mean oxy produced 4.2 billion dollars of free cash flow in their second quarter this year which is a six percent free cash flow yield just from that one quarters cash flow they also retired 4.8 billion in debt and purchase back 1.1 billion of stock""]"

will see you guys in the next video peace"", ""i want to tell you about a man named victor frankel victor frankel was an austrian jew who was captured by the german nazi party in 1942 and taken to a german death camp where he would lose his friends family and immediate relatives why am i telling you about victor frankel viktor frankl survived world war ii and he ended up becoming a world renowned neurologist partially due in part to what he learned in the camps viktor frankl learned while he was in the camps that he actually had far more freedom than the guards that were holding him captive what let me explain you see viktor frankl while he was under the boot of the german might in the mid-1940s realized what makes us human he finally realized the very essence of what makes us human in the first place and he realized that it's this the one thing the animals don't have is that the animals don't have the ability to control their response to stimulus what does that mean let me explain whenever something happens to you for example it's raining outside for example being brought to an internment camp for example being hit by someone and then them running off and leaving you in the dust you can't control the stimulus that comes into your life you can't control what happens to you but what you can control is your response we are able to take control of our response we are responsible we have responsibility we have the ability to respond and we can choose how we respond that's what he realized and what he ended up doing with that knowledge is he found out that the stimulus coming into his mind into his brain that of being in an internment camp did not have to determine what his response was going to be instead he had the ability the uniquely human ability to choose in between stimulus and response how he was going to handle the situation and so in a long stint in solitary confinement victor frankel came to realize that he actually had more freedom than the guards because the guards had been living under the false assumption that they were stuck to do whatever their captors the german nazi party told them that they had to do after the war viktor frankl went on again like i said to be a world-renowned austrian neurologist and you might be wondering jeb why in the world are you telling me about this random neurologist let me explain if you're in cryptocurrency you probably have felt very very strong emotions for example bitcoin and ethereum especially are doing very well this weekend my ethereum portfolio is higher now than it ever has been and my bitcoin portfolio is creeping back up there as bitcoin continues to rally and that can bring about a very visceral strong emotion in us i know you felt it and also on the flip side we can have a very strong and visceral emotion of fud whenever the market goes down here's the thing i want to teach you today this is going to be a pretty short video it's not that complicated whenever you have a stimulus whether that be bitcoin rallies or bitcoin declines you don't have to act on instinct your instinct when bitcoin goes down is to freak out your instinct when bitcoin goes up is to celebrate your instinct when bitcoin goes up might be to fomo into a trade that you didn't actually research and you weren't ready for you know this concept is well understood in gaming circles i'm a gamer by uh by childhood i've always played a lot of games for those of you guys who know it i played a lot of civilization stellaris i was just playing having a little bit of fun over the weekend kind of relaxing after a very long week we've worked like 80 hours this week it's a great great fun absolutely incredible best journey i've ever been on in my life another one minecraft great game but in league of legends there's a game called league of legends the pro community in league of legends they really understand this concept what they say is that if you go around blaming your teammates then number one you're being a bad teammate and you're probably not going to win by being a bad teammate but more importantly you're not going to be able to learn if it's always someone else's fault for example if i failed starting this youtube channel and i started blaming my dad or blaming my mom or blaming my parent my my school system or or blaming the government or blaming china or blaming barack obama or bill clinton or trump or someone or or blaming israel or blaming whoever if i if i start blaming people then what i do is i am giving them the authority over me i am taking that freedom that makes us uniquely human and i'm giving it to my captors if you will and that is what viktor frankl realized is that he actually has more freedom than many of the guards because he realized what made him uniquely human and therefore no matter what the stimulus coming into him was he was able to determine how he was going to respond because of that uniquely human attribute of freedom so you might be wondering jeb"", "" Gaby Lapera: In the vein of last week, when we gave our book recommendations, and this week, when were talking about good financial advice and people who had their head screwed on straight, do you want to talk about a book that you're reading, Maxfield? You were telling me about it this morning. John Maxfield: The book I want to talk about is a biography of a man named Stephen Girard. Stephen Girard was the richest American from roughly the year 1800 to the year 1831 when he died. And what's so remarkable about Stephen Girard is that not only did he beat all of the odds to become the richest man in America, but he also acted in an extremely, not only patriotic, but also a very kind way, despite his incredible wealth. Let me give you a few examples. He was born in France, and when he was born, he had a defective right eye that contemporaries described as grotesque.

'crypto', 'tokens']","[""but what's really interesting is two big things are happening in the market and they're affecting the way that i'm investing number one has to do with crypto and number two has to do with what the market actually thinks about inflation so let's talk about crypto first i believed that if we got an inflection to the downside two things would happen one cryptocurrencies would fall and technology stocks would go up that's what i believed i believe that cryptocurrencies would go down because cryptocurrencies uh a lot of folks invest in cryptocurrencies because they want an inflationary hedge this summer when used car prices were going down before inflecting back up when lumber prices were going down before inflecting back up when oil prices were going down before inflecting back up guess what cryptocurrencies were doing falling the 10-year treasury rate was low this summer it was down to like 1.25 and cryptocurrencies were low at the same exact time because inflation expectations were falling we thought that's it we're on trajectory the inflationary curve is going down but unfortunately the reason we got this curve down was in part due because of the delta variant in a very brief kind of slowdown and all of a sudden commodity prices started going up used cars lumber uh aluminum uranium every commodity essentially has been skyrocketing it said lithium you name it and now supply chain issues are even more strained under high product costs and shipping issues and port congestion is worse than it ever was before to where the port of los angeles and the port of long beach are going to a 24-hour shift to try to squeeze out another 60 hours of work a week just to try to get product moving it's nutty right"", ""so what's the solution then well easy answer actual cryptocurrencies that is digital currencies that are truly decentralized from top to bottom now the list of cryptocurrencies which meet this Criterion is very short and none of them could be called a currency per se their prices are way too volatile the good news is that this price volatility means you'll never see a government entity publishing a study about how the circulation of these cryptocurrencies needs to be limited because they compete with bank deposits the bad news is that this price volatility means they can't be used as currencies so what's needed then is a truly decentralized stable coin that can be used as a currency while there have been many attempts to develop such a currency so far they have all collapsed proponents of cbdc's and centralized stable coins alike have capitalized on these collapses to deter further development the Silver Lining is that this isn't going to stop crypto companies and crypto projects from trying to develop a truly decentralized stablecoin of some kind if Done Right the profits will be unprecedented this massive incentive will dare developers to try again and again regardless of the risks and the regulations with some luck we will see a truly decentralized stablecoin developed before it's truly too late and that is all for today's video folks so if you enjoyed it smash that like button to make sure you don't miss the next one subscribe to the channel and ping that notification Bell and feel free to share this video with others in the crypto Community as well the first step to solving any problem is to be informed after all and if you've been considering copying some crypto apparel getting your hands on a hardware wallet or creating an account on one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges well then check out our deals page in the description below we've got dozens of discounts and thousands of dollars of incentives for you with all that said thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next one this is guy over and out"", ""take note of whether the cryptos on your lists meet these minimum thresholds if you notice one of the cryptocurrencies you're considering has a remarkably low following compared to its ranking then there is a chance that a lot of the price action you're seeing is manipulation after all if there is hardly any community engagement then who the hell is doing all the trading shady price action is usually quite easy to spot on coin market cap and coin gecko dead giveaways are low trading volumes with sudden spikes and limited exchange support for reference most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 have 24-hour trading volumes in the billions or at least the hundreds of millions those in the top 200 have 24-hour trading volumes in the hundreds of millions or at least the tens of millions now again take note if you see any abnormalities here for the cryptos you're considering once you've established that the cryptos you're examining have a decent amount of social engagement that isn't just hype the next step in your triage is to check supply sources and demand drivers broadly speaking there are two supply sources in cryptocurrency inflation and vesting i.e the unlock periods for any coins or tokens allocated to private investors or the team behind the crypto project if we're being technically accurate almost every single cryptocurrency on the market has some amount of real inflation even if it has a maximum supply since new coins or tokens are being created every day most cryptocurrencies have levels of inflation that range from five to ten percent others such as tokens you earn from yield farming and d5 can have annual inflation rates in the hundreds of percent inflation isn't really a problem if you're only planning on holding a cryptocurrency for a few weeks or months you can also sometimes offset that inflation while you wait to sell by staking that coin or token however inflation can have some serious implications when you couple it with a vesting schedule and this is something that is often overlooked by even the most experienced crypto investors as i discussed in my video on tokenomics most cryptocurrencies we see today were pre-mined meaning the founders created some or all of the supply of that cryptocurrency in advance usually only a very small percentage of that initial supply is sold to retail investors like you and me with the rest going to venture capitalists private investors and the team behind the project this is why most cryptocurrencies have a low circulating supply and you can usually check how that cryptocurrency was initially allocated using ico drops or massari the coins or tokens allocated to private parties usually have a lengthy unlock period to prevent everyone from selling too soon after the coin or token starts trading because it would crash the price while vesting schedules come in all shapes and sizes the main thing to look out for is any large vesting cliffs because this sudden release of tokens in such a short period of time often suppresses price action using polygons matic token as an example we can see that its price seems to have stagnated in the first week or two after each vesting cliff as private investors sell some of their unlocked tokens the worst part is that many cryptocurrency projects allow their initial investors to stake their coins or tokens while they are vesting in other words they are earning inflationary rewards while they wait in some cases these coins or tokens have been vesting for years and sometimes the inflationary rewards from staking began accumulating well before that crypto even began trading on the market this can turn an initial allocation of 10 million tokens into an actual allocation of 12 or 15 or even 20 million tokens by the time they're unlocked when that vesting cliff comes a crash could come with it if you see a coin or token on your wish list that has a high inflation schedule coupled with an aggressive vesting schedule wherein staking was possible you might want to count it out that is unless it has strong demand drivers while there are multiple demand drivers in cryptocurrency two of the most powerful are use case and institutional demand in terms of use case btc's primary use case is as a store of value whereas eth's primary use case is to pay for gas fees on the ethereum network the robustness of the bitcoin network and the size of ethereum's ecosystem is why there is a constant demand for both even if the cryptocurrencies you're considering have high inflation and aggressive vesting schedules it is very possible that the demand for some of them could be high enough to overcome that supply shock polygons matic token is again a good example of this even with vesting matic has been flying lately and that's because people want to use ethereum dapps with cheaper fees on its layer 2 blockchain now if you're lucky some of the cryptocurrencies you're considering might be on the radar of institutional investors like retail investors institutional investors are starting to get more comfortable with altcoins and have been getting exposure through various exchange-traded products like greyscale's crypto trusts grayscale has been buying up billions of dollars of cryptocurrency on behalf of its clients and it's currently in the process of getting confirmation for almost a dozen more trusts i'll leave links to a few of those trust filings in the video description so that you can check if one of your crypto picks is on the list pro tip be aware that many crypto projects will shill their institutional connections and partnerships even though they have no practical effect on their coin or token do extra research for these claims when examining the cryptocurrencies on your list ask yourself if there are any use cases beyond speculative retail investing that could push up the price of those coins or tokens ideally the demand coming from the use case should be real something long-term and not due to a short-term incentive of some kind once you've identified those use cases you have to honestly ask yourself whether there are other crypto projects competing in that niche that are doing a better job or could do a better job in my experience some of the best cryptocurrencies are those that have a practical use case in a small niche without much competition travala's ava token comes to mind here anyways the problem with most cryptocurrencies that have a strong use case or institutional investment is that they have seen most of their growth for this bull market so this brings me to the final factor you need to keep in mind assuming the cryptos left on your list have high social engagement with minimal hype and demand drivers that outweigh its supply sources the last thing to check for is growth potential now let's start with a reality check the bull market technically began in may last year and we have anywhere between four to eight months left before this one is over unfortunately most cryptocurrencies have gone up by 10x or more already on the bright side though even large cryptocurrencies like btc and eth will likely double and possibly triple in price by the end of the year as i mentioned earlier though a 2 or 3x on a small investment isn't a life-changing amount and you'll lose a lot of that money in exchange fees and transaction fees if you go with btc and eth luckily for you there are still dozens of cryptocurrencies that could 10x or more and a few of them might be on your list start by organizing the remaining cryptos on your list by market cap from largest to smallest as a general rule of thumb the smaller the market cap the more potential it will have to grow the trade-off here is risk smaller capitals will be very volatile and there's no guarantee that they'll pump next open up the coin market cap or coin gecko pages for each of those cryptos again and check to see what exchanges they're trading on if they're trading on good exchanges but not binance or coinbase then there's a possibility one of them could be listed there if they continue to see community growth and development now while i'm not sure about binance's listing criteria i recently made a video about coinbase's listing criteria which is linked to in the top right""]"

74,73,33,73_mutual_fund_mutual fund_funds,"['mutual', 'fund', 'mutual fund', 'funds', 'mutual funds', 'index', 'index fund', 'index funds', 'sp500', 'investment']","[""so it's similar to a mutual fund but instead of being run by some like fancy manager it's passively managed by a formula so instead of like a mutual fund where you're trying to beat the market you're basically trying to match the market so big difference is that you don't have that mutual fund manager so you're gonna cut out a whole lot of costs so index fund is something that you usually invest in you're gonna sit on for a while and not touch it one thing to keep in mind is all index funds are mutual funds but not all mutual funds are index funds it's kind of confusing i know basically the way this grows is through compounding interest which is basically reinvesting your interest into your initial loan or investment on mutual funds there's no interest paid but you might have dividends or capital gains reinvested to compound over time so looking at investor.gov here here's a compounding interest calculator to get an idea of how this would work let's say you put a thousand dollars in index fund let's say you put like a hundred dollars a month length of time let's say 30 years say we're gonna put out a hopeful eight percent and calculate annually look at this number you originally put in just 37 000 of your own cash and because of compounding interest it grows to 146 000 in 30 years so imagine if you were to put in a higher number of an initial investment more money each month or to do an account that has a bit of a higher annual rate of return [Music]"", ""so i was watching a video and someone explained it buying a stock is like buying one single flower but buying a fund is like buying the whole damn bouquet with all the bunch of different flowers so there's different kinds of funds and the ones i'm going to be talking about primarily today are index funds and mutual funds so mutual funds came along first and like i said earlier a fund is a big old bowl or bouquet of stocks and bonds and it's managed by an investor so some very smart guy or girl who understands the stock market is managing a fund or mutual fund and they using their brain and their knowledge of the market is selecting which stocks bonds etc they think are going to be the best investments to include in the bouquet so basically you're owning a bunch of stocks in one package so there's more diversification because if you're to invest in one stock let's say you buy a whole bunch of facebook and facebook just plummets all your money is gonna go down with facebook that's why it's very popular to hear that you need to diversify your portfolio basically don't put all your eggs in one basket mutual funds came along for that reason to be able to invest in stocks but to diversify across a larger like platform these are run like i said by some smart man or woman and they are gonna charge a big old fee maybe like one or two percent of your mutual funds so however much money you're putting in there you're paying them a little bit later along came index funds now i'm a big old fan of index fund so is warren buffett may i add one of the most successful investors in the world if you don't trust me trust warren buffett he knows what he's doing similarly an index fund is a portfolio of certain investments that you can buy into and then you own a little baby share of a whole bunch of different stocks and companies index is a representative sample of the stock market"", ""a mutual fund is sometimes called a pooled investment vehicle because it pulls money together from many investors it is generally managed by a professional investor called the portfolio manager the portfolio managers job is to select and monitor the individual investments for the fund's shareholders the price of a mutual fund is calculated by adding up the value of all the funds investments and dividing it by the number of shares outstanding this is called net asset value or nav let's look at a hypothetical example ABC investment company launches a mutual fund this specific mutual fund is only going to invest in environmentally friendly companies you read through their perspectives to determine if you want to invest in it a prospectus is a document that every mutual fund manager must make available to investors it describes the strategy these investment objectives and many other important details of the fund after reviewing the prospectus you determine you want to invest you decide you want to invest $1,000 worth of this fund the price of the mutual fund is updated each business day and will reflect the value of the funds investments so if the stocks that the fund owns rise in value the price of the fund will also rise in value [Music] for minimal investment investors get their investments managed by a professional investor diversification since mutual funds generally invest in many individual companies bonds or other securities the risk of owning a single investment is reduced when it comes time to buy or sell a mutual fund it is rather quick and easy for the individual investor this allows you to more closely manage your own investments next week we are going to look at setting up a portfolio we are going to walk through everything from having cash in your savings account to

you just have five dollars and buy the stock of whatever company you really like and that is possible assuming you choose the right broker and platform and that is why I would recommend Weeble because they offer what is known as fractional shares so as I just mentioned fractional shares is what we are after and what Weeble offers and as I just showed you with the example and as Weeble advertised by fractions of stocks at a five dollar minimum and then the cherry on top of this or well I should say the first Cherry pay zero dollars in commissions when you trade fractional shares with them and then the other cherry on top is assuming you just have five dollars or smaller amount is Weeble is always offering promotions where if you sign up then they're giving away free stock or free cash it always varies depending on you know the time of year but pointer being my argument would be you know what if you're only getting started with five dollars why not put some more cash quickly in your pocket by getting and taking advantage of a promotion that this broker is offering via the free cash or free stock so I will put a link Down Below in the description section and if you click on that then you'll be able to take advantage of whatever the promotion is full transparency sake that is an affiliate link"", ""so you don't have to buy shares in each you can instead buy shares in the fund which will give you automatic exposure to the big parts of the stock market of course all funds are not created equal which is why you have to focus on the fifth key principle of investing and that's pay less if someone buys a nice shirt for 50 bucks and you can buy the exact same shirt off a discount rack for 20 bucks why wouldn't you pocket the money right the same is true investing there are more expensive ways to do things and cheaper weights do the same thing let's talk about passive indexing what that means is investing in funds that track the market indices funds are try to mimic the S&P 500 or the Russell 2000 it's a low-cost way to get broad exposure to the market that's because index funds charge very low fees in fact Vanguard offers an S&P 500 index fund that is a point one four percent annual fee so investing three thousand dollars in it would only cost you $4 per year the average for comparable funds by the way those shirts on the expensive rack was over 1% that may not sound like a big difference but over a long period of time it can work out to some serious cash let's say you put three thousand dollars per year into the Vanguard fund and three thousand dollars per year into a comparable fund with an annual fee that is one percentage point higher so one point one four percent you knew this for 30 years during which time the stock market returns six percent in the hyphy fund you're doing pretty well you have over two hundred one thousand dollars after thirty years but in the Vanguard fund you're doing even better with over two hundred and forty four thousand dollars that's a forty three thousand dollar difference some serious cash and the reason fees and it's the fees you're paying Wall Street that figure right there is why we think individuals ought to take charge of their financial lives if you're still watching you're well on your way to doing just that so to recap I've talked about the five key principles that give you the mindset and the space to invest well these underlying principles will help you start out investing there's a lot more to learn before you're ready to buy individual stocks"", ""I'm going to go ahead and sell short the stock at 318 that means that you are now directing the broker to let you both borrow and then sell a share at that market price of 318 that means that every dollar goes under 318 you get to keep that extra dollar and if the stock drops down to oversold at 268 which it did here that means that now you only have to pay 268 to repurchase that chair and return it to the broker the broker doesn't care about how much you have to pay to repurchase the share they just want the share back and because you're able to get it back to them at such a discount you get to keep the extra profit and again if you didn't catch this earlier this process of repurchase in the share to give it back to the broker that's called covering your position you're covering the shares that you owe the broker and in this case covering your shares at 268 would have netted you a profit between the 318 that you sold these shares short at and and the 268 which you repurchase that which have knitted you a profit if you bought one share of that of $50 but on the other hand if you sold short at the same point and the share goes up to say $400 then you have to pay 400 to return that one share back to the broker since you borrowed insult to share short of 318 you now have to pay 72 more dollars to buy it back then when you had originally bought the share and that is basically short selling in a nutshell of course the topic of contention when it comes to comparing their regular purchase of stocks going long on a stock to shorting stocks is the different level of risk involved with each of them now I make a concerted effort in each of these videos to always touch on the risks involved with any of these strategies or any of the different ways that we go about trading the market""]"

not the greatest things for the market for it to start crashing consumers lose bit of confidence weak hands move away such as the guy on the train right now I see it as a couple possibilities we could be looking at $5,000 being a mental barrier that people set their cell walls at and we just about hit it and then came crashing down after that likely due to them or we could be see in a price correction that was overdue remember we did double in price in less than two months with around five percent growth a day now we're still up around sixty percent from this time last month so we can still afford to lose a lot more without really being any worse off however relax as the puppet is saying goes anything less than $100,000 Bitcoin in the long term is likely to be cheaper interestingly news out of the East from Russia is that they should have some sort of legal draft publication some form of legal status for Bitcoin they're aiming for the end of the month this comes amid a lot of turmoil about how to handle it some saying it should only be for accredited investors to use Bitcoin and others such as the internet advisor to the president stating that there should be more adoption and in fact unveiling a blockchain and cryptocurrency advocacy group earlier this week whether they get on the Bitcoin train or not probably isn't going to affect that train too much it'd be nice if they come out with some good news but even if it's bad then it's it's too late to stop and eventually they're going to need to change the law if it's really oppressive now a lot of you have been

expensive due to the very high market cap are you ever gonna load okay a hundred and eighty four billion in existence with a very high market cap of three hundred and seventy seven million dollars so even though it's at a fifth of penny you definitely say it's still expensive having a look at the website we can see that fee free instant payments are pretty cool"", ""we can see price has come down a lot from these highs we saw back at the last bull run the overall investor grade has been increasing slowly this yellow line right here and if we take a look fundamental grade at 79 valuation grade

have a market cap of 37.133 billion dollars a pe ratio of 24.87 and earnings per share of six dollars and 65 cents they have a five-year expected peg ratio of 1.09 and a price to book ratio of 4.45

1.22 billion dollars in total cash and the current ratio is 1.46 they're currently rated as a 2.4 meaning it's between a buy and a hold and the average analyst price target is 175.47 which is like six or seven percent higher than the current price of 165 dollars and 36 cents so inflation has been a widespread problem for retail businesses and dollar tree is no exception the company recently raised the value of its dollar items to one dollar and 25 cents a strategy the company called breaking the buck instead dollar tree claims to focus much harder on exceeding customer expectations by offering high quality products and services given these higher prices we should expect a slight decrease in profitability and sales for the business but what we get instead is a 6.5 percent increase in consolidated net sales and overall net growth in same store sales for the first fiscal quarter of 2022 reported at the end of may and recently dollar tree has been making changes to its executive leadership with the most recent change being bobby aflatoni the former executive vp and chief information officer of the howard hughes corporation joining the company as chief information officer to me this revision marks the company's sustained and unanimous efforts to grow and improve its business especially considering the fact that aflatuni's foreign positions greatly involved work in i.t dollar tree ceo mike matinski has explicitly said that these changes will bring fresh new perspectives that will help the company grow in the grand scheme of things dollar tree seems to be making a lot of the right moves i think we can all agree that a huge change in the market is happening soon with rising inflation rising interest and talks of a recession potentially happening in these circumstances dollar tree has conducted business that favors profits more than anything which i think is a huge advantage in the market that's about to be bearish so dollar tree plans to announce

chairman of research affiliates were best known for our work in smart data and asset allocation with about 180 billion in assets managed worldwide using our investment strategies we're a bit unusual we're singularly focused on research and product innovation and we work with distribution partners to make our ideas available to the marketplace so we deliver solutions in partnership with distribution powerhouses like PIMCO footsie SSG a Blackrock legal in general Invesco and Nomura to name just a few these firms bring our ideas to their end clients through mutual funds ETFs separately managed accounts and other vehicles so is one of the pioneers in smart beta in 2005 we introduced the research affiliates fundamental index also known as Rafi as an alternative to traditional market cap weighted indexes the fundamental index weights companies based on the size of the business not based on the popularity of the company not based on how much the market value is not based on how extravagantly expensive the company is so we weight companies based on measures like Book value cash flow dividends and sales thereby severing the link between the price and the weight of a stock in the index the Achilles heel of cap weighting is that it links the weight directly to the price so that the price doubles the made in the portfolio also doubles and that means that you are inherently overweight all the overvalued companies and underweight all of the undervalued companies even though you can't know which companies are which Rafi offers a contrarian approach that under weights overvalued stocks and favors out of favor more appropriately valued stocks as such it does have a distinct value tilt and it works remarkably well in most market environments in which value is winning which hasn't been the case in recent years but boy values gotten awfully inexpensive"", ""but if I go to the actual form for filing often there is a reason kind of behind some of the purchasing that you know these insiders tend to lay out for us in the case of Greg Abel that reason on the form 4 was listed as she is held of record by Gregory E Abel Trustee of Greg Abel revocable trust for the benefit of his wife children and other family members so this looks like just a straight up purchase for Greg Abel and his family which has gives him really nice alignment with other Berkshire shareholders but other times on these form fours it can lead you down kind of interesting rabbit holes a good example I stumbled across recently is in a theme park business called Six Flags entertainment they have been showing some huge Insider buyers on open Insider like in the tens of millions of dollars from our very Senior Management and if you look at the underlying form fours behind those purchases you see some very interesting things so with the Six Flags CEO for example the reason listed on the form for uh for making this purchase in the open market is a stock purchase obligation included in his employee agreement which is something I don't think I've seen before and these types of things can lead you down rabbit holes to do a little bit more digging on any kind of weird stuff that's going on with Senior Management compensation Arrangements in the case of Six Flags you actually can do some Googling and dig out these employment agreements for the likes of the CEO we're one of the elements of his employment agreement actually says During the period commencing at the beginning of the second trading day following the effective date and terminating 30 calendar days following the effective date the executive shall purchase an aggregate of 10 million dollars of common stock and open market transactions on the New York Stock Exchange and it's not just on the purchase side that these form four SEC filings can give useful context it's also quite helpful on the sale side from time to time as well take Charlie munger's investment in Costco for example he's been on the board of directors for Costco since the late 90s it's been a huge proponent of Costco as a great business for a very very long period of time and even today talks very positively about Costco almost at kind of every chance he gets so if you were just looking at something like open Insider for example it would have been very strange to see in 2010 that Charlie manga actually sold most of his shares in that business yet if you read the reason on the form four filing directly from Costco you'll see that most of those shares weren't necessarily sold because manga had a change in view on Costco's business or anything like that rather manga's wife had unfortunately passed away and a large chunk of the shares that were kind of held in munger's name for filing purposes were essentially distributed uh following Charlie munger's wife's death so liking that Peter Lynch quote right from the start of the video there's often many more reasons for selling than there are for buying and these SEC form 4 filings can be really really useful for trying to figure out exactly some of the reasons why these Insider transactions are taking place so there are some of my thoughts on and side of buying inside of selling and hopefully some tips and tricks that you find useful in your everyday investing buying stocks that insiders are buying isn't some sort of secret source to generating High returns although it does seem to be kind of a basket of stocks that does better than average from what I can tell in the research so it's an interesting place to hunt"", ""unwef Etc and you need to spread a bunch of global propaganda for your One World Vision to succeed that's not going to be possible if billions of people still aren't connected to the internet this makes mobile internet access and affordable data in least developed countries the most prioritized action of the sdgs but don't take it from me take it from gsma the global systems for mobile Communications Association which is the industry's largest Telco Forum they State mobile technology will be at the center of efforts to achieve the sdgs it's worth noting gsma is directly partnered with the UN and works with them on many sdgs initiatives it's also worth noting they're partnered with dent and this might give us our first clue into how debt was able to sign so many Partnerships so rapidly in so many countries because in total of the 109 mobile operators Dennis partnered with 91 are official members of gsma and since we know dense use case perfectly aligns with the sdgs and we know gsma is directly working on the sdgs with the UN it would definitely make sense that they'd be interested in a platform like dense remember to make the internet more affordable and accessible for all mostly means bringing it to those who don't have it yet and these people are likely living in one of 46 countries on the un's least developed countries list well through the Partnerships mentioned dentists already able to provide data top-ups to nearly 70 percent of those countries so you have gsma a direct un partner appearing to help integrate a future decentralized Marketplace for mobile data Dent into every least developed country in an effort to improve internet access which is coincidentally the most prioritized goal of the un's sdgs that gsma is actively working toward makes enough sense to me and since we're on the topic of things obviously being connected to the UN as part of dense Ico Dent actually pledged 1 billion tokens one percent of the total supply to the un's sdgs targeted at implementation of modern telecommunications infrastructure in developing countries pay attention to those words implementing infrastructure sounds a lot like the other co-founder of tarot katajanan's previous job is mobile systems Development Associate for a un office that literally describes itself as dedicated to implementing infrastructure for the United Nations system and look at the timing of it all tarot privately starts dent in 2014 starts working at the UN on implementing infrastructure projects for the UN system in January 2017 and then months later denco's public in July of that same year and speaking of implementing infrastructure that is exactly what sdg number nine and its sub targets are explicitly about to facilitate sustainable infrastructure development for developing countries and universal access to information and Communications technology clearly Dent was created for the sdgs remember and I'll say it again the un can't achieve the sdgs without affordable accessible internet for all because without it educating people around the world with Perpetual inescapable propaganda would be impossible this is where sdg number four comes in quality education sdg4 aims to provide children and young people with quality and easy access to propaganda I'm sorry education but notice what the UN says is the main cause for the current lack of quality Global education lack of Internet access they write lack of Internet access reduces paths to a world of information available online and limits the potential to learn and grow icts which are information and communication Technologies and the internet are critical enablers of the sdgs providing unprecedented social and economic benefits for millions of people around the world notably they support sdg4 and

and get another credit card preferably one with no annual fee and just go and do the exact same thing with that one over time you're going to develop a really great credit score that's going to give you the best and lowest rates on pretty much anything you'd ever want to finance which again just ends up saving you more money and if you're still confused with all of this by the way i'm going to link to a video that i did a while ago down below in the description that'll teach you exactly how to build your credit score in like under 20 minutes now another one of the mistakes that i see in those millennial money episodes is that very few of those people are taking advantage of their retirement accounts or investing and from the way i see it this is a huge missed opportunity with pretty much nothing but upside for example the best time to contribute to a roth ira is when you're young and when you're not in a high tax bracket that's because you're already in a low tax bracket and not losing a lot of money to taxes and you have more time for your money to grow into something much bigger and with the roth ira all the profit within that account becomes completely tax free after the age of 59 and a half or another one you could use a 401k which would help reduce your taxable income now and postpone it until retirement not to mention that a lot of employers will match your contribution dollar for dollar up to a certain amount that's pretty much just absolutely free money that so many people are just not claiming and by doing so they're leaving a lot of free money on the table just by not knowing about this so i highly recommend going for these retirement accounts always just always make it a priority to contribute up to the employer match max out the roth ira take advantage of everything at your disposal and do it consistently remember how i mentioned earlier in the video about paying yourself first well this is perfect pay yourself first into some of these retirement accounts likewise with this vanguard conducted a survey and found that one in five millennials owned no stocks whatsoever"", ""third all you got to do is put your normal expenses on the credit card just like you would spend any other day and fourth pay off your credit card in full at the end of every single month by the time it's due to avoid paying any interest frankly if you just paid attention to those four steps that covers about 80 percent of everything you need to know when it comes to building your credit and as long as you keep your balance completely paid off you'll get the lowest interest rates anytime you want to buy a house or leverage your money in fact most people don't realize that when it comes to buying a home having a good credit score could save you more than forty one thousand dollars just promise me that you'll be doing this if you haven't done it already it's so important and I'm sitting here on a Monday night at 9 00 PM just trying to get this point across to you and there are still people out there that'll watch these videos that don't do anything about it you know this is serious when I'm not asking you to subscribe or hit the like button or get a free stock Down Below in the description when you sign up for public.com because that could be worth all the way up to a thousand dollars trust me a good credit score goes a long long way and if you want to improve on the score you already have make sure to pay down your balances as much as possible add new credit cards into the mix and remove any negative marks in your credit report that could be bogging you down and fifth one of the biggest mistakes that almost everybody makes is not tracking your finances in fact this is so bad that 45 of Millennials have no idea how much money is in their bank account and only 24 of them are spending money in such a way that they could actually afford which is way less than I ever expected and that's got to stop first I'd immediately recommend signing up for a free budgeting software like mint.com which Aggregates all of your accounts and itemizes everything in one place second from there review all of your spending throughout the last 60 days even if you think you're perfect and you have nothing to cut back I guarantee that there are things in there that you have no idea ever existed and those are things that you could begin saving money on third speaking of saving money itemize everything into two categories the first one is your must-have non-negotiable spending and your second is the discretionary spending go ahead from all of those add them up fourth once you get that total begin cutting back in your discretionary spending that you don't absolutely need and then begin negotiating the mandatory spending to see if you could lower some of those costs trust me if you actually go and do this in a few hours you should be able to save a few hundred dollars a month without even realizing it plus if you're single it was found that the majority of women find irresponsible spending a turn off so get it together and finally six with 35 of millionaires saying that retirement is going to take a miracle don't forget to contribute to your retirement accounts as soon as possible that's because one of the biggest advantages that you have in your 20s is time not only can you write out any short-term fluctuations in the market but you could also take advantage of compound interest where the money you make makes you more money which makes you more money which makes you more money until eventually you're worth the quadrillion dollars and have a Lambo but just consider this if you invest a hundred dollars a month beginning at the age of 20 at an eight percent return by the time you're 65 you'll have five hundred and four thousand dollars invested but instead if you figured"", ""but even if you have all that money to just pay it in cash you should really never do that for reasons that i will get to in another video but as soon as you hit level 18 trust me get yourself a credit card because this side quest takes years to fully finish in order to build your credit history personally i recommend going with something like a secured credit card or this uh discover it's secured it's kind of like the gold standard if you don't have history and it's pretty cool because it gives you two percent cash back on different categories and one percent cash back on everything else but pro tip if you're a student in college instead of getting that one get yourself the cash back student edition of that card it's the same idea but it's going to give you better perks and the idea of this is to get a high score of 750 or higher and we could do all that within eight months to one year if you can follow these next few steps number one make sure to always pay your bills on time and never carry a balance because if you do you're going to pay more money in interest alone than all the rewards that you're going to get in return if you could do all that then 35 of your score will be accounted for just paying on time but if you miss your payment for whatever reason immediately pick up the phone and call the little number on the back of a credit card and ask them for forgiveness usually the first missed payment is going to be okay and it can be forgiven as long as you call and ask and number two is the utilization rate which accounts for a huge thirty percent of your score now if you can keep your utilization rate of thirty percent or lower you'll do just great for you have a thousand dollar monthly spending limit spend no more than three hundred thirty three dollars and thirty three cents but if you wanna be ultra conservative and do what i did and get there far quicker then utilize no more than ten percent or a hundred dollars or less in this case now you could literally just buy one little tiny thing like a pack of gum or just some gas and in that case your utilization rate will be in the single digits and that will improve your score dramatically and number three is your length of history which accounts for 15 of your credit score which is why it's so important to do this as early as possible now for me this is what drags my score down the most and if i had started when i was 18 my score would easily be over 800 by now but pro tip cheat code if you can have your parents co-sign on their credit cards for you then you will inherit their credit score if they have an excellent score i couldn't do this because my parents didn't have a good score but your mileage may vary if you can do these three things you will easily and quickly beat this side quest the third item on this list is something you need to get asap as soon as you hit level 18 it's probably the most important part of this video and that is a retirement account it could be traditional or a roth ira now think of these accounts like savings accounts except instead of putting your cash in here what you're putting in here is mostly stocks and the reason you want to do this is because it protects your money from taxes in the case of a traditional ira you pay no taxes today but you will pay taxes later on the money that it's grown into in the case of a roth ira you pay taxes up front but no taxes later in life when you withdraw those millions that you're ready to retire on if you have no idea which one you want to pick you can actually have both a traditional and a roth but remember you can only contribute six thousand dollars per year and you can contribute it down the middle however you want fifty fifty one year in one one year in the other doesn't really matter now if you could do this early look how much coin you can end up with assuming a growth rate of eight percent which is what you can expect from the stock market now assuming you started to max out your roth ira account at level 18 for three years only three years until level 21 when you're fully evolved into an adult you will have ended up with 781 thousand dollars which is an insane amount of money at retirement that's amazing if you had done this at 31 then you would have ended up with 287 000 at age 67 which is almost two and a half times less all because you started just 13 years later which isn't that much of a difference that's the power of time and compound interest at work so pause this video if you're 18 years or older and go and make that account because you're literally losing money right now""]"

the danger of the National Default growing Democrats are hoping an unlikely savior will come to the rescue Mitch McConnell of Kentucky Democratic lawmaker Sam McConnell and other Republicans are fooling themselves if they think McCarthy is in a position to reach a debt deal with Biden they believe McCarthy is under tremendous pressure to not agree to any Deal Democrats would accept because the house rules allow for one disappointed conservative to offer a motion to vacate the speaker's chair basically to fire him now Senate Republicans are putting their heads in the sand if they think that extremists in their party will have a change of heart if McCarthy is forced to choose between holding power or taking us closer to default we know he's going to move us closer to default yikes uh so now they're trying to get McConnell to negotiate a deal with the quote reasonable Republicans oh dear McConnell I would have never been con I mean this is wild they're now calling McConnell a reasonable Republican maybe he is maybe he's changed I just think anybody who remembers the kova days so frustrated by Pelosi and"", ""i mean to get his nomination up we can finally look at something like the wall street journal's editorial board and say wait a minute these are two real risks that maybe we haven't considered before so take a look at these risks first uh as a preface before we talk about the two risks it's worth noting that uh the wall street journal's editorial board agrees that brainard will probably be very much like a conjoined twin to powell and act very much the same as powell that is keep rates low keep uh keep uh essentially uh the taper moving at a relatively slow pace and be patient with the market wait to see what happens with inflation before acting too fast or potentially too quickly to tighten but the wall street journal editorial board gives us two potential risks the first of the two is right here take a look at this the wall street journal editorial board basically goes as far as calling bernard a flip-flopper look at this donald luskin of trend macro notes brainard struck a dovish tone in september of 2016 before the election but on the eve of the trump presidency's inauguration in january of 2017 she suddenly discovered that the fed was close to its inflation and unemployment targets and two months later called for tighter monetary policy so here the wall street journal editorial board is giving us a a warning you're giving us a heads up that hey wait a minute wait a minute wait a second if we get powell we might have somebody who stays consistent who stays the course and stays with that inflation's transitory argument through the middle of next year if we get brainerd while we think that she's going to be on the same course that might be the oversimplification she could end up flip-flopping just like she has in 2016-17 where she previously flip-flopped literally on the same discussion inflation versus tighter monetary policy this is a warning this is a risk to the markets that hey if we get brain art we have a higher likelihood of a sudden flip flop than we would with powell but the second concern that the wall street journal editorial board brings up really comes after they just utterly crush drone powell listen to this neither one deserves the job powell or brainard if you judge them based on how well they have performed in their main duty of maintaining price stability the powell fed has presided over inflation that it failed to predict and has been slow to address the fed's professed inflation target is two percent but consumer price index that consumer price index rose 6.2 on october above a year earlier by any measure this is a historic failure mr powell's credibility has been damaged with his persistent refrain until recently that inflation is transitory his new monetary policy framework of average inflation targeting this is by the way formerly known as fate flexible average inflation targeting unveiled in august 2020 has been a bust now obviously the fed would say hey well wait a minute we designed fate for a three or four year time frame it's going to take time to see flexible average inflation targeting you can't just average over a few months you gotta have average over a few years so obviously powell and brainard would probably defend the fed uh dramatically here"", ""Biden and McCarthy they reached a handshake deal on the debt ceiling both parties are claiming success while many in both parties are saying they got nothing out of it carthy came out to tell the American people that this was transformational while Jeffries said it was an incredibly significant step towards protecting Social Security here's the bottom line the government's in gridlock Republicans control the house Democrats control the Senate so they have to compromise Wall Street thinks this is a good thing because they do not want any one party to Rule the Day president has to sell it to the Democrats and McCarthy has to sell to the Republicans to get a place of agreement there's a ton of reasons why members in both parties would not sign and would not agree because largely in my view after looking at the agreement there was really very minor concessions made on all sides no somebody was getting a lot out of the deal it kind of was business as usual in Washington but here's the timeline that we're gonna watch it gets kicked off on Wednesday the house is going to vote and then it's gonna go if it passes there to the Senate and those guys will have four days to get it passed if they sign it in that four day period it's then going to get rushed over to the president who's going to sign it into law if everything went perfectly that would give us the date of June 5th which would be next Monday for a resolution to the debt ceiling crisis we already know though that Janet Yellen has been out sounding the alarms that the U.S government will absolutely run out of cash early June and if we were to default she has said many times that it would cause severe damage to financial institutions as well as the general economy and on that note a recent analytics report said that a brief debt ceiling breach would slash 1.5 million jobs wow raising unemployment from 3 point four percent to five percent my first thought on that is well that would make the FED happy his goal is to get unemployment up to begin to put pressure on inflation and that would immediately solve that concern so you really never know what the powers that be may do in this situation and we also got a report from Goldman Sachs they predicted that the treasury will run low on cash by June 8th or 9th unless the debt ceiling limit was raised this basically means that the government is just barely screeching across the finish line to get this whole thing resolved now I have to play this clip by Warren Buffett on balancing the U.S budget because in my view it is timeless classic war and wisdom and it's spot on so check this out these problems aren't been mature enough for a president that's been mature enough to take this head off""]"

likely to break bullish out of this descending wedge when it does so after bottoming out either where it's bottomed right now or slightly above 25 000 you're going to want to look for some confirmations first and foremost you can look for a confirmation of a breakout based on breaking above this downtrend second and second most you could wait for a confirmation of Lux algo giving you a Buy Signal with Trend catcher confirmation that would be another confirmation thirdly you could wait for Bitcoin to break above the 100 and above the 50 daily moving average that would give you another confirmation all of those confirmations would likely come into play sometime in the beginning of June maybe into mid-june around 26 to 27 000 after you breach through that zone and maybe after you break above let's say twenty seven thousand five hundred dollars that's where you might say okay if there's enough exuberance here I am confident to go ahead and and start preparing to enter a trade remember the hurricane is likely to hit Jacksonville the metaphorical Jacksonville is the long train it's less likely to hit Panama City than metaphorical short traits we're not going to spend as much time on the short trade we're gonna spend the majority of our time on a long trade because that's what's more likely to be necessary if Bitcoin breaks here above this downtrend we have Lux algo coming in green we have uh this level of 27 500 broken maybe we even see a Fed rate pause coming in as icing on the cake in June 14th meeting then that's where you may enter a long position as Bitcoin starts to come back to the upside around let's say 27 750."", ""it's a falling wedge and they break out around 70 of them happened perfectly as I predicted 70 of the move we broke out and you can see Bitcoin is now sitting right above that triangle it already broke out and it formed a w formation if we can get a confirmation here a retest and a bounce Bitcoin will be going to 25 000 first

gigantic market crash it was uh obviously terrible price dropped 40 percent in a day 55 uh overall from the all-time high bitcoin down to the bottom and you know a lot of people really freaked out because they're watching their wealth get drained and i was certainly looking at my portfolio of unrealized gains and just saying to myself like you know i wish i would have been a little bit even stronger taking profits but the truth is i've done a good job taking profits all along the way and a lot of my audience unfortunately hasn't i'm sure a lot of your audience uh you know has it as well and the reason is is because there's something about when you get into crypto and it's new it's just so euphoric and you start heading down the rabbit trail and you start seeing what the technology is and you're like man this is so exciting you just really deeply believe in it and when that happens you just live in this fantasy that it's going to go up forever and then you get your world violently shook like we had a few weeks ago and it really just brings everything back to reality so what i want to do is talk about three taking profit strategies that i've used uh that i think anybody can use to not only make money but keep your money so the first one is going to be very simple right dollar cost average what is dollar cost averaging this means you take usually when people are saying it they're talking about it in investing so you put money into the markets spread across a certain period of time so let's say you wanted to invest in ethereum you you want to put a thousand dollars per month into ethereum it doesn't matter where the price is it doesn't matter if it goes up it goes down every month on let's say the 15th of the month you put one thousand dollars in and over time what that does is that removes the volatility really what you're investing in is you're investing in the yearly average price uh when you do that over one year's time over 12 months"", ""and it's really really helpful to make sure that you stay on top of your budget so you're not spending 400 at the store accidentally and running out of money now you also want to consider buying store brand or generic brand over the brand names that we're used to so instead of buying some frosted flakes maybe consider buying those flake frosts or whatever they call them at the store the knockoff brands because honestly most of them and there's actually been tests you can look at consumer reports they run a lot of different tests on this in a lot of cases this food is nearly the same of brand name items like chef boyardee versus like some other type of like weird noodles it in most cases it's fairly the same there's a couple differences like pop-tarts for example the real pop-tarts are better than the store brand by the way um or oreos but for the most part uh they're fairly similar and on average you can save over 15 percent by buying store brand over the brand names which fifteen percent on say you spend seven thousand dollars per year on food that's almost a thousand dollars per year that you can save by buying the store brand versus the name brand items for food"", ""and sometimes it may indeed indicate that the previous owner took great care of his price possession and surely you should pay whatever you think something is worth in some cases I too would pay a couple thousands extra I like the colored accessories coming with the beach Daytona said the quirky two-door peanut box or the Omega crater box for example some cool provenance of the previous owners appreciated too but especially with vintage Rolex the premiums are Justified for all the wrong reasons and simply too high do as you please but let this serve as a caution and remember you can't wear a box and or papers over to our next subject Investments and regardless of what you've read or heard generally speaking wristwatches are a terrible performing asset compared to the Dow Jones Metals real estate Etc bear in mind the majority of timepieces plummeted value officer purchase think about that Armani Versace Tommy Hilfiger stuff and not only the cheap watches show tremendous downside on the resale side how about the blow Panerai some highly complicated pieces from Brands like at ABC or the Lion's Share of betual executions with that being said the luxury watch Market in particularly established Brands and more recently Independence potentially have an interesting Roi yet it's easy to discard pieces as a bad investment but nobody can answer you what's the best investment any dealer claiming this and selling your watch as such is full of  and should be avoided at all times even if one would be able to answer that question why would he be selling it then now the interesting question arises

(water splashing) (suspenseful music) The second thing you should never do with your money is have too much of it sitting in cash."", ""so let's imagine that you are saving for retirement and you're going to invest $1,000 every month in the ABC fund currently ABC is trading at $50 per share since you're investing $1,000 this month you're going to buy 20 shares which is $1,000 divided by $50 per share for now we are ignoring any Commission's which we will come back to in a minute right now your cost per share is $50 simple enough well next month ABC falls to $40 per share you invest the same $1000 this month that you did last month but this time you get 25 shares because the price is lower $1,000 divided by 40 at this point you own 45 shares and you have invested a total amount of $2,000 making your cost per share forty-four dollars and forty four cents which you get by dividing $2,000 the total amount invested by the 45 shares you own the following month ABC goes back to $50 per share so you get another 20 shares for the new $1000 now you have invested $3,000 and you own 65 shares your cost per share averages out to be 46 dollars and 15 cents so the theory with dollar cost averaging is that the higher the price of the fund goes the less shares you buy the lower it goes the more shares you buy assuming that you have an investment that you have done a good amount of research on and you are confident that over time it will rise in value dollar cost averaging gives you the advantage of making the volatility of the fund work in your favor this brings us to the potential downside in our scenario you invest $1,000 every month but what if you wanted instead to invest 250 dollars every week same amount as before but you're going to do it more often this is where the Commission's I mentioned before can hurt you so every time you place a trade you generally have to pay Commission if that Commission is $10 per trade if you only trade it once a month it will cost you $10 but if you did it weekly it will cost you $40 depending on the amount investing that $40 may or may not change your mind as to the frequency that you invest if you're investing just $50 per week which is $200 a month well that $40 cost is going to hurt a lot since it's a large percentage of the amount invested but if you're investing $1,000 per week that $40 doesn't hurt as much on a $4,000 monthly investment so in summary to make dollar cost averaging work for you have investments that you're confident in choose a consistent amount and a consistent time interval keep an eye on your commission costs and make sure that they don't get out of control relative to the amount you invested then stick with the program for the long run"", ""i mean we talked about green investments and green finances is a big big hit over the next couple of years like larry fink from blackrock investments told us but have a look if you have missed it climate change is going to require a huge energy transition it's going to be 40 or 50 years so we're not running away we need to have an organized plan for those kind of trees other countries too that are heavily based on hydrocarbons for those countries for those states for those municipalities our job is to inform them what we are seeing as an asset allocation we are not running away from all hydrocarbons because we do believe they play a role we believe natural gas plays a very large role in the in the energy transition and so we believe this is a process not just we're not we're not stopping we are we did make a statement that coal is not a good investment now but the most important thing is through that transparency our job is to provide better risk analytics better risk adjusted returns with a sustainability so according to the article where you find the link into the description you will see that the us legal green leaf market could potentially double to about 41.5 billion dollars by 2025 this is a huge market guy so considering that a company can achieve you know part of the market it can be quite lucrative for the company itself so then obviously we have the green leaf appears to be a more widely unaccepted for multitude of apparent health benefits this means that you know you see more in consumable health products like maybe creams you see that used into you know uh to for smoking devices you see that for even toothpaste is having green leaf inside them just because the health benefit is really really great and if you think about it you know the health benefit it's it's not something new that the people are discovering now it is used for hundreds and hundreds of years in different kind of cultivates and cultures where we just come a little bit late to the game and the nice thing about the county line energy corp is that they're currently trying to expand as well""]"

guys to compare yourself to others because this is your own journey don't give up because others are retiring earlier than you rather use that as inspiration for wanting to retire early yourself the stats show that 36 percent of workers and retirees have under 1 000 in their savings and stats also show that about half of people retire earlier than they had planned to and this is usually because there's something that forces them to stop working early that stat should sort of scare you and give you some much-needed stress that you need to build up your savings faster than you'd think otherwise you might not have enough money at the end of the day when you are forced to retire so the first step in retiring early is you want to live like you have ten dollars in your bank account aka you want to be frugal as more specifically i want you guys to save at least 50 of your income as you're making more and more money this can be higher so we're talking like 70 80 even 90 or more now of course saving money is extremely challenging and that's why most people don't save a lot of money some quick tips i have for you guys is maybe get a roommate or a partner to live with this is greatly going to reduce your housing bill also limit the number of restaurants you go to especially the more expensive ones and really avoid going out to bars or clubs and when it comes to cars try and get yourself a cheap used car that is really reliable what you want to do is you want to train yourself to live frugally because this is really going to make how much you need to save a lot less the more frugal you are the smaller that fire bucket is going to have to be now how i like to think of it is for every one thousand dollars per month you spend you're gonna need around three hundred thousand dollars for that fire bucket one thousand dollars per month equates to twelve thousand dollars of spending per year and if you multiply that by the magic number 25 that gets you 300 000 another cool way to look at it is for every 8.3 cents you use per month which equates to one dollar per year you're gonna need to save 25 that sort of puts it into perspective how much more money you need to save for each dollar you spend per month or per year"", ""this is a retirement account that you could invest pre-tax money into and then you're taxed later on the money after the age of 59 and a half and third you could look into investing within an HSA which stands for a health savings account essentially this is used for medical expenses and both contributions profits and withdrawals are completely tax-free now there are some qualifications for this and a quick Google search will tell you whether or not you're eligible but if you are you could invest another three thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars a year this means just between those three options you could potentially invest and shelter up to thirty two thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars a year in income without doing anything fancy number six not having more than one source of income this one is actually so important that the IRS issued a report on high income tax returns and what they call the distribution of economic well-being which basically means they want to figure out why certain people make so much money and what they found is that the more income sources you have the more money you tend to make in fact when it comes to this 65 percent of millionaires have at least three sources of income so you are doing yourself a disservice if you're not actively working on something on the site to bring in

Mr Money Mustache has the perfect chart that shows you exactly how much you'll have to save in order to retire for example someone who saves 10 of their income would be able to retire after 51 years will someone saving forty percent could retire into 22 years by viewing everything from this perspective it'll give you a much greater understanding in terms of exactly how much you'll need to save and for how long now by the time you're in your 40s things really begin to speed up the median net worth between 40 and 49 is 164 000 the average is 761 000 and if you want to be in the top one percent that'll be about ten and a half million dollars interestingly enough though one of the biggest drivers of net worth in your 40s isn't necessarily your savings your income or your expenses but instead your home that means that at this age buying a home is one of the largest factors that positively affects your net worth likely because a mortgage forces you to automatically build equity every month and in general homes tend to go up in value of course you could also argue that those who have a higher income and more financial literacy are more likely to buy a home to begin with which skews the data but either way at this age number one you should consider buying a home now this one's certainly not required but buying a home is going to give you a lot more stability in the sense that you're not going to have to worry about your living situation in retirement what's paid off you're not going to be at the whims of a landlord and values over time have generally gone up in value depending on where you're buying the second if possible you should also max out your retirement accounts interestingly enough your 40s also coincide with what's called your Peak earning years meaning you've built up enough experience and momentum to command a significantly higher salary so ideally if you're interested in retiring before the age of 65 you should be working to max out your Roth IRA and your 401k to make sure you're on track and finally third if possible aim to have between five and seven years of your expenses saved up that's because for a 30-year retirement you're going to have to have between 25 and 33 times your annual spending invested in order for that money not to run out and in your 40s this is the number you should really be focusing on not necessarily your net worth but then from there we have your 50s with a median net worth of 171 thousand dollars an average net worth of one million one hundred and sixty five thousand dollars and a top one percent Network worth of 17 million five hundred and forty five thousand dollars by this age most experts recommend that you have anywhere between five to seven times your annual salary saved up and invested in order to be on track to retire which means the median person is very much behind and has a lot of catching up to do just consider this it was found that the average person spends fifty thousand dollars a year in retirement which works out to be forty one hundred and twenty eight dollars a month so with an average Social Security payment coming in at twenty four hundred and eighty four dollars a month that means you'll need to bring in a monthly income of sixteen hundred and forty four dollars to bridge the difference assuming no major health complications no social security issues and no unexpected life events that means following the four percent rule which suggests that you could spend four percent of your portfolio every single year without running out you would need five hundred thousand dollars invested not including the value of your house car or anything else that isn't producing an income that's why first you should absolutely track your expenses this will give you a a better understanding in terms of how much you'll need in retirement and will give you a blueprint to how much you'll need to save to get there this might also include moving to a cheaper location cutting back in your expenses or doing anything else that you can to plan for a time that you may no longer be working and second depending on your situation you should be about halfway through or very close to paying off your mortgage hopefully when that happens it'll reduce your expenses dramatically and give you a lot of peace of mind that no matter what happens you have a home that's completely paid off now remember that doesn't mean that you can't work or make money at all in retirement but it is about giving you the option of not working whether that be voluntary or out of necessity and finally we have the net worth in your 60s which is where the numbers begin to Peak as you could see the median net worth is 271 thousand dollars the average is 1.25 million dollars and if you want to be in the top one percent it's a net worth of 16.4 million surprisingly everything from this point on is kind of downhill for example every age bracket afterwards from median average and top 1 percent declines likely as they begin working less and spending down their money however a few things in this age bracket will begin to happen""]"

keep looking here the good news there is good news the company does have money they have corporate cash I like that I like corporate cash sitting around 2.5 million a billion dollars sorry and 2.8 over here in Money Market okay great that's nice but how much of this my friends are they actually burning well when we go to the cash flow statement and we jump over here and look at net cash used by operating activities in the last nine months they've burned nearly five billion dollars but wait a minute wait a minute how much cash did they have oh right they had roughly five billion dollars in cash which is roughly the equivalent of how much they literally burned wasting money over the last five months but it's okay it gets better their their revenues okay their revenues for the three months ended September 2022 compared to 21. fell by 53 percent while at the same time their technology costs went up by 56 percent so understand that for a moment okay Revenue down 53 percent expenses for running coinbase.com up 56 percent it's not good"", ""it's an actual legitimate official thing but this one is from a business point of view now before I share with you that income please understand I realize it is still a lot of money by any stretch of the imagination it is not normal it is not relatable and I'm not complaining it's extremely privileged but I still want to show it to you because I think it gives us an insight into how companies are feeling about the recession and the overall budget restrictions which I think affect everyone so just for context in 2021 my ad Revenue was averaging roughly one hundred thousand dollars per month that was in 2021 and even back then I realized that was just not a normal time and it makes sense everyone was indoors everyone was watching YouTube videos about how to make more money how to invest more money we had close to zero percent interest and people were making insane amounts of money off the most random event Investments so that was the year not only for crazy investing but also for investment channels slash entertainment channels like my own here on YouTube but then in 2022 as the World opened up and as interest rates started to climb higher to fight inflation the economy started to slow down so in the start of 2022 my ad Revenue was cut by roughly 50 percent now on a relative basis that is pretty substantial and that's when I started to see the writing on the wall and I was like I could see where this is going now in 2023 this year my YouTube ad revenue is a fraction of what it was last year I am now down to roughly 20K a month which is about where I was in 2019 back when I started my YouTube channel now don't get me wrong that is still a lot of money but on a relative basis that is a huge cutback from where it was before by the way this is not just true for my YouTube channel this is true for all Finance channels across the board as far as I'm aware of now companies are doing exactly what any normal person should do in a recession the cutting back spending and they're increasing their savings how do they cut back spending they stop spending on their number one expense which is their labor costs so they let people go and how do they increase their savings they stop spending money on Advertising as soon as I saw the writing on the wall in 2022 I was like yep 2022 is going to be bad and sure enough it was downhill then 2023 was even worse but I also had a sneaking suspicion that inflation would stay high and that interest rates would have to go up to fight it that was pretty obvious at that point so I took the largest amount of money that I could to borrow that I knew I could service I got a loan on it at the cheapest rate possible right before interest rates started to Skyrocket and I bought that house which was extremely expensive but it was enough to rent it out to someone to at least break even and make a little bit of profit on it and that house Believe It or Not would have to be worth at this point at these interest rates 40 percent less for my monthly payment to be the same so think about that I would have to wait for that house to fall almost half of its value almost for that payment to be the same as it was when I bought it now I do think real estate will at some point correct but I don't think it's going to crash 40 percent that would be catastrophic and we're not there"", ""so let's take a simple business like a smoothie company their cost of revenue is fruit they can't make the smoothies without buying that therefore that is a cost they have no choice about it's a simple fact of running their business but the next thing they do have a choice about which is their operating expenses who they're hiring and what kind of wages that they're paying them after these expenses are deducted from the total amount of money they take from their customers you get the operating income so here's my simple calculation that lets me know if the business is healthy operating income divided by total revenue times 100 ideally i look for above 15 using apple again let's take this number divided by this number and we get 27 which is great the last one of the big three is the statement of cash flow i'm not going to spend too much time on this one as when you boil it down it's pretty simple the main thing i look out for is if the company i'm investing in has increase in free cash flow year on year which is money they can use to reinvest or pay back to investors a big red flag here is sometimes i see the cash flow is negative but the company is still paying dividends back to its investors it's just unsustainable and eventually the business is just going to run out of cash now once i've had a good look at all these numbers it's time to get into the juicy stuff""]"

it's the only way to invest directly within the commodity itself for my knowledge you've got a wide band of companies that will improve over time if you rhenium prices go up most likely so you know

you are a is able to be traded on Robin Hood and pretty much any brokerage platform that I've used some of these down here some of these smaller cap miners might not be available on something like Robin Hood and you have to find a brokerage platform that will give you that flexibility a few other things that I thought I'd point out as well in regards to your any markets one company that I didn't list is quezada prom and when we're talking about large uranium miners we're down about the largest here and regrets during in mining because that a prom is looking do their IPO in London and they're doing GDRs so it's called global depository receipts and basically with these receipts it's a way that you can trade foreign companies I don't know I kind of am reading it here in this smart small post that just came out today actually from Reuters here that they're doing GDRs I don't know if it's going to be available in the US it looks like they're saying it's gonna be available in the country that because not a promise based Kazakhstan but hopefully it'll be available in Western markets usually tends to be that or that they work out something later down the road so you can get exposure to one of the largest uranium miners in the world hopefully so these are really are different options here guys again"", ""wow if things potentially change fast here right robin hood's dual class shares currently give its founders control of 64 of the voting shares outstanding so basically what that means is if a deal was presented in the robin hood founders wanted to take that deal or not take that deal they could easily outvote everybody else essentially because of the way the the voting class is set up so that is just something to keep in mind that let's say ftx hypothetically offered 10 billion dollars for robin hood if the robin hood founders did not want to essentially take that they would just vote against it and doesn't matter the rest of the shareholders could you know vote for it and still wouldn't matter now do keep in mind if you're wondering that must just be only robinhood that's some freak situation no actually a ton of the big tech companies nowadays are set up like that not the old school ones that have been around for 20 30 years but a lot of the new school ones that have went public in this decade a lot of them that are set up basically for their founders to have almost all voting control on these companies essentially so that is something to keep in mind now the reason this is so intriguing is robin hood as of their latest quarter had well

with a name that you recognize or that you know sometimes you'll see these online brokers they're advertising trade for $2 or $3 and that might be enticing but if you don't know the company you know how good the execution is gonna be on those trades another thing you just don't know if that company is insured by the SI pc so make sure it's a thing that you recognize it could be Scottrade e Trade TD Ameritrade there are many different choices the second thing you want to figure out is what are you actually going to be buying online is it stocks ETFs mutual funds all the different online brokers have their little niches that they focus on for example if you're looking for stocks purely stocks each ray t v-- ameritrade ur probably be a little bit cheaper than a Scottrade with mutual funds Scottrade has over 30 100 different mutual funds that you can buy with no transaction cost if you're looking to buy stocks but want to focus on dividend reinvestment capital one share builder is another great resource to go to and the last thing you want to focus on is fees mostly the online brokers are really cheap in their fees but make sure there's nothing on the back end they're going to try to ding you on for example do they have an annual account fee or an annual maintenance fee are they going to charge you if you transfer your account out do they charge for advice if you have a question you want to call their toll-free number is there additional cost hopefully this isn't an add-on just an additional service that they provide so if you have a question you're not going to get charged for it if you're not sure what the best online stock broker is for you be sure to head over to the site we have a comparison review table that shows all the different online brokers that you

whether we are trading correctly or trading not correctly are we making money or not making money the roi is measurable the second thing we can measure is our probabilities which would sound like probabilities spelled it weird whatever which would be how often are we winning versus when we're losing what is that winning percentage we're winning at 50 60 what's our risk to reward ratio the third thing that we can measure is our risk management and although all three of these things are wildly important these measurable aspects of our trading are not all we need and the one thing that every trader that wants to become wealthy must have does not fall under these categories although yes you will have to have each of them the one thing we're going to talk about in today's video though

improve and we can't even examine our emotional toughness our mental and emotional toughness so what you have to do here is figure out how much pain can you actually tolerate before you become emotional before you start to overreact or make bad decisions based on emotions instead of logic and the way we do this is just by asking ourselves simple questions the way i like to do this especially in terms of the aspect of trading is what would you be willing to risk what would you be willing to lose how much pain could you withstand going through on your account before you started to act emotional let's just do an example here and say you have a ten thousand dollar account would you be willing to risk two hundred dollars of that account every time you place a trade would you only be willing to risk 100 and then start getting emotional what is your opinion right now on this exact scenario and if you don't have a ten thousand dollar account or one thousand dollar account a one hundred dollar account it does not matter what the starting balance is ask yourself what amount of money you'd be comfortable losing and then you have to test that theory and see how comfortable you are actually losing that money and i'm not saying go out and try this i'm not saying go out and lose 200 to see if you're okay with losing two hundred dollars but you have to somehow see what your tolerance is once you find that pain tolerance in order to increase your mental and emotional toughness it is your job to stay within that pain tolerance so let's say your pain tolerance allows for losses up to 100 per trade based on your specific financial situation if you're willing to risk 100 per trade then that means that is your pain tolerance and that's where you need to stay the way you do that is with risk management risk management is going to allow you to stay within that pain tolerance which is going to in turn increase your mental and emotional toughness number two is preparation i want you to think about giving a very important speech to a huge crowd of people just in general you have to have a lot of emotional and mental focus and toughness in order to do something like that right now i want you to imagine doing it with absolutely no preparation you just get up on stage and start talking about whatever subject they give you that sounds terrifying to me and i imagine it sounds terrifying to you as well and it should be because another way to improve your mental and emotional toughness is to prepare now i want you to think about that same exact situation except now you've taken time to prepare for this moment over the past four weeks you have a speech memorized completely you have bullet points down in case you get lost at any point and you're completely prepared for this speech how much less nervous are you going to be right so the way we attack preparation is to wait for it prepare and the way we prepare comes down to back testing same as with that speech you go into the markets no preparation whatsoever you're just clicking buy and sell randomly because you want to make money and the only way to make money is to be in trades so you get in a lot of trades you start to lose you're not using good risk management so instead of just losing a hundred dollars you lose a thousand dollars this is the cycle of doom that happens to so many new and struggling traders and that's something i want to help you avoid with this video so preparation is a key part in creating mental and emotional toughness in our trading i want you to think about being in a ufc fight not physically like a metaphorical ufc fight so you're in that fight and you don't have your hands up your hands are down the whole time you have no defense you're not using head movement whatsoever how many times are you gonna get punched and how many of those punches is it going to take for you to just get knocked out depends on who you're fighting but i would imagine not very many you're probably getting knocked out very soon using risk management and having this mental and emotional toughness using back testing preparing for these types of situations is our defense that is us with our hands up using head movement parries we are using those things whenever we're in this metaphorical ufc fight if we have a mental and emotional toughness by correctly using risk management and preparing through the process of back testing that's your defense that's your hands up when the market's coming at you and that's something that is absolutely necessary and finally number three is do not over react overreacting is something that gets traders into trouble all the time but the reason they overreact ironically is because the first two steps have not been taken ninety percent of time if someone overreacts it's because they don't have a good risk management plan so they're moving their stop loss up or taking the trade off when they're in a little bit of a loss or taking their trade off when they're just a little bit in profit instead of following their trading plan they're overreacting by switching strategies when they've only lost two or three trades using one strategy they're overreacting because they have not prepared by doing back testing and having that risk management plan to follow so simply put the way you keep from overreacting is by following the other rules i'm going to put follow other steps fos you follow the other steps and that keeps you from overreacting and with these three things i promise you you will greatly improve your mental and emotional toughness which is one thing that every trader that is wealthy has and that if you ever plan to be a wealthy trader someone who's able to quit their job by trading in the forex market stock market whatever financial market you're in someone that eventually grows massive wealth from trading in financial markets without mental and emotional toughness that will be impossible but if you do master this you take the three steps i've shown you in this video then you have a greater chance a much greater chance you're almost inevitably going to have increased and

our research insights interactive tools and more drop by at researchaffiliates.com and raffi.com i will read a piece titled a quick survey of quote-unquote broken asset classes introduction pundits prognosticators and even investment boards often make misleading declarations that an asset class is broken that its prospects for earning investors a reasonable future return are very dim these proclamations can lead to investors abandoning these assets to chase recent winners advisors are uniquely positioned to educate their clients about historical asset class returns and to provide context for recent perhaps disappointing performance in this way advisors can prepare their clients for substantial variations in an assets returns a prepared client is a confident one and confidence begets the tenacity to hold assets over the long term raising the likelihood of a successful investment experience via diversification rebalancing and long-term compounding and isn't that what financial advice is all about warnings of the long-term impaired viability of asset classes have spooked investors through history one of the most notorious was businessweek's cover story the death of equities published in 1979 u.s stocks are not alone however other quote-unquote broken asset classes abound by the late 1990s reits were dismissed as losing the power to diversify a portfolio and a 1999 article in the economists concluded cheap oil is likely to remain so fast forward 20 years to the present headlines team with sentiments such as does investing in emerging markets still make sense and is value investing dead it might be and here's what killed it so history is littered with examples of reputable pundits media outlets and prognosticators cautioning investors about broken asset classes typically at the heels of sagging absolute returns or poor results relative to mainstream markets similar warnings also occurred during investment board meetings in his consulting days john recalls back in february 2000 a board meeting of an 800 million pension fund recent market movements namely growth stock outperformance had pushed the fund's asset allocation out of compliance with its investment policy statement requiring a larger balance out of growth stocks into core bonds and small cap value the resistance to the mandated rebalance was unsurprisingly for those who may have lived through this period stiff with one board member stating that small cap value is a dead asset class indeed it appeared the board preferred to eliminate small cap value rather than top it up fortunately the investment policy statement compelled the rebalance to go through and to this day john will tell you it was one of his most rewarding experiences in investment management given the absolute dollar value created for the funds members as growth stocks plunged small value stocks surged and bonds steadily advanced during the bear market that eventually culminated in late 2002 when headlines lead to clients questioning their investment strategy we suggest advisors use comprehensive historical return ranges to most effectively gauge recent results on an absolute basis and relative to a mainstream asset such as u.s equities that is the S&P500 index we will review how seemingly impaired assets are rarely permanently defunct in most cases the performance of a broken asset class is well within its range of historical returns and outperformance often follows a period of underperformance as mean reversion takes hold clients benefit from a greater understanding of the potential long-term upside in recently beaten down assets the broken asset classes before delving into our review let's begin with a few caveats first our selection of broken asset classes is far from exhaustive in making our selection we relied primarily on a global roster of historical articles published in the well-established financial press including businessweek barons the economist and financial times if your own experience includes other asset classes that have been declared broken please let us know second the headlines or conversations that question the long-term viability of an asset class represent just one opinion or voice at that time alongside those who warn and question others may have presented an opposite more favorable view contrarians are often an endangered species but rarely extinct given our survey's purpose is to show how broken asset classes typically mend themselves with time our sample emphasizes the former these are the same troubled asset classes that grab the headlines grip the attention of investors and lead to tough questions for advisors from their clients and finally we are restricted by the availability of return data although we use well-known proxies with an extended return history few asset classes other than u.s stocks and high-yield bonds have a monthly series longer than a half-century a notable example is emerging market stocks in our study we use a return history for em stocks that begins in 1985.""]"

then that whales are not accumulating at these price levels and is a bearish but wait enhance more hold it run that back wait a minute go right there freeze that full screen we've seen another reversal to the rapid decline of bitcoin whale wallets so they have been accumulating on this dip below fifty thousand dollars although tentatively much like the miners they too seem to be a little hesitant so next up institutions are they accumulating right now this one is much harder to track a purchase could be made directly from a miner and we would never even know about it however coinbase has let everyone know that hey by the way we were the guys michael saylor went to for his bitcoin purchases which if he then shared his playbook with elon means tesla probably went there too imagine michael just told elon to go to coinbase.com and buy from there wait what but this does make it a little bit easier to find out what institutions are actually doing with their bitcoin which is potentially the most important indicator for the mid to long term health of bitcoin right now according to data from crypto quant tracking the amount of bitcoin being transferred out of coinbase pro wallets there has been a strong accumulation below 50 000 february 24th at 48 000 per bitcoin saw 13 000 bitcoin leave the exchange more than half a billion dollars in a single day same again february 25th january was absolutely crazy at over 40 000 bitcoin but outside from that these two dates are as high as any previous single day records so institutions at least the ones utilizing coinbase's services which seems very popular right now are most definitely accumulating bitcoin under fifty thousand dollars very bullish which looks set to continue twitter just announced that they are seeking

trend and expecting this market to create lower lows so we continue taking a look at this market as you can see we're dropping down now and now beginning to rally still in this trend guys I want to make sure I make that a clear point I'll go ahead and take this line off so it doesn't get confusing until the market breaks this level of resistance right here I am considering this market in a downtrend these are just the rules that I've created to personally identify trend so we have this pullback again pushing up towards our resistance level but not breaking it so still we're in this downtrend and now we're pushing even lower and here we are at current day and currently this markets pushed up so right now guys we're just in this period of consolidation on the pound Ozzy we're looking at this area in through here as our consolidation area now on this specific time frame because of this consolidation we see that doesn't mean that I'm gonna be looking for a bearish trade when I see markets that look like this I just avoid them all together until the market shows me what it wants to do until the market shows me it's going to continue this downtrend by breaking the low then after the mortgage shows me what it wants to do I'll look for my next opportunity to go short or another possibility is that this market pushes up and breaks above our resistance level and in that case I'll be looking for a new long opportunity so when markets start to consolidate like this I just wait for the market to tell me what direction it wants to go another thing that's very important and can be very beneficial to trading strategies and guys I am considering producing a video that will explain multiple time frame analysis and which time frames you should pay the most attention to when it comes to structure levels and trend and what I'm gonna do is when this video gets 500 likes that's when I'll produce the multiple time frame video because I want to make sure there's enough people that are interested in that topic before I do so"", ""it's a signal of a pending change and if there's not then it's a further confirmation of the trend so you can see here confirmation if you follow the line up they're moving together you can see there if you follow a line across and up that they're diverging there so again not too relevant today tenant 5 is that trends must be confirmed by volume so this one is still very rare even today and something that old technical traders place heavy weight on normally is looking at volume in conjunction with their trend analysis what Dowell is saying here is that there's a lot of reasons why price can move on low volume one trader could come in the market and jerk the price around you know it's impossible to tell really but if the price increase or decrease is accompanied by large volume that means there's lots of participants in the move and therefore that's the further confirmation of the trend that's in place so you can see here chart at Google you can see the uptrend there that's in place initially it's on rising volume and then it continues to rise but on falling volume so without looking at any other information just looking at ten at five we'd have to start to call this trend and to question it actually did sell-off shortly thereafter 10 at 6 is that trends exist until definitive signals prove that they have ended and this is kind of where the debate of technical analysis and the study of technical analysis take us in terms of trying to determine what those signals are that prove the the trends have ended so we're going to look at that in the lessons that come specifically in the next lesson we're going to look at support and resistance and look further into trends and price action around certain levels created by supply and demand imbalances so I hope you'll join us for that one that's it for today's lesson if you have any questions please feel free to visit us at inform trades comm or leave

recover and it's the same thing if we're moving down if we're moving downwards and we get that and we break the zero six one eight it means we might be reversing and we might not continue that actual move and flow so you basically want to use this to your structures you want to be using this with your rsis with your mas as well and at least it gives you a zone on where you could be setting limits

that tool and i needed previous data to use that tool now what happens if i don't have any more previous data meaning now this has now really started to break out into price discovery this is where i like to use the the fibonacci tool again but now we're going to be using it in the different sort of direction this is where the 1618 becomes a really key gold zone for you for some sort of take profit level um so if we have a look over here if we were trending to the downward side and i was buying in these levels""]"

clear double top in that yesterday's video actually so it would it did hit that Surplus that support didn't hold we had a very strong support here on the monthly at 1 295 and that didn't hold so

here we have a broadening wedge a rising broadening wedge unfortunately burning which is actually it's not rising or falling so it's not giving us any definitive answer of where it's going but it does look like we are on a major support here you can see we came down bounced off 900 went all the way up to 2000 went came down 1 200 pounds 1600 came down to 1900 during the FTX crash and now we're getting a bounce we're on a broadening Rising wedge um it's a megaphone usually they they can go any direction when it's not it's it's symmetrical megaphone if it's pointing down it could if the

only have one die in my wallet because I have a pending transaction but if you had available funds you can of course set the leverage here um and open uh limit order on ethereum either short or long and there's many other assets I think that's one of the major draw cards of games it's that you have many other assets to take advantage on so overall pretty clean pretty easy user experience when it comes to opening trades and that's why I like it and of course it will be on arbitrim soon so you'll have polygon and arbitrim that you can trade on remember if you do want to trade on games Network there is a link in the description of course use the link in the description if you want to do any trading and I'm going to try and get a giveaway sort of for you guys that actually sign up you just simply click on my referral link it is the first link in the description and you can start trading on G trade right here let's get into the Vault side of things because not all of you are Traders now of course one of the ways to capture exposure to games without trading yourself is actually via providing liquidity one of the ways to do this is via staking die in the G vault which is currently paying a 4.1 apy and is also now launched on arbitrum so you can do so on arbitrim or polygon as gains starts to roll out onto the arbitrant network as well if you stake die you are essentially representing your ownership in the vault so stakers of dire receive fees for each trade placed on the platform in exchange for serving as the counterparty to all trades obviously to power trades on the network they need liquidity so if you provide liquidity the people that are trading on the other side are using your liquidity to essentially be paid out and processed transactions if the Traders lose money the people that are staking to the Vault the liquidity providers they earn more if the Traders make money then the gdivault becomes less profitable but the theory is here that Traders actually aren't profitable and because the house always wins over time the stakers in the G diver will make more money as more people use the platform and there's more fees now of course there are risks where it comes when it comes to oracle-based dexes um and one of one of the major risks is that some kind of expert Point um or profitable trading strategy which wipes the pool be aware of that risk I'm just showing you guys the platform and giving you the option to stake if you are bullish on games and if you choose to do so I'm not necessarily saying that you have to of course you can just trade on the platform like everyone else but if you wanted to take it a step further and you like the platform and you're bullish on the platform then one way to capture exposure is through the G dive Vault the other way to capture exposure is of course through the gns pool which pays out to stakers based on how much fees the platform is earning and if we look at June analytics we can see that daily trade volume has been steadily increasing over time as well as users and obviously fees are represented in die have also increased despite dropping from last year but considering it's a bear Market this has been a pretty solid performance for gains Network and I think it's just off the back of having like a very usable product and I think it's launch on arbitrim that can also be a potential Catalyst to get more users into the platform and I think it holds it in much better stead uh long term being on arbitrim as well so of course if you do want to uh want to purchase DNS and stake it and capture upside to that then you can do so under their staking um section here you can buy gns if you click this button it will take you to Quick swap to buy gns you can approve it and then stake it as well and if you want to bridge funds across from polygon to arbitrim to stake on arbitrim they've got a bridge if you click on the bridge tab here which allows you to bridge assets across once again I want to make it clear that I'm not paid to promote the gns token or the staking my primary goal here is to show you guys how to use the platform but obviously part of that is showing you how to use the staking functions as well""]"

States the upshot would be in the short term at any rate a lot of pain for the issuer pain for the exchanges and pain for investors however that's not to say that it would be the end of the line especially if as is likely more and more cryptos fall into the Securities bucket as a result of the precedent that has now been set there is strength in numbers after all and as issuers and exchanges plow through the paperwork perhaps we could get closer to a world where crypto is able to exist under the watchful eye of the SEC and the ludicrous system of Regulation by enforcement that we're seeing today could become a thing of the past assuming investor protection isn't taken too far and assuming some sensible pro-crypto regulations do eventually get passed in the United States then it's not impossible to imagine a future where crypto is allowed to exist and evolve in a way that's agreeable to most parties it's not all sunshine and Roses of course smaller crypto projects and exchanges could find it even harder to survive and thrive when it becomes necessary to devote sizable chunks of their workforces to merely staying compliant"", ""so they listen to the fans they get 10 of the

on November the 15th three hours after the market open you're viewing my desktop showing you the trade ideas artificial intelligence one-of-a-kind technology that lives on our website and of course you can download it through our application trade ideas Pro AI this is what it does that that's different from other vendors in finance so the idea is that we find these statistical opportunities that are triggered by either past analysis that the AI has done or read more recent specific statistical setups today but the bottom line is if you look at the percentages the percentage opportunities that were able to find it's pretty evident that even when you take small losses which you have there is no technology that gives individuals the kind of opportunities and the percentages that are possible with what we're doing at trade ideas which then I have to just ask myself it's crazy that the online brokers haven't even done the research to take a look at what we're doing nobody's really bothered to even spend the time to see if it works or if it doesn't that's the thing that probably is the oddest to us the innovators in in FinTech and in big data and artificial intelligence that is that primarily all the innovation all the interest has been on the individual side because obviously there's no vendor that provides this kind of tech it's ironic that you know I remember in the 90s when Schwab was so worried about how technology could be disruptive they bought cyber Trader for half a billion in 2000 thinking that that was going to be the future well turns out that they were right"", ""hello trade ideas users going to do a little outside the box thinking video here on how we can use simulated trading in a couple of fashions one simulated trading to practice auto trading setting auto strategies letting those run while we're here at the desk monitoring and seeing how those do and at the same time we can use these auto strategies that are running in their open p l total p l columns as a watch list of today to give us ideas while we're sitting in front of the computer and just to interpret the data in another way so first thing i'd like to do here is show any user that doesn't know how to already connecting a strategy so simply if you go to a brokerage plus tab here if you don't have one open you can find that here in new and come to brokerage plus that is where we'll open that from i have one open already and it will look something like this each person may design theirs a little differently by changing the columns much less you can change the columns on the ai by right clicking the window and you'll see the columns here and here just like with the ai you have the master list on the right the selected list or the viewed list on the left and you can move them by selecting clicking left to right or right to left so on and so forth until you have the configuration that you like to have across here displaying the data that you like we are not during live market hours however during the live market hours i get my drawing tool out here this open p l column here for you that's going to have what your active p l is in each one of these positions for you and it's a great way to take a look at the data that's coming in what is working what is not working and this way you can also maybe tune down the noise not having too many windows running at once you know the old saying analysis paralysis so during the day we're tracking these stocks you may see in the blue here things that have been moving up there in the positive we show the bad two here things that we're moving down so what i did today was i took a strategy that i have been working on for some auto trading and we come to the strategies tab"", ""so let's sit back and see what the trading day has in store for us orders are now being sent to the market these orders are initiated from alerts generated from the trade ideas alerting application we've modeled six strategies three long and three short which have been extensively back tested in the odds maker an add-on tool to trade ideas pro having the detailed historical success ratios of our strategies gives us the confidence necessary to run the robot unmanned here's a sample of what the oddsmaker output looks like aside from the success ratio of the strategies over the past 15 days it displays the average winning trade amount the average losing trade amount your net winnings had you been trading one share increments the best trade the worst trade and the consistency the results also break down the number of points made or lost including the number of trades generated on each of the 15 days analyzed one minute into the market open our resolve is certainly being tested we're quickly down over seven hundred dollars we're currently in 44 positions 37 long and seven short we're continuing to put on trades for the next 45 seconds so we're not going to concern ourselves with these unrealized losses right now you see our total downside is protected because we automatically place a protective stop on every position that we have at this point we've been stopped out of two positions for a total realized loss of 104 dollars minimizing our downside and diversifying our risk are keys to our long-term success there are 15 seconds to go before we stop any new orders we're down a total of about 600 dollars in both open and closed positions we've been filled on a total of 57 trades utilizing approximately two hundred thousand dollars in buying power using a default of 200 share orders a total of 8101 shares are currently open we do not send our orders out as all or none so we may have partial fills our open positions have stabilized down five hundred dollars off its biggest drawdown of just over nine hundred dollars using the odds maker we've optimized our hold time on these strategies to that of 15 minutes i'm gonna go ahead and stay focused on the p l while i time lapse this video our blotter just turned positive after a small gap down opening we filled the gap and are continuing to move higher we're in far more long positions than short positions with just a couple of minutes until our

the answer sir is yes do you think you and the SEC have had a role to play in that I think we have a role to protect the American investor and the capital markets and reclaiming my time sir you have played an obvious role in that biggest crypto failure in history is probably FTX at nine billion dollars sir were you the chairman of the SEC when FTX collapsed yes does it concern you by the way that your approach to the digital asset industry is actually driving this industry out of the United States we're trying to drive it to compliance and if they're not complying with the laws then they shouldn't be offering their products reclaiming my time uh Madam chair I would like to enter into the record this Wall Street Journal article from April 14 2023 detailing China's ploy to open its banking system to crypto firms in an effort to seize an opportunity created by our hostile regulatory environment which uh Mr chair you're a big part of so Gary claims that his role is to protect the American people and of course I've got to ask Gary who did you protect did you protect the people at Voyager or block or maybe did you protect the FTX customers no Gary because FTX was your buddy Sam bickman freed you hung out with him you have not protected the American people all he has been doing is filing these Wells notices against companies like coinbase and against cryptos that a lot of us are invested in and here's what that Wells notice is it's an essentially an inquiry or an indictment that something has gone wrong and it really begins the process of putting these companies and these developers in a state of fear"", ""anyhow let's go back to that phrase Paul used potential violations of Securities laws it's pretty open-ended but it does suggest that the SEC could well be going after coinbase as part of its wider Crusade against proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies you'll doubtless recall that SEC chairman Gary Gensler suggested that proof-of-state cryptos could be Securities on the very day of ethereum's merge last September Gary has doubled down on this in recent weeks and the SEC scored a significant Victory on this front back in February when Kraken agreed to stop offering its staking services and pay a 30 million dollar fine I imagine the sec's legal team has already earmarked those funds for the upcoming tussle with coinbase because remember folks when the lawsuits start flying the real winners are always the lawyers and indeed the day after the wells noticed news broke coinbase announced via its help page that it would be moving to unchain staking for a number of assets meaning that customers would quote earn rewards from the protocol not coinbase coinbase acts only as a service provider connecting you the validators and the protocol so coinbase is clearly starting to get its ducks in a row although crypto slate speculated that this may have been in the works for a while now quote it is unclear whether the actions are related to the Wells notice that coinbase has received from Securities regulators statements from coinbase today suggest that the changes were scheduled as early as March the 10th prior to its receipt of that notice it is possible that the changes were influenced by coinbase's February warning that the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC intends to take action against retail staking products now as you can no doubt imagine the news of the sec's move against coinbase has been received about as well as the press release for Logan Paul's next nft project the war against crypto in the United States is dragging more and more entities into the Maelstrom and the SEC clearly isn't afraid of going after the big players so one inevitable question is who's next will ethereum be in the crosshairs once Shanghai goes live next month an unstaking becomes possible or will Gary and Co choose to go after another proof of stake crypto instead however today I want to ask another question one that I'm sure a few of you may have been wondering yourselves what if the SEC is successful in its arguments that most cryptos beside Bitcoin are securities what if it wins its case against Ripple and gets the wind in its sales to go after other altcoins let's put aside questions around proof of stake for the time being xrp isn't proof of State crypto remember and instead assume that the SEC is able to successfully argue that the expectation of profit from investing in altcoins comes from the efforts of identifiable third parties what happens then would it be the end of days for crypto in the USA or are we getting our panties in a Twist over a great big nothing Burger so with the help of Kevin one of our research team here at coinbiro I decided to find out so let's assume the worst has happened Gary's got his way and an altcoin has been officially designated as a security now I suppose I could use a particular crypto as an example here"", ""I'll add that the mining difficulty has also increased the break-even price is now close to 20K anywho the fourth part of the report is about regulations the authors note that U.S politicians are preparing stablecoin regulations which we covered in a recent video and that the G20 is working on a global crypto framework they also touch on the eu's mica crypto regulations which were finally passed just recently I'll quickly note that the financial stability board or FSB will be releasing Global crypto regulation recommendations this summer for context the FSB is an unaccountable and unelected organization closely aligned with U.S interests and it looks like its recommendations will be very anti-crypto now what's awesome is that the authors provide an amazing visualization of mica's key Provisions the most important one is that D5 protocols will not be regulated so long as they are sufficiently decentralized unfortunately the EU seems to be working on D5 specific regulations too make no mistake crypto regulations are required for the next crypto bull run to begin luckily there are many places that are in the process of passing Pro crypto regulations and not just the EU the authors note this in their forecast these crypto regulations will increase crypto's legitimacy and I couldn't help but notice that the authors provided a score for each of these crypto niches surprisingly the scores for Bitcoin defy and Mining were all four out of five not surprisingly the score for regulation is two and this makes me wonder what categories 5 and 1 look like in the eyes of the authors on that note the fifth part of the report is about derivatives which the authors put down as a three out of five they reiterate that the cme's Bitcoin option Futures have hit record levels of open interest they also note that the annualized basis yield for BTC suggests that investors are becoming more uncertain for reference the BTC annualized basis yield quote represents the cost or benefit of holding a long position in Bitcoin Futures and can provide insight into the market sentiment of Futures Traders as you can see this yield has been declining signaling a potentially bearish short-term trend this relates to the author's forecast wherein they note that bullish Traders are betting on btc's price to be 32k at the end of May and bearish Traders are betting on btc's price to be 25k at the end of May specifically the 26th of May the authors note that these were the same targets Traders had last month now I'd be remiss if I didn't mention all the volatility that's being caused by leveraged trading these days if you've been keeping up with our weekly crypto reviews you'll know that long liquidations and short squeezes have been primary drivers of price action in recent weeks and this seems to be getting worse what this means is that you need to be very careful when you're trading and be aware of all the key levels that your favorite cryptos could go to if they pump or dump and if you have no idea what key levels are I suggest subscribing to coin Bureau trading Dan will tell you everything you need to know the link is up in the top right now the sixth part of the report is about venture capital or VC the authors restate that VC investing went up by 170 in April totaling almost 900 million dollars the breakdown of where all that money went can be seen here While most of the deals were in defy most of the money went to infrastructure the authors underscore a whopping 220 million dollar investment in core weave a quote specialized cloud provider however it's not entirely clear if core weave is a crypto project it doesn't seem to have a white paper or token but Ico drops notes that it will be selling an erc20 token soon take note in their forecast the author's cautioned that although the month-over-month increase in VC investing is impressive it's not a trend this can clearly be seen in the infographic they provide crypto VC investing fell off a cliff last year and hasn't yet recovered even so there's still lots of money being thrown around the authors stress that crypto VC investment is heavily dependent on macro factors namely interest rates so long as the FED continues to keep rates High speculative VC investing will be minimal and this further underscores the fact that the crypto projects raising money now are very high quality take note I'll also quickly note that the authors gave this crypto Niche a 4 out of 5 which again begs the question of what a five looks like now the seventh part of the report is about nfts the authors note that quote there are concerns

trading for relatively high valuations are going to die out in a year to five years it's just the truth it's the reason why I ice tried it to tell you all diversification is necessary in crypto currencies and that you simply cannot just buy something low and think oh don't worry I don't have to set a stoploss I can just simply buy something and not have to worry about it because I'm buying it on the low end and all crypto goes up that's not right that's excessively off course of a true investor you have to understand that we are living in something very similar to duck on the.com level

looks like the total like cryptocurrency market valuation kind of what we're going through right now now of course I think crypto currencies have a ways to go but the dot-com era was when internet first came out it was when internet really started to see we started to see some potential in the internet we started seeing websites popping up and people really engaging with personal computers the same things going on with cryptocurrency right now there's a lot of excitement and a lot of FOMO to get into the general industry not only investing but also creating new icos creating new blockchain projects that are getting valued at tens hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions so we have to consider the fact that usually what you know can come up like this can come crashing down as well

potential for crypto options one of the biggest markets for crypto options has to be from institutional investors and miners the letter to finance operations and the former to protect or enhance crypto portfolios previously large option contracts used to only be traded over-the-counter or through swap dealers dealers such as ledger X structured bespoke option deals that saw some hedge fund traders make millions like the example of this guy who bought Bitcoin options for 1 million dollars in December of 2017 these options had a strike price of $50,000 and an expiry date at the end of 2018 the bet didn't work out too well for him but at least he didn't put his on the line like John McAfee anyways the problem with these OTC option contracts is that sometimes the dealer can't find a counterpart to their trade the OTC market is chunky and idiosyncratic this is where Exchange listed option contracts have an advantage these markets are more liquid as the contracts are standardized hence it's a lot easier for institutions to structure trades Bitcoin options are now being offered in listed form on a few exchanges in December of last year trading began on quarterly Bitcoin options are backed for those who don't know backed was the first regulated futures exchange to offer physically settled Bitcoin futures not one to be left behind in January of 2020 the CME announced the launch of their own listed Bitcoin options contracts there was a lot of anticipation for the launch of these options as open interest in the CM e futures markets spiked just before the rollout on the first day of live trading volume on the CME exchange exceeded all the volume that was traded on backs since its launch last year what's driving the demand"", ""do i have a story to tell you this is

acquire and deal volume plummets when markets are in free fall most private equity investors will wait for things to settle before resuming deal flow instead of buying the most distressed assets at the optimal time investors with large p e allocations therefore find their capital flows are pro-cyclical they invest with the most money when debt is cheap and multiples are high and the least money during times and spread is wide and valuations are low even for the most prepared and disciplined investor reacting in times to rising high yield spreads would be extremely challenging as we mentioned previously equity returns are maximized in the two to three months after high yield spreads hit six and a half it will be near impossible for a private equity investor to deploy meaningful amounts of capital into multiple opportunities in two to three months when borrowing rates for debt are rising in terms of returns private equity of integer returns are significantly higher in years when the high yield spread is over six and a half percent the average irr for a vintage year where spreads averaged above six is seventeen percent versus twelve percent for a vintage year when spreads average below that but if we compare vintage year returns and twelve month forward returns on the cambridge associate's pe index to form a fringe value or our multi-factor model which we'll describe below we see the performance is significantly worse in summary while private equity seems like it should be an ideal asset class to take advantage of these opportunities higher borrowing costs short windows of opportunities and high degrees of uncertainty prevent private equity from acting distressed debt distress debt would seemingly be the optimal asset class to take advantage of times of financial distress distressed funds will opportunistically invest in the debt equity or trade claims of companies in financial distress are already in default distress funds can take advantage of these opportunities by buying stakes at considerable discount given this mandate they should outperform during periods of uncertainty however the performance of distressed funds lag even the triple c index the multi-factor equity model we discuss below outperforms distress debt by four and a half times in the most optimistic case distress funds may be outperforming the triple c index before fees but the fact remains the returns lag far behind equities distressed investing underperforms multi-factor model because the multi-factor model is buying companies that are cheap and healthy whereas the distressed debt funds are buying businesses that are in an unhealthy precarious high bankruptcy risk situation with a lower default or bankruptcy rate than distress fund portfolios it should be no surprise that the multi-factor model performs in summary neither p e nor distressed debt funds are the right vehicles to take advantage of these opportunities given the significant outperformance of small value equities during these time periods a dedicated public small value exposure is the optimal way to capitalize on these moments however deciding to allocate to public small value during these times is not enough to ensure the capital is put to work during these events funds should commit to having a dedicated allocation that is drawn down when high yield spreads at a certain threshold similar to pe this would suggest that even during the most trying times investors have the discipline and structure in place to take advantage of these truly unique opportunities"", ""but then of course you have researchers and different economists claiming that we will see US economy experience a major crash by 2020 and something else we need to understand that everyone is acknowledging the issue but no one is really doing anything about it so many people have acknowledges the fact that US has a huge debt problem but what why is no one acting on it so the debt problem of the u.s. mentioned by Kim does come has been shared by both economists and government agencies like the International Monetary Fund which recently emphasized that the US has to stop ignoring the seriousness of its federal debt held by the public even if you think that public that just doesn't matter to economic outcomes the thing that you have to admit is that when we hit a downturn which might happen soon that is absolutely true if you read the Ray Dalio if you looked at Ray Dalio is famous video about how the economic machine works we are a juice for a downturn and everything is in cycles when it comes to economies when you have a credit based economy as we currently have in the Western world it always goes in cycles because as soon as you borrow money as soon as you take credit you automatically create a future where you will have to pay it back where you need to cut your expenses and when you cut your expenses you're not paying the people you used to pay and they need to cut their expenses and they're not paying people they used to pay and so everyone just comes back so cycles are just inevitable and at that time governments are less likely to take significant steps if the debt is as high as ours is now so quite interesting development and the team that come has really been fighting this situation and you know he's really on a mission to fight the US because he feels that they really you know messed him up if you read kim.com story you realize why he is so passionate towards you know replacing the US dollar and things like that because he really has had a lot of problems with the US government and just us authorities and so it's going to be interesting to follow this of course but you need to understand that the timeline is important here I mean who knows how long time it will take whether it's ten years twenty thirty fifty but definitely something to keep in mind and as long as we know that this is unsustainable as long as we can prepare ourselves I think we are in a good position so that is news number one number two we're going to discuss Sweden because Sweden may be the first country that completely switches to digital cash so this is quite interesting because in Sweden you have the situation that no one is really paying with cash no one wants to handle cash you know it's annoying you have like bills you have all these coins you need to handle people don't like that people are generally you know they like technology they are high-tech so they embrace all the new stuff all the new mobile payments all of the new you know touchless payments all of that so in that sense the Swedish people really embrace the new payments technology at the same time you realize that more and more of the economy is switching to private banks private banks controlling everything because if you're not a private bank customer you do not have a bank account you cannot buy anything currently you still can I mean currently there is still possibilities to spend cash but there are very very limited I mean practically you can say that you cannot spend spend cash because you know so many so many grocery stores nowadays so many coffee shops just say we don't accept cash we only accept cards and the central bank doesn't like that that is something to realize the central bank really doesn't like the development and many private banks are now refusing to take cash at all they're refusing to handle cash and so the central bank really sees this as a threat to the nation's economy threat to the nation's stability when everything is in the hands of a few private corporations namely a few private banks that basically dominate the swedish banking market and for several years Sweden has been developing this a crown system so you know this Swedish currency is called Karuna and this is equally a crooner like you know electronic Karuna and so now we have some updates on the situation they released a second report the central bank of Sweden Riggs Bank and and basically the outline that you know what in 2018 only 13% of of people that they surveyed paid in cash for the recent purchased and just eight years ago this number was 39% so only 13% paid in cash for their recent purchase and they also outlined that you know the mission of the central bank is to provide the general public with money and going forwards the technical development and decentralization of payments will bring the issue of the state's role to to a head basically they need to provide stability they need to provide a payments market that is functioning well and you realize that if they do not act so they write if you know not to act in the face of current developments and completely leave the payment market to private agents a few private banks we will ultimately leave the general public entirely dependent on a private payment solution you can find the link in the description for this and you realize also there is an issue that comes to state on the digital cash I mean a stent is state operated and state owned digital cash obviously cash has always been created by the state but now when you move it to the digital form it becomes kind of scary because what if the state doesn't like you like it's a simple question what if in the future you have some kind of dictatorship you never who will be ruling the country in the future and so I think you always need to ask yourself what will happen if suddenly you go to the wrong meeting you go to the wrong political party you go to the wrong protest and the state can basically freeze your account with your cash and so we've never seen this before we've never seen these kinds of development before at all and Sweden is a country that likes to experiment with money that is something we need to understand because Sweden was the first country to establish a central bank at all"", ""2021 annual report suggests that it only has around 120 billion dollars in its Insurance Fund this is a drop in the bucket compared to the 19 trillion dollars of Bank deposits in the U.S and a speck of sand in the desert of the derivatives Market which could be in the quadrillions luckily there's the third rule of bank balins which states that you will be given some alternative asset in exchange for your lost deposits now believe it or not but these alternative assets are typically shares in the bank that you bailed out let that sink in the bank takes your money and gives you its worthless stock in return not only that but if governments manage to pass laws to make Central Bank digital currencies or cbdc's legal tender you could very well be paid back in cbdc instead of cash come to think of it bank balance would be the perfect way to force people to adopt cbdc's and perhaps that's the whole point speculation aside it's important to note that you could temporarily lose access to your funds during a bank Balin as we've seen with Cyprus Banks could put limits on their hours of operations limits on payments limits on transfers and limits on cash withdrawals until the bail in process is complete more evidence comes from a bank Balin document from the Bank of Scotland which suggests that it could take up to a week for you to get your insured deposits back I imagine there would be a similar lag for other banks around the world make no mistake the social unrest that would trigger would be truly unprecedented now the people in power appear to be hyper aware of this because they've apparently been running Bank Balin simulations for years the most recent high-profile Bank simulation was held by the FDIC in November last year although the FDIC simulation is publicly available it's predictably hard to find the simulation featured dozens of panelists from prominent financial institutions and Regulators that you've probably never heard of as you might have guessed one of them was Wilson Irvin who seems to keep a very low profile these days despite or maybe because of being the Chief Architect of the bank Balin process now I'll leave a link to the full simulation in the description if you're interested but I'll reiterate that it's hard to find even with the link I'll also caution that it's lengthy and contains lots of financial jargon in any case the most exciting stuff begins around the one hour mark Snippets from this section went viral at roughly 1 hour and 18 minutes one of the panelists Ponders how the FDIC and its secret allies should maintain the Public's confidence in the financial system when the balines inevitably happen she argues that transparency is the answer but that some entities should get more transparency than others this particular panelist also made an off-the-cuff comment about making sure the public understands that quote prior compensation could be clawed back now maybe I'm hearing things but that sounds like it's possible for the banks to take your money long after the bailing process has been completed she even asked the other panelists how they can quote address excess cash use in such a crisis this suggests that governments could very well be planning on introducing a cbdc using bank balins then again it could just be a reference to the freeze on cash withdrawals I was talking about earlier as a cherry on top the panelist also said that they should quote make the announcement on a Friday ideally a Friday night for context Fridays are famous for being one of the days when nobody pays attention to the news hence why bad news often comes out on Fridays the more you know a second panelist agreed with the first about being selective with transparency about the bailin and specified that they should tell the banks and big investors first he said they shouldn't tell the public until later because they would Panic a third panelist agreed with the second and said something sinister along the lines of the public has more faith in the banking system than we do let's keep it that way the other panelists laughed he went on to repeat that only institutional investors should know what's going on and they should quote be careful with what we tell the public but wait there's more a fourth panelist then said something even more Sinister I had to listen to it three times because I couldn't quite believe what I was hearing the timestamp is around 1 hour and 27 minutes she literally says quote the information should go out once we're moving out of the recession make of that what you will this fourth panelist went on to explain that non-bank entities including cryptocurrency exchanges should be included in the bailing process now this could mean that she wants them to be subject to acquisition by big Banks or that she wants to use the crypto you hold on exchanges to bail them in a little later Wilson said that they must make sure that disinformation about bank balins doesn't get out before the fact check approved version of events he even went as far as suggesting that this online censorship should happen in advance so that people don't talk about their money being taken it just so happens that governments around the world are in the process of rolling out exactly these kinds of online censorship laws and most of them will be going into Force later this year or next year you can find out all about that using the link in the description I strongly suggest watching

shouldn't be getting hammered right so why then are you seeing such across-the-board contractions well it's because people simply don't have the money they had a year or two ago to spend on Goods but

the covet pandemic not good folks not good at all or as our angry Bingo grandma says nothing has ever been better"", ""in the paper bernard said that the great depression made no sense because quote factories warehouses and fields are still intact and are ready to produce in unlimited quantities but the urge to go ahead has been paralyzed by a decline in buying power and by extension a decline in demand given this situation bernard proposed the following solution quote i would have the government assign a lease of life to shoes and homes and machines to all products of manufacture mining and agriculture when they are first created and they would be sold and used within the term of their existence definitely known by the consumer after the allotted time had expired these things would be legally dead and would be controlled by the duly appointed governmental agency and destroyed if there is widespread unemployment in other words everything produced in the economy would be artificially made obsolete by the government at a certain date to cause the population to consume more so that the economy recovers while simultaneously providing ample employment further fostering economic growth now if you watched our video about how to prepare for the crypto bear market you'll know that it was the second world war that arguably ended the great depression and bernard's problematic idea of planned obsolescence never really caught on as a result this is primarily because the post-war period was one of incredible prosperity particularly for the united states as it managed to reap much of the rewards of victory while incurring little in the way of losses compared with its allies the u.s dollar had also just become the world's reserve currency more importantly the populations of countries like the united states and canada exploded after the second world war creating the army of well-off old folks many of us now refer to as boomers this is important because the rapid increase in population meant there was a rapid increase in consumption and that meant that there was no need for planned obsolescence business practices companies could comfortably sell high quality hardware that would last for decades because they knew there would always be another wave of buyers coming next year as more baby boomers became adult boomers this seems to have been the case until the 1970s when it became clear that baby boomers weren't having nearly the same number of children as their forebears it appears that many western countries tried to fill this future demographic gap by opening their doors to immigration and this seems to have worked for a while by the early 2000s however it became clear that immigration alone wasn't enough to fill the future demographic gap which of course continued to grow as companies needed ever more future consumption to continue their future expansion all the while native birth rates continued to decline this seems to be the period when bernard's idea of planned obsolescence started to become a reality companies were effectively forced into selling low quality products that would require a repurchase every few years to continue consumption trends in the absence of a growing population now i know what you're thinking guy this is all very interesting but what does this have to do with me owning nothing and being happy""]"

uh UOB would have been worth um they would have been worth uh 234k uh just when it was at like 280 yesterday so are these coins going to be this much how how many people are actually going to do kyc that have mined the coins is there actually a much smaller circulating Supply after the kyc is all done than beforehand uh not really sure but here's here's what I know about Pi Network at this point

I've had a big video back in 2020 that had like 150 000 views on it that's where I picked up all my referrals"", ""so we've talked a bit about centralized exchanges now we want to dive into decentralized exchanges now a decentralized exchange is vastly different than a centralized exchange and I'm going to be very upfront with you it's not anything I would encourage you to use right now I'm none of these uh and and you're going to be tempted the deeper you get into crypto uh the deeper you see some of the gain potential of some of the tokens readily available on these decentralized exchanges um you know often you're going to be able to get first crack at uh launch tokens for particular projects you might be interested in but there are a lot of issues with decentralized exchanges in my opinion uh number one they are to me they they feel and operate in a very insecure insecure way um one of the issues that I see on decentralized exchanges are fake tokens uh to give you an example let's say let's use cardano for example let's say cardano is launching and they're releasing their new token and they're going to do it on a decentralized exchange first well let's say I there's a big fomo rush and everybody's trying to get these uh cardano tokens it wouldn't take very much for somebody to create an artificial token that does nothing it just has the same logo the same name you can create fake tokens fairly easily uh they would obviously not have the same policy ID in the same blockchain data and so forth but very few people check that stuff when they're using any kind of exchange and ultimately you could be spending your Bitcoin or your ethereum or whatever your your primary layer one token is to buy these alt coins and not be any wiser that you're basically buying fake tokens and because it's a decentralized exchange there really isn't anybody you can call to get help or it'll say hey I just bought these fake tokens""]"

described above if the conditions to parents and acquisition Subs obligations to complete the merchant are merger are satisfied and Elon Musk basically fails to consummate the merger as required including because of the following Equity debt and or margin financing is not funded Elon Musk parent will be required to pay a termination fee of 1 billion dollars now this is really interesting because at first I thought the three reasons he'd be able to cancel would actually just be two it'd basically just be if margin isn't funded or debt isn't funded but let's break these down one at a time and see where there's an interesting potential loophole maybe for Elon Musk so first debt financing isn't funded Elon Musk right now has about a 13 billion dollar loan uh commitment from Morgan Stanley and it is one heck of an expensive loan or at least it has gotten very expensive here is the section that talks about the interest rate from the debt financing commitment letter and it shows us that Elon Musk pays approximately sofr plus 4.75 or 4.5 let's just go conservative and say 4.5 percent as the spread on top of whatever sofr is well sofr has exploded it's gone from about 30 basis points to over 3 percent that means the following which I found on Twitter from this person at realmeet Kevin think interest rates going up hurts just ask Elon Musk his 12.5 billion dollar loan approximately 13."", ""Elon Musk tweeted a picture of his Sheba Inu dog this tweet directly caused Shiba inu's price to Skyrocket to all-time highs and reach a market cap of over 38 billion dollars this week musk shared a gif of a Milady nft saying there is no meme I love you which significantly impacted the non-fungible tokens performance in ways never before seen musk's simple tweet triggered the nft floor price to see a 59 percent boost over the past seven days pushing it to hit an all-time high 4 price of 7.3 ethereum worth 13 700 before it slowly fell back to 5.6 ethereum worth 10 509 a few hours later moreover musk's tweet boosted Milady sales increasing it by a factor of 500 percent over the previous 24 hours milady's recent performance also allowed it to climb to the top trending nft spot in the popular non-fungible token Marketplace Open Sea but the Tweet didn't only affect the nft collection's price it also massively impacted a crypto project with a project called Milady meme coin up over 5990 percent in the past 24 hours the token currently has a price of the number on screen right now a market cap of 148 million dollars and a 24-hour trading volume of 202 million dollars it is also the number one trending project on the crypto price tracking website coin gecko meme coin Pepe recently got to a market cap of 1.8 billion dollars if Milady mean coin were to reach the same market cap you can make over 5 500 in profit from just a 500 investment if you want to buy the project it is currently listed on the mexc exchange you can sign up through the link in my description and you will be eligible to receive free crypto it is also really important to note that on coin gecko it says please note that this project is in no way affiliated or associated with Milady the nft project please do your own research before proceeding but just because it isn't officially affiliated with the nft project doesn't mean it won't continue to go up in price whenever Elon tweets about Dogecoin it also makes sheaves price go up even though the projects aren't affiliated and the really interesting thing about this project is that according to Cone Gekko the project was made on May 9th exactly 36 hours before Elon musk's tweet this almost seems too convenient but of course this is just speculation"", ""musk said that at the time he had already received a verbal though unequivocal commitment from the Saudi fund to finance a take private deal worried that the news story would reveal the purported Accord musk said that he sent the Tweet to ensure that all investors had access to equal information the Saudis fund representative Yasir later denied through media reports and in a private text message to musk that funding was assured this is ass covering musk said of al-rumani's text it does not describe the reality of the situation so Elon is suggesting that Yasir is attempting to distance himself from any Financial culpability or liability in regards to his tweet he is is basically saying I've got nothing to do with this now I personally believe that Elon is telling the truth about the deal I'm not sure if his tweet was truly motivated though by the thought of informing shareholders or by his overgrown ego the reason I'm reviewing this is that Elon is fighting a lot of battles that I expect are going to continue to weigh on the price of the Tesla stock and that risk is something that the market is going to have to price in which in the course of time will continue to suppress the price of the stock not today but soon let's take a final look at the charts on Tesla I'm going to show you a longer view of the charts this is the weekly view which means that each candle represents a full week in the markets and as we move into the recession of 2023 it's going to be useful to see how companies are performing more broadly over the course of the much bigger picture of time the bullish view of Tesla's charts flipped to bearish in April of 2022 when the momentum of sellers took control by driving the stock below the 50 percent level on the RSI since then the Bears have dominated the stock and it's been in Decline and by the end of December 2022 Tesla became for the first time in the weekly chart oversold if you had dollar cost average that entire period you would be up at least 25 to 30 percent right now if we go purely by the charts Tesla is still in Bear territory and the trend is still down the current Spike up over the last two weeks is very likely purely a dead cat bounce before you get all fired up let me give you a technical mile marker that I'm going to be watching to change my view of that it's the 40 level on the RSI on the weekly chart this has held some weight in my view in the past and currently for Tesla it has been a barrier and it's been a support in the past when we see Tesla break close and climb above the 40 level on the RSI then we may have a confirmation of a new bullish

123,122,23,122_beat_experts_experiment_beat market,"['beat', 'experts', 'experiment', 'beat market', 'randomly', 'random', 'pick', 'upside', 'stocks', 'throwing']","[""but I still want you to be aware of the concepts that are behind finding good value in the stock market and if you find somebody who's claiming with 100% certainty on how they found a strategy to be profitable I wanted to not just walk but run in the opposite direction just not before smashing the like button on this video please to further discourage you from trying to find individual stocks I want to share with you guys a research study that was published in 1973 from the University of Princeton by Professor Burton Malkiel he suggested that he could find a group of blindfolded monkeys that would throw darts at the pages of a financial newspaper and those monkeys could randomly select a portfolio that would perform just as well as one carefully selected by experts of course he was wrong because the monkeys didn't do as well as the experts they did better than the experts so they ran this theory dating all the way back to 1964 to the recent present 100 monkeys throwing darts every single year and what they found was that 98 out of a hundred times the monkeys beat the experts when I first heard about this I couldn't believe it"", ""and they found that their monkey portfolio consistently beat the stock market by an average of 1.7 percent a year 96 of the time and it doesn't even stop there a goldfish's stock picks were simulated over a thousand times and beat the market by an average of 14.5 percent over three years there's also a cat who beat the market by eight percent a monkey named adam who beat jim cramer a chimpanzee who beat 94 of russian bankers and even a crypto trading hamster who beat warren buffett believe it or not there's actually a formulated reason why animals are able to get such a high return and it has nothing to do with luck chance or a secret world of headless chickens is depicted in south park instead it has to do with the strategy being used to pick stocks that tend to do well consistently over and over again and here's what they discovered research conducted in 2013 found that by randomly selecting 30 stocks out of the top 1 000 companies and buying them all in equal proportions you're increasing the chances that such a portfolio would contain smaller stocks which have the potential for even higher growth and because monkeys didn't get emotional and panic sell the moment jim cramer comes out with a spooky headline that led to an outperformance of the entire market year after year as proof of this between 1980 and 2015 smaller stocks returned 11.24 annual growth on average while large stocks returned eight percent so that just means when 30 stocks are picked at random while investing an equal amount in each you're more likely to include smaller stocks which would boost the portfolio's return when compared to an overall index and uh oops voila you beat the market now even though this sounds like the ideal way to invest before i have boo pick another 10 stocks for 2022 you're probably wondering well graham if it's really that easy then why is it everybody doing it"", ""it's not just random luck either because so many animals have proven to beat the market time and time again that a year ago i created my own experiment where i personally invested a hundred thousand dollars in 10 randomly picked stocks by the youtube monkey boo and guess what to my surprise at the end of the year the youtube monkey generated a 41 return and beat the entire S&P500 by 13 so even though michael reeve's algorithm i mean goldfish seems really really impressive just like a magic trick it's all an illusion and as it turns out there's a very simple reason why all of these animal portfolios do so incredibly well see when people pick stocks they do so by trying to profit from inefficiencies in the market that just means that they pick stocks which should in theory be worth more in the future based on their growth fundamentals projected earnings seasonality and trends so if professionals have all of these resources available at their disposal to pick the next big opportunities why can't they on a consistent basis better than an animal well that's what brings us to what's called the efficient market hypothesis this argues that the stock market makes no room for excess profits because everything is already fairly and accurately priced in or in other words stocks cannot be undervalued because its current price already includes its future growth value and earnings so the only way to make more money is by choosing riskier investments where the upside is directly proportional to the chance that you will lose money now of course there are investors like peter lynch or warren buffett who have outperformed the market over multiple decades but others argue that out of your probability at any given point in a market with enough people some will outperform the mean otherwise a winning strategy would only work until enough people figure it out at which point it would no longer be effective because everyone else is doing it but in the animals case the reason they perform so well is because it's kind of rigged in fact you could replace the animal with just about anything even a snail and it's going to do well just consider this research conducted in 2013 found that by randomly selecting 30 stocks out of a list of a thousand companies and buying them all in equal proportion you're increasing the likelihood that that portfolio would contain smaller stocks which have more potential for higher growth as proof of this between 1980 and 2015 smaller stocks returned over 11 on average while large stocks only returned 8 so that just means when animal stocks are picked at random while investing an equal amount in each you're more likely to include smaller companies which have a higher return than the overall index and voila he beat the market but now what about michael's situation because after all he bought into the S&P500 where every single company is worth over 5 billion dollars""]"

video is based on a very simple premise hey guys what's going on jeb here and in today's video i am speaking to anyone who has been in the cryptocurrency space for less than 12 months which is the majority of our audience because i've been in crypto for about five years now july 31st 2022 will mark five years since i got into the bitcoin space and over that time i've learned quite a bit about how to handle bull markets bear markets and what we are in right now this may so colorfully coined a turtle market in this video i am going to be detailing the number one piece of advice that i would give myself when i'd only been in cryptocurrency for six months and bitcoin went into the 2018 bear market if you enjoyed today's video make sure to hit that like button and subscribe to the channel for more content just like this but without much further ado let's go ahead and dive right on into it as you well know by now bitcoin has been more or less trading sideways ever since about the 5th of january of this year and we've been losing volatility we can see that down on the three daily chart if we bring up the bollinger bands they've been constricting even on the weekly chart you can see that they are starting to converge on themselves that means that the interest in the space as well as the volume and the volatility are all declining we see that in youtube viewership statistics our viewership is down every single channel on youtube has lower viewership right now as well as google trends you can see over the last 12 months the keywords bitcoin and crypto over on google have lost a substantial amount of their search interest in fact we can see the key search term crypto is sitting at 14 right now compared to 44 in late october that means nearly two-thirds of search activity for the word at crypto has completely evaporated in the last four months but is this something that we should be scared of or should we look at this instead as a golden opportunity to invest in ourselves so that we're able to reap the rewards and harvest the spoils the next time bitcoin goes into a rally well let me tell you a story about when i got into the cryptocurrency space we're going to go all the way back to july 31st of 2017."", ""so you get a ding when the next video is here i know you've got things to do which is why i've left timestamps in the video timeline just for you you can use them to skip around but remember that watching the whole way through will help this video get found so that's all you need to know about me let's unpack my personal crypto trading strategy the backbone of my personal crypto trading strategy is bitcoin this is simply because btc's price has a huge influence over the price of other cryptocurrencies at any given point in time btc's price is doing one of three things going up going down or staying relatively stable or at least as stable as a cryptocurrency can be when btc's price is increasing gradually it typically carries altcoins along with it especially larger altcoins like ethereum and cardano however if btc's price is pumping hard it tends to leave altcoins in the dust this is primarily because btc is seen as a safe investment if btc is pumping people tend to take altcoin profits and move them into btc for a safer trip to the moon when btc's price is going down gradually it tends to pull down the larger altcoins with it though some smaller ones can continue to perform well if bcc's price is crashing hard then obviously everything else goes down with it this is for the same reason as before if the crypto market is crashing btc is a good place to be and this leads to lots of aggressive altcoin sell-offs as thousands of traders cling to the bitcoin life raft naturally this movement of money between altcoins and bitcoin is somewhat cyclical and one of the indicators i use to figure out where we are in this cycle is bitcoin dominance bitcoin dominance is a measure of how much of the total crypto market cap is just btc if bitcoin dominance is going up this means money is moving from altcoins in to btc if bitcoin dominance is going down this means money is moving from btc into altcoins so once i've assessed bitcoin dominance i need to confirm that the market is headed in the direction that i think it is and i use the total cryptocurrency market cap for that confirmation if for example bitcoin dominance is going down but the total market cap is also going down i typically stay away from trading altogether since it suggests we're on the brink of a dip alternatively if bitcoin dominance is going down but the total market cap is going up then this means altcoin season has begun as you can see here bitcoin dominance is pretty damn low"", ""but when he does post a video you know it's time to listen up more often than not the video is a detailed breakdown of the mentality you need to have going into the next phase of the crypto market cycle and what you should expect in terms of price and volatility i strongly recommend watching bob's first video about the four year cycle from january 2019 when you have the time it's incredible how many of the projections made back then continue to play out today as important as it is to have a long-term view we all know there's much more to crypto trading than ta being up to date with the latest crypto updates is crucial and when it comes to crypto news to me there's no better channel than digital asset news although i do go through all the latest crypto news on coin telegraph coindesk and decrypt every day i don't always click with all the headlines i read nor why what's being talked about is so important the daily videos done by rob at digital asset news help add some much needed context to these kinds of headlines and sometimes i even get filled in about a few important updates i missed because of this digital asset news has been extremely helpful for putting together my own weekly crypto news reviews and you can find the latest one up there in the top right in terms of which video you should check out well this would have to be the price predictions video i did with rob and dave back in june on the digital asset news clips channel something tells me you guys missed that one besides complex crypto news the one place where i frequently get lost is d5 now one of my favorite crypto content creators in this category is cinematics which arguably does the best job of explaining how all of cryptocurrency's top d5 protocols work finimatix also has a few videos about how certain layer 2 scaling solutions work including the lightning network which i recently covered myself cinematic's content has honestly saved my arse in the past when i was trying to understand complex defined apps like yearn finance and uni swap v3 i've also used a few of finematic's images in my videos now given that decentralized finance looks like it's going to be the future of finance you would be wise to familiarize yourself with the basics of defy and cinematics has a video that can help you get started now the thing about crypto though is that before you can understand things like decentralized finance it's often necessary to understand how legacy finance works this brings me to my next favorite crypto content creator and that's joe brown at heresy financial though joe is not necessarily a crypto content creator by trade he does frequently talk about where bitcoin fits into the broader financial system and why btc has value in that context if the channel name didn't give it away heresy financial has some pretty hot takes about almost every element of legacy finance joe explains these elements in a way that's easily digestible to someone with zero financial education and the content on his channel is a must watch my favorite flick is titled quote the origin of modern money and its dark future and it's one you absolutely must put on your watch list if you're serious about money and investing now the one topic that heresy financial doesn't tackle is crypto regulation but thankfully there's another incredible channel where you can go for exactly that if you're a fan of xrp or have just been trying to keep up with ripple's case against the sec you've probably heard of legal briefs which is my preferred channel for crypto regulation legal briefs is jeremy hogan is also not crypto focused per se""]"

this specific situation an ascending wedge in case you don't know what an ascending wedge or an ascending triangle i don't care what you call it is it would be price pushing down then pushing up to a resistance level then having a higher low same resistance level higher low same resistance level a lot of times this can signal a breakout to the upside not every time and trading ascending wedges anywhere is not profitable trading is sending wedges on their own with a one-to-one word risk ratio probably wouldn't be profitable so it's a lot about the way you trade these patterns which is what i want to dive into now so ascending wedges are super simple i don't feel like i need to go into more detail on what those are so that's an ascending wedge the next step or the first step actually is looking for a level of structure that is prominent and relevant to this market if we look left on bitcoin you can see that we had some major resistance from the exact area we are in right now in the past on this market so that means we are at a major level we also have this ascending wedge coming through and a lot of traders like to wait for the ascending wedge to break out pull back and then get in right here that's completely fine if you're a more conservative trader on in situations like this i like to be more aggressive which is why you saw me buy earlier so now let's break down the way i trade these patterns because again i'm not just placing a trade going one to one reward risk ratio and hoping that ascending wedges work out the formula for success in any trading strategy is that you either have a higher than one-to-one reward risk ratio with a higher than let's say 40 chance to win or and that's just a generalization or you have above a 50-50 above a 50-50 chance to win and a one-to-one or higher in terms of reward risk ratio so in this case the average trade that i take based on these exact rules that you just learned ends up being about a two and a half to one reward risk ratio i have no idea what this trade will do this is something really important for you to understand especially if you're a beginner or someone that's been struggling for a while in trading i have no clue what this is going to do could bitcoin drop right now and stop me out absolutely could bitcoin go to 10k right now for sure i have no idea could bitcoin reverse and head higher"", ""we have our conditions met of moving average area of value combined with our area of structure we have our entry met with a long Wicked candle followed by buying pressure for a bullish trade we have our stop in place and our Target in place this is where I would actually place the trade if I click play you'll see that price did eventually push up high enough to hit our Target anything I tell you about trading psychology will be completely useless unless you have mastered what I'm about to tell you if you have not mastered the basics of whatever Market you're trading in if you have not mastered either technical analysis or fundamental analysis or both whatever you decide to trade based on and if you have not mastered creating a strategy that's rules based enough for you to stick to and proven to be profitable over time along with mastered risk management then I can speak for hours about trading psychology and it will help you zero because until you've mastered those four things nothing I say about trading psychology is going to help you in any way shape or form so if you are currently at the position where you you don't have a Mastery level understanding of the basics of the market you're trading in or you haven't mastered technical slash fundamental analysis or both and you don't have a strategy that's rules based that you're sticking to and you don't have a risk management plan then you need to work on all of that and then come back to learning about trading psychology feel free to stick around through this lesson but understand that nothing about trading psychology is going to be applicable until you master those other four parts of your training after you have those things mastered trading psychology and discipline can still be a bit difficult and this is where this little hack comes into play so many Traders see themselves as bad or inadequate based on the results of a single trade or a single week you may go out and lose two or three trades in a row and think of yourself as inadequate as a Trader think of yourself as a as a loser in the markets for lack of better terms and think about this whenever you last joined a signal service if you ever have what if they sent you two signals in a row and they were both losing trades have you ever gotten that and been like oh this guy absolutely sucks at trading obviously he doesn't win he just lost two trades in a row if you have don't worry you're not alone when I was starting out that's what I thought too when in reality that person may be a good Trader but they just had two losses in a row they may not be a good Trader I know some signal services are a bit sketchy but the point here is no matter how skilled you become no one will ever know what the Market's going to do at a specific moment no matter how much skill you acquire at trading you're not going to know what price is going to do on one specific trade as I learned from Mark Douglas our ability to be profitable relies on our ability to understand and accept that we are trading based on a statistic advantage that plays out over a large sample size of Trades so although we can't predict exactly what the Market's going to do with a hundred percent accuracy right now we can make a very high likelihood assumption based on a large sample size of Trades and a predictable pattern that is proven to be profitable over time otherwise known as a strategy so to make this very clear as a professional Trader I am not trading based on what I know the Market's going to do next I am trading based on a statistic advantage that plays out over a large number of Trades you will be trading when you are profitable not based on what you know the market will do no matter how skilled you are you will never know what the market will do at that exact moment but what you will be trading based on when you become profitable is a statistic advantage that plays out over a large sample size and for me that sample size is about 100 trades so what I do is I pay attention to my trading based on a sample size of 100 trades I don't look at it going""]"

None of these guys are outright nefarious scammers like the hustle bros you will see pitching an amazon automation course and this automatically makes them a million times better than this other group.

phone right like it doesn't have to be professional photographers lots of people sell presets geared towards hobbyists and instagramers who want to edit their photos on their phone now to sell your presets you can use a marketplace like filter grade that will help streamline the process of marketing and selling the product these services usually take a percentage of your sales so if you're looking to actually keep all of your profit you should instead sell them on your own website or e-commerce shop overall a super cool way to make money with an evergreen digital product so that brings us to the next digital product which is selling social media templates this includes things like instagram story templates content creating media kits or really any template that will help anyone on social media for example you could sell templates for real estate agents that need better advertising for their properties on social media the reason why people buy these social media templates is for two reasons one they don't want to take the time to learn how to use photoshop which is what most people assume is needed even with free and easy to use platforms like canva people don't have the time to spend creating and designing their own posts which is where you come in especially with the growing number of professionals joining social media platforms the demand for these types of templates will continue to go up and up and as you guys know i love selling things that are trending upwards in demand like all other digital products you need to invest time to create the templates upfront"", ""so yeah by no means are they high ticket digital products which is good because it makes it way easier to sell similar to the notion templates you'll find that it becomes lucrative once you start selling packages bundles and add-ons that give people even more value which of course will allow you to charge an even higher price another cool thing about creating pdfs is that you don't actually have to make money off of it right away you can instead offer it for free as a lead magnet when people sign up on your website so that you can grow your email marketing list and make a profit later down the line with other digital products if you want to get started with selling pdfs the easiest ways to design them are through websites like canva google slides and also using programs like keynote once you've finished designing you can export it into a pdf and upload it onto your website your course or a platform like thinkific gumroad or etsy overall it's a really solid way to get into the digital space with very little overhead plus pdfs on average are way easier to make than many of the other digital products we're talking about in this video next is digital art which encompasses any artwork that you sell digitally online you can create logos for youtube channels or brands you can create and sell downloadable patterns or wallpaper that people can purchase and the reason why these are so much better than selling physical art is that you're once again leveraging the power of the internet meaning your art can be shown to pretty much the entire world now there's so many different ways that you can sell your artwork but the one i'm going to focus on in this video is just selling digital arts on a platform like etsy when putting your digital art up for sale there are two main ways that you can list it either as an instant download or made to order an instant download would be an image that immediately becomes available after they purchase it and a made to order is when you have custom digital art that will take time to customize and make before sending it to the purchaser now definitely prefer instant downloads because you have the ability to make fully passive income that has zero product cost but of course if you want to charge more per order you can definitely go down the custom print rep there's so many people out there selling their digital arts and"", ""but after that they can sell over and over with zero product costs to you and you're really saving people a ton of time by supplying them with these types of templates which means you can charge a good amount for them the process is very simple if you use a platform like canva to create all of your templates because you have tons of click and drag elements so you don't need to be a design expert at all there's also programs like photoshop and illustrator that take a long time to master but if you want the easiest program to use i just recommend going with canva focus on making targeted templates for specific people so for example you can make instagram story templates for specific niches like real estate agents loan originators and other entrepreneurs these types of people are the ones joining social media professionally for the first time and they're absolutely going to be looking for these types of templates it makes sense because if they buy a template all they have to do is plug in their own text and pictures to have a social media post in under a minute next up is fonts and i think that this is one that you guys use a lot but don't realize you can actually sell your own font as a product preferences and fonts are constantly changing so if you're someone that can create fonts you're in luck more than 600 000 companies are being made every year and with everyone moving to an online business model there will be a huge demand for new fonts if you guys are into graphic design then this could be a really great way for you to experiment with your artistic creativity while also making a good amount of passive income per month the average price for a font is about 30 let's say you do a hundred sales per month that's going to equate to three thousand dollars which is amazing if you don't care about keeping 100 of sales but want more exposure you can also sell it through an online font reseller like creative market where you keep between 10 to 70 i know selling fonts sounds a little bit out there but you can really make a living off of it depending on how much effort you put in for example jeremy vesey makes six figures per year selling fonts on creative market it's definitely a strenuous process to create a font and it's definitely a skill you need to perfect but like every other product on this list it's a crate once get continuous sales 24 7 type of deal and your buyers can come from anywhere in the world making the market absolutely massive for our next digital product we have spreadsheets these include documents calculator spreadsheets and any template that helps do conversions or calculations billions of people use spreadsheets every day and because of this you can actually make a ton of money selling them some popular templates that have been created are ones to help people with bookkeeping dieting expenses data sets and more the problem is that many of the applications out there like microsoft excel or google sheets can get very advanced which is why you see tons of influencers on tick tock and youtube starting accounts dedicated to teaching others how to use it if you're curious about whether there really is an interest in this market take a look at miss excel or your excel friend on tiktok their videos generate tens and even sometimes hundreds of thousands of views for their excel tutorials which i'll admit are extremely helpful i can also see these types of tutorials being helpful if you're a college student taking an excel class as well as anyone that's just you know looking to make your life easier if you

of course now hold on a minute how does this app know what she's buying and selling if you click the little I at the upper right hand corner you'll be able to see that it tells you that's because of something called the stock act which requires every Congress person to disclose what they're buying and what they're selling within 45 days of doing so now for Nancy Pelosi she discloses on average roughly 14 days after she invests which is why you see that 14 days under average delay but wait there's more and this app also allows you to follow and copy the one the only legendary investor Warren Buffett with the Buffett tracker now his returns are nowhere near as high as some of his esteemed colleagues at only 12 but that's still really impressive because let's see where your returns look like after a 50-year career with her all your Bitcoin anyway if you click the information in the upper right hand corner you'll also be able to see that the reason they know what his Holdings are is because of form 13f which forces the hedge funds to disclose their positions within 45 days of the last day of the calendar quarter now this is also how they're able to get the buried tracker this of course is the famous Michael burry who predicted the global 2008 financial crisis and here you can see his entire portfolio and you can see his yearly averages 50 percent with 60 made last year which to me is just mind-blowing when you consider the fact that the stock market is supposed to return eight to ten percent on average so this guy is doing five times better than the average there's also the Citadel tracker very similar returns at 45 percent last year 49 if you're not sure what Citadel is it is the number one most profitable hedge fund manager of all time with Kenneth Griffin as their

the consumer defensive space and they are trading at just a lick just a little lick above 52 two week laws despite having a pretty solid fundamental picture behind them I often like to find the most damning charts for my top trade ideas because if you can find stocks that the market has almost unanimously given up on and has unanimously decided that they don't want to touch and at the same time the company attached to that ticker if it has an actual business model even if it's not insane but if it has an operating business model well oftentimes that's all you need for a massive massive squeeze or at least the massive massive rally ralita sort of like an underdog Arbitrage situation where the stock is such an underdog that everybody hates it it looks so sketchy to touch no one wants to even look that way and when you have these Underdog trades well what happens is that if there's any sort of semblance of a business well that means there could be an insane Ricochet effect and you've already seen a lot of proof of concept of that during today's market hours and I think you're going to see more and more of these types of runs you go over to dilution tracker as you know I am allergic to two things in this world dilution and also penicillin but the second one's not relevant but dilution tracker says the overall risk is low offering ability is low dilution amount excluding shelf is low historical dilution is low and cash need is low in fact dilution tracker estimates the company has about 54.9 months of cash left so very solid from that standpoint if these numbers are correct now of course it's worth mentioning though that when you're talking about super small cap companies and you're talking about four and ones especially there can be a discrepancy between the reporting the estimates and what actually is going on and that's fine because in that discrepancy there's a lot of opportunity for trading and debate in the market to happen and that's where a lot of the fun comes in because you could trade off those moves if everything was clear and everybody had decided on evaluation of a stock well it would be flat there'd be no opportunities it's where you get into these really really small caps and some of these sketchier areas of the market where people a lot of people don't want to touch that's where you get a lot of those rally rally toe opportunities it's also where you get a lot of risk though right got to keep that in mind but anywho if you're looking at the dilution tracker numbers looks pretty good now this is a company that did their original IPO with JPMorgan City cicc and China Renaissance in mid-2021 that was at a price of 13 and the offering amount was 273 million now in days though even after today's run well the stock is trading at a market cap of just 6.39 million dollars that's a really really far cry right sure things have been bad in the super small cap market and in foreign markets and Asia and all that kind of stuff"", ""but in 2018 the Spy went up 18 and the spxs went down 71 percent now if it were just a potential loss of 3x it actually would have gone down only 54 percent but because of what's called that daily recalculation the final drop actually worked out to 71 down the difference between the 3x expectation and the actual outcome that's that return differential this is why you don't typically hold these these are not meant to be Buy and Hold assets they're meant to be bought and sold relatively quickly that's because of the daily calculation and the effect on the return differential so in addition the XPS and the xpl that's the version for going 3x long they're not free to use there's a very small fee that is taken from the holder the annual fee is actually only less than one percent but you do need to be aware that every single time you buy or sell some portion of your capital is going to that one percent 3x ETFs are absolutely higher risk than stocks but some would argue that their lower risk than options and shorting and they're definitely less complicated for someone to begin to learn before learning options and shorting now if the markets are crashing and you don't have any tool for hedging your long Investments you can only go One Direction and that's down so there's value to these for hedging and for profit taking I typically start all of my trades with these ETFs by buying the stock outright normally if I'm going to trade calls and puts I normally buy those on the Spy I will sometimes buy those on these ETFs as well but the Spy has advantages of implied volatility which could enable me to get a higher price range that's a whole other conversation for another day but it's another level of something that needs to be learned to really Master these traits the reason that you would buy one over the other is largely based on how much money that you have to work with if you wanted to put less money at risk you might buy the call or the put on these ETFs but if you had the money they would make more sense to Simply buy the stock outright and it would make more sense if you're going to do an option to just buy a call or put on the Spy all right quick mention for one of my chat group members he played a lucid put based on the EV video that I made the other days EV winners and losers and he had this experience audience it reads that lucid put I had the other day I couldn't sell it at the 70 percent profit that I made because I was out of day trades so instead I sold it for a hundred and forty percent the next day""]"

basis about risk management about how to stay disciplined to a trading plan also goes over how to build a full trading plan it's a mentor program as well meaning that it comes with what's called priority email anytime you have questions about trading in general or about the course it'll be me personally answering those questions i spend about three hours a day currently answering questions from students and i love it we also send out weekly videos showing you what i'm looking at major levels of structure in the market and how i'm planning to trade around those levels every single monday

however and you can learn about the other factors i look at by clicking that link up there in the top right though not necessarily fundamental another factor i look at before copying a new crypto to trade is its market cap as i've mentioned many times before the market cap of a cryptocurrency is ultimately what determines how high it could go and not its sticker price which can sometimes be deceptively low market cap is an extremely important metric for my crypto trading strategy because it helps me estimate the percentage gains it's likely to see if it goes crazy i'll use our weave again as an example because well just because ar's market cap is currently around 2 billion and assuming btc continues to hold or grow and solana continues to rally i think ar could still 3x from here with that in mind i can set price targets to sell because i bought around the 40 mark i could sell a bit at my 2x mark which is 80 and a bit more at my 3x mark which is 120 depending on how things are looking at that time i could let the rest ride up to a point where i'm happy with the percentage gains i've made obviously if i was doing this with a brand new cryptocurrency i would do my best to get

cryptocurrency trading strategy i know it sounds simple"", ""and we're seeing the investors are getting tons and tons and tons of IMX tokens over the next couple of years and even GameStop who received an IMX Grant they dumped every single token it's just not a very strong uh outlook for the tokenomics for the schedule of the unlocks so like on the website you see token sales public and private are only 19 but the problem with that is is that 19 is a first of all accounting for two billion tokens that's a lot of capital A lot of liquidity that's in that 20 and then second of all it's unlocking every single month here Robbie and the team are doing everything possible to kind of prevent the dumps trying to lock up tokens in the ecosystem and stuff like that but at the end of the day when you redistribute it to investors they can do what they want it's an open market and as mentioned it's a bear Market a lot of people want to secure liquidity in these time periods to be able to then accumulate at their levels of DCA Comfort whatever it is so that's just one example always check out the white list always check out the distributions because the schedule of release is so much more important than like this for example obviously great at 50 is going to ecosystem development but we've also seen the developer grants that can be dumped from that right you have to read between the fine lines always check out the white paper and look at the distribution schedules and how can you find more about distribution schedules without really digging not deep into every single white paper head over to token.unlocks.app and you'll actually be able to see all the upcoming unlocks in the space this is an incredible incredible platform to use to see what unlocks are around the corner

directly to that level we're currently just hovering around this level at one of six point eight two but we will be looking on lower timeframes for possible entry reasons for that trading plan to come together on this dollar yen pair and give us a push up because we are expecting this push up to come in to the 108 area right here at this previous major resistance combining that with these previous major support levels so that's alright traders so this market was hovering somewhere around the 106.8 level last week and as you can see we had a pretty nice rally out of this market we ended up pushing up directly into this previous level of structural resistance that we were talking about becoming possible support so another instance where predicting market moves in this very simple way has paid off pretty well and let's go ahead and talk about what we're expecting in the future here out of this pair well since we have created this double top situation here on the dollar yen we're not really looking for a trade at the moment what we'll wait on is to see if this market get back down into the 106.8 level once more give us a possible long trade or if we see this market ahead higher

we expecting next out of this pair well since this market has just come up high into this resistance looking left"", ""if in a downtrend that very most recent structure support level that was broken it's going to be a very accurate place to predict that the market is going to continue in trend to the downside so that very simple concept applied out here on the daily chart is what is made for some really accurate predictions for us here at the trading channel week after week now whenever you add this most previous level of structure that we just broke which would be right here our resistance level whenever you add that concept to a structured level that has been tested multiple times as you can see this level was used as resistance twice here and as support by our big green candle right here when you combine those two factors that's what has come together to create one of the most accurate ways I've ever found to predict price action moves and when using these two concepts together you're not only predicting price action moves you're also predicting them in in trend continuation as you can see this market was breaking structure levels into new highs and the only way for this concept to work is if the markets breaking structure levels in the new highs or breaking structure levels in the new lows and a downtrend in order for you to wait for that pullback in to that previous level that maybe combines with another previous level of support looking left and give you a possible accurate trading opportunity based around your trading plan so take this concept go out in the market test it for yourself see how many times it works vs. doesn't work apply different things to this you can apply indicators to this to help make it more accurate there's nothing wrong with that and you can apply anything else that already exists in your trading plan to this as well and guys I know this concept sounds simple and for a lot of new traders for some reason they believe that trading has to be extremely complicated but in reality the more simple your rules are for trading the easier it will be for you to follow them and more complicated doesn't always mean more accurate this is extremely simple and I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of the best ways I've found to accurately predict market moves this extremely simple concept of understanding trend and structure levels and guys if you'd like more advanced training on structure levels trend along with the entry reasons and the entire trading plan that we use here at the trading channel then you can learn more about that in the EAP training program which there's a link for in the description but otherwise let's continue the video so now that we've talked about what we're using let's go ahead and apply this to some other markets here we have the dollar"", ""and we've broken above the most previous level of resistance we're actually waiting to see if we can get some kind of loan opportunity for trend continuation up into 1.4 409 a really good place to look for that opportunities if this market pulls back into one point 409 - that's a level that's acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past as you can see little spouts of support and resistance in through here so again a great place to look for trinken you asian for us here at the trading channel is going to be around 1.4 o 9 - out of this power dollar pair and the final pay we're gonna take a look at and predict the market moves for you using this very simple but accurate technique is the Aussie dollar here on the Aussie dollar we predicted a possible shorting situation coming out of this zone right in here the markets still hovering around in this zone so our expectations are still the same we're looking for possible reasons to go short out of this pair from the zero point seven 805 level now if the market starts to push down from this level a good place to look for some possible long opportunities is zero point seven seven one five and if we get a break above this level will look for possible shorting situation around zero point seven eight eight one and that traders is our predictions on the top five major pairs along with a really valuable tool that you can hopefully add into your trading if you're interested in doing so and for those of you who are still struggling to become profitable I personally know how that feels I spent a lot of time studying strategies and techniques that ended up not working at all in the markets""]"

behavior of humans during bad economic times investors and lenders panic consider these quotes drawn from newspapers during previous crises the main excesses of the past few years have scarcely begun to be liquidated said one investment advisor in 1969 we're talking about a possible economic wipeout said tim richardson in 1986 they're selling the good with the bad because they can they're throwing everything out the window said another in 2000 this market sentiment has real world impact when investors and lenders panic they reduce new lending and new investment as they attempt to de-risk their balance sheets in a famous paper ben bernanke labeled this the financial accelerator economic shocks cause investors and lenders to panic and stop new lending and investing firms that rely on external financing reduce their discretionary spending and weaker firms go bankrupt all of which reflexively feeds back into aggregate economic activity we can see this pattern recurring in the historical data default rates and borrowing costs for high yield issuers track a gdp based recession indicator during recessions the high yield spread spikes upward default rates soar this stress rewards companies that are profitable and cash generative while weak firms and companies that are investing heavily in burning cash struggle and often go bankrupt simple logical quantitative factors are significantly more predictive during these times of economic crisis than they are during expansions crises are high stress environments where basic tests of solvency and profitability become seminally important in dictating a company's survival and economic future companies like tesla or we work may thrive during expansions when money is cheap but such excesses do not long survive in times of market turmoil investors who can keep their heads when everyone about them is losing theirs can therefore exploit simple predictable rules to make significantly outsized returns and have the confidence that the probability of achieving these higher returns is much higher in times of crisis than otherwise the only problem is the extreme behavioral difficulty of investing when others are panicking so for each crisis we read through the newspapers the time of the crisis and study the key quotes in that research to help provide insight into just how stressed investors were and the levels of fear one would need to overcome the profit today i will lay out the information you need to make decisions when crisis strikes we first looked at how different asset classes perform when high yield spreads are above and below six and a half percent to get a sense for how they perform during tranquil times in terms of panic small value stocks outperform other asset classes when spreads are below six and a half percent but vastly outperform when spreads are at or above six and a half percent not surprisingly high yield bonds perform in line with investment grade bonds and spreads are low but perform well when spreads are high the us market and investment grade bonds perform roughly in line and before and after and treasuries are the lowest yielding asset class both when high yield spreads are low and high regardless the best performing asset class during these periods historically been small kept value by a country mile what about alternative assets investors might plan to take advantage of the next crisis through private alternatives like private equity and distressed debt in fact many investors have private equity and distressed debt allocations precisely to take advantage of these moments of panic we consider both alternatives private equity unfortunately for investors in private equity private equity firms essentially stop deploying capital when high yield spreads rise above six and a half percent which is also the time when returns in private equity are the best high yield spreads had a negative sixty nine percent correlation with quarterly private equity deal volume from 2006 to

probably sounds totally obvious at first like duh why wouldn't I buy the best but let me explain a little bit about what this means it means company leadership knows what it's doing is trustworthy and crucially has a credible low-risk growth plan for the future it means a business has enormous demand for its products and services and provides the best version of them because if you can't compete by providing the best product your only choice is to compete on price slashing your own profits in an effort to stay relevant not a good place to be but beyond that you want a company in an industry that's poised to grow because even if the company's grand plans for growth don't pan out a rising tide will lift all boats by contrast even the best company in a dying industry will struggle to grow profits you see this playing out with newspapers businesses that build competitor computers are fighting over a part of a pie that shrinks every single year to sum it all up it means buying a company that's set to grow and prosper in ways that you can't even yet predict because it's in a great position number 4 don't play meteorologists I think that being a meteorologist might be one of the roughest jobs out there your job is to predict one thing whether in the future and if you do anything less than perfectly you get blamed by everyone it's easy to fall into that trap when picking stocks you bet everything on one company whose future you think you understand and it's way too easy to lose everything think about what we just talked about in principle number three buy the best with each stock you put money behind you have to guess how honest the management is how they'll respond to problems that don't even exist yet and how the industry will change in the coming years no one can predict the future 100% accurately not meteorologists not me not you you can avoid falling into this trap by having at least ten stocks in your portfolio that way you aren't betting it all in the future of just one company and that's not to say you have to buy them all at once that would cost a lot of money but you need to plan to expand your portfolio over time to at least ten all kinds of studies prove out that portfolio diversification has helped investors lose less money in a market crash and make more when the market soars so take advantage of this principle and make it work for you principle number five commit this is the toughest of all once you buy a stock you've got to commit the day after you buy the company its stock might drop 5% doesn't matter what does matter is if you bought the best the company or even the whole market might lose 50% of its value in the next year doesn't matter if you still believe the company's core business is strong to be honest such a drop might be an opportunity to buy more stock since you're getting a great business at a discount but the key thing here is if you've done your research and are so confident in the company that you're willing to put money behind it you should be so confident that you're willing to hold the stock through its ups and downs for years of course if it turns out management's been lying or the business collapses you shouldn't blindly hold the stock out of stubbornness"", ""yes that's a very same gentleman in 2008 through all the mergers divestiture and spin-offs managers make promises of synergy and new beginnings do you make us make money but little of substance actually change in the products in 2015 the two companies were brought together Berkshire Hathaway 3G and three team at makers and Deere funders as Kraft Heinz and the merger was completed in July 2015 at the time of the deal there was unbridled enthusiasm on the part of investors and market observers and partly unquestioning acceptance that the new company become a force in the global food business was the pedigree of the main investors in the years since the merger though the companies had trouble delivering on expectations of revenue growth and cost-cutting the bottom line is that while much was promised in terms of our own revenue growth room expanding its global footprint and new products and increased margins from cost-cutting at the time of the deal the numbers tell a different story in fact if investors was surprised by the low growth and declining margin the most recent earnings report they should a bit since it has been a long slow bleed the earnings report the earnings report that triggered the stock price collapse for Kraft Heinz was released on February 22nd who can take bad news on many fronts one flatlining operations revenues for 2008 where I'm changed from revenues in 2017 but operating income dip before impairment charges from 6.2 billion in 2017 to 5.8 billion in 2018 the operating margin drop from twenty three point five percent in 2017 to twenty two percent in 2018 two accounting irregularities it is surprised the company also announced that it was under SEC investigation for accounting irregularities in its procurement area and took a charge of 25 million to reflect expected adjustments to its costs three goodwill impairment the company took a charge of fifteen point four billion for impairment of goodwill primarily on the US refrigerated and canadian retail segments an admission that they paid too much for acquisitions in prior years for dividend cuts the company a perennial big dividend pair cut its dividend per share from 350 to 160 to prepare itself what it said we are difficult 2019 while investors were shocked the crumb trail leading up to the report contained key clues revenues had already flattened out in 2017 relative to 2016 and the decline in margins reflected difficulties the 3g faced in trying to cut costs after the deal was made the only people who care about impairment charges a pointless in in the delayed admission on overpayment and acquisitions are those who used book value of equity as a proxy for overall value the dividend cuts were perhaps a surprise but more and what they say about how panic management must be about future operations since the company disattached dividend cuts intercept natural dividends cuts them only as a last resort with the bad news in the earnings report still fresh let's consider the value of X let's consider the implication of the stock and the value of craftiness of all the news in the earnings report the flat revenues in the declining margins as I see them a part of a long-term trend that would be difficult if not impossible to reverse while Kraft Heinz may have a quadrant or two a positive with positive blips I see more of the same going forward in my evaluation of forecasted revenue growth of 1 percent a year in perpetuity less than the inflation rate reflecting the headwinds the company faces the downbeat revenue growth story would be accompanied by a matching bad news story and operating margins where the company will face pricing pressures in its product markets leading to a drop I'll be at a small and gradual one in operating margins over time from 22% in 2018 to 20% over the next five years the company's cost of capital is currently 6 percent reflecting the nature of its products and its use of death but over time the benefits from the ladder will wear thin and since that is close to the average for the industry US food processing companies in an average cost of capital of 6 point 1 2 percent I will leave it unchanged finally the mistakes the past few years believe at least one positive resin in the form of restructuring charges that I assume will provide partial shelter from taxes at least for the next two years the good news is even with a stupid story Kraft Heinz has a value of 30 4.80 that is close to the stock price thirty four point two three the bad news is that the potential upside looks limited as you can see in the results of a simulation that I did allowing expected revenue growth operating margin and cost to capital to be drawn from distributions rather than using point estimates the finding that the value falls within a tight range for the first decile at about 26 and the ninth a close to 47 should not surprise you so the range of the inputs are also not wide as an investor you're at the actions that would follow from this valuation if you own craft x""]"

structures what I'm doing is looking at a daily chart what I'd love to see on daily charts is a market that has a significant break of support because at that point I know exactly what I'm doing I'm waiting on the market to get back up to that previous level of support before this significant break and that's where I'm looking for trading opportunities but not on the daily timeframe unless I get a very specific and an odd situation entry reason then I may enter on the daily chart but most of the time I'm dropping down to the 4-hour chart or the 1-hour chart and looking for really specific entry reasons around these areas of structure so that's a really fantastic situation for me when a market does something like this on a daily chart because I already know exactly what I'm looking for and vice versa just as the second example we were talking about if a market does this and we get a slight break of this previous support level again the power in this is that I already know what I'm looking for as a swing trader I'm trading on a four hour and one hour time frame what I'm gonna be looking for in this situation where we get a very small break of this previous level of structure support is that move back up to this resistance level this then becomes my significant level of structure that gives me a highly accurate place of placing trades and before we move any further let's talk about if you're a day trader maybe you don't swing trade on for hour and one-hour charts but maybe you trade let's say on the 15-minute or the 5-minute chart if that's the case then you would want to do this type of analysis this pre-emptive analysis to spot out these major levels of structure that you can trade around you want to do that on a four hour or one hour chart because that's gonna be a lot more applicable to your trading time frame if your trading time frame again is the fifteen or five-minute then you won't this analysis to happen only four hour or one hour chart so while we're here and again before we go any further on the training section let's actually take a live look at this on the euro dollar so on the euro dollar right here we have a market that's pushing down"", ""so what are we looking at now here on the pound dollar we're actually just waiting on a double bottom at this very specific level of structure that we pointed out earlier in the week based on major support looking out on the daily charts let's check that daily chart once more to show you guys what I'm talking about this level of support you can see has pushed the market up multiple times in the past coming down into that level once more I don't know that it's going to necessarily create a big uptrend like it as these previous two times and I'll show you guys why that's the case why that's my belief as well as you can see the first time we bounced off 127 the market jumped up a significant amount the second time we jumped up a little bit less this time we could quite possibly jump up a little bit less maybe come up to this trendline before pushing down but what I do know is that this level should give some type of balance and we've already got a 50 pit bounce out of this level but what I would really expect from this level is something around 100 pips of a bounce maybe even a bounce up the 128 level at around that 100 pip mark and that's exactly what we're expecting so based on what we're expecting based on that predictive analysis we're gonna be waiting for a double bottom on the lower timeframe there on the pound dollar now another pair that we were taking a look at that has done something interesting is the Aussie dollar on the Aussie dollar we were saying earlier in the week that we wanted to see a close above this previous level of resistance that's exactly what we got we'll go down to a smaller time frame to show you guys what we're waiting on now let's drop down to is let's say a four-hour chart on this four-hour chart the red area we have highlighted here is going to be that very specific zone of structure that likely area for great trading opportunities so we're waiting on the Aussie dollar to get into that area and provide some type of entry reason to go long based on our structure analysis and our trend analysis out on higher time frames the daily chart"", ""yes that's actually what it's called in the absence of any reversal patterns the safest thing is to assume the worst and take some money off the table especially if you're in profit remember that waiting is also a wise decision and if you're feeling brave you can buy the dip and i have a video in the top right that can help you do it once you've identified the long-term price trend the presence of a bullish price pattern on the monthly chart and moving averages on the daily chart along with any reversal or continuation patterns the last step is to confirm everything you're seeing using a series of technical indicators specifically the moving average divergence convergence or macd the relative strength index or rsi and bollinger bands now while trading volume is another important indicator that many swing traders keep in mind it's arguably less reliable when it comes to cryptocurrency in theory trading volume is the easiest way to determine if a pattern or price trend will continue and this is confirmed when there is lots of trading volume supporting a bearish bullish or reversal pattern in practice however the low balance of btc on exchanges means that it takes a lot less capital to push prices up or down and this means it takes less trading volume to move prices around as you can see on btc's weekly price chart trading volume has been on the decline since may while prices have spiked during that time an experienced swing trader would look at this and see a bearish divergence opposing trends between prices and trading volume which suggests that btc is about to crash the thing is that the balance of btc on exchanges has likewise declined substantially since may and this trend continues to this day this means that a decline in trading volume is arguably of little concern when it comes to predicting price so long as the btc on exchanges continues to drop too what's more important is the macd now as some of you will know the macd tells you whether there's about to be a change in the trend this is what it means when those two lines cross starting with btc on the monthly we can see that those two lines are coming close but have not yet crossed this confirms that we have a few more green months ahead switching to the weekly we see a similar story though these lines are coming closer to signaling a reversal now interestingly btc's daily macd shows that we saw at the start a shorter term reversal at the beginning of november something that was foreshadowed by a divergence between the macd and price which started back in october we appear to be approaching another short-term reversal this time to the upside taken together this suggests that btc will drop a bit more before rallying in december and this is in line with macro factors such as the bitcoin options expiries which tend to drag down the price of btc at the end of each month next up is the rsi which gives you a sign of when it might be a good time to sell and a good time to buy as a general rule of thumb an rsi above 70 means it's a good time to sell and an rsi below 30 means it's a good time to buy starting again with btc on the monthly the rsi is showing a slight divergence in relation to price which is a bad sign on the weekly however the rsi looks just fine and suggests it could soon be a good time to buy we can also see a bit of a divergence between price and the rsi on the daily but this seems to be correcting which is a good sign and also suggests that it might be high time to buy taken together this further confirms that btc will drop before continuing its rally though the signals here are more mixed than they were with the macd now be sure to keep these inconsistencies in mind before making any big trades and last but not least we have the bollinger band indicator which gives you the range within which prices are likely to move if prices pop above the bollinger band it's probably a good time to sell if prices drop below the bollinger band it's probably a good time to buy so starting once more with btc on the monthly we can see that the upper bound range for btc in december is around 71k which is almost the same as the conservative price target we determined with that bull flag we identified earlier if btc's price pops above the bollinger band the way it did back in april and may this could take btc up to around 78k which is again in line with the optimistic price target we identified earlier meanwhile the weekly bollinger bands suggest an upper bound price target of 70k and the daily bollinger bands suggest an upper-bound price target of 68k taken together this provides the final confirmation we need to know that we can safely buy btc to swing trade and our projected profit is around 30 percent over the next month or two not bad for btc but swing trading gains are obviously bigger with altcoins when it comes to swing trading altcoins swing trading can be a bit more complicated this is because altcoins tend to be more volatile and their price action can be more easily influenced by other factors that can't always be seen on the charts for example larger altcoins like ethereum solana and cardano will occasionally appear to be printing a bullish or bearish price pattern and suddenly do the complete opposite sometimes what you're seeing when this happens is a low resolution version of bitcoin's price action because altcoins are heavily correlated to btc especially larger ones other times what you're seeing is idiosyncratic to that coin i.e an unexpected announcement that causes the coin or token to dump or pump respectively the price action that follows these unexpected announcements tends to violate every single indicator moving average price pattern and sometimes even the long-term price trend on an altcoin this happens a lot among mid and small cap wall coins which i'll discuss in a moment first though let's look at how to swing trade large cap altcoins using eth as an example the process is more or less the same as with btc begin by assessing the long-term price trend on both the regular and log scale moving on to eth's monthly chart notice how it looks eerily similar to btc now eth also saw a bull flag a couple of months back and is likewise on the cusp of another bull flag breakout a conservative price target is around 5.5 k when measured from the body of the reference candle and an optimistic target is around 6k when measured from the wick of the reference candle eth's daily price chart is where things look a little different although eth also respects the 128-day and 200-day moving averages the 50-day moving average seems to be a lot more important in terms of cutting losses for swing trading this could be due to the shorter time preference you often find among altcoin holders in any case it's wise to play around with different moving averages to see which one your favorite altcoin respects the most not surprisingly the macd and rsi for eth look about the same as btc on the monthly weekly and daily and so do the divergences or lack thereof however the bollinger band suggests that the 5.5 k conservative price target we initially set might not be conservative enough especially since eth has historically respected that upper bound range this could be because many eth traders are likely to roll their eth gains into btc if btc takes off in the way i mentioned earlier and the price charts are simply reflecting that historical tendency remember low resolution now i'll quickly point out that all these indicators do lag behind price and the upper bound range of the bollinger band will change as eth continues to trend up over time even so the rotation between altcoins and btc is well known and something you absolutely must factor in when you swing trade altcoins now you can learn more about the ebb and flow of the crypto market by checking out my video about that and you can find it up there in the top right and now for the moment i'm sure many of you have been waiting for swing trading mid and low cap altcoins i'll use two well-known tokens as examples the first is ren and as you can see it looks like its price is in a long-term uptrend but its price action looks a bit strange compared with other altcoins this is because ren belongs to a cryptocurrency protocol that makes it possible to move cryptocurrencies between different blockchains in a trustless manner now while ren does tend to rise and fall with btc its price action is more directly correlated with the demand for its trustless wrapping protocol since ren must be staked by dark nodes which secure the vaults containing the coins and tokens being sent between chains this means that ren's price can be pretty accurately predicted by following the total value locked on its protocol as such it's better to analyze ren's price from a fundamental lens rather than the technical one and there are a lot of altcoins that require this kind of analysis at the other end of the altcoin spectrum you have tokens like audiences audio which pumps and dumps on a regular basis audio is in a clear uptrend but even from a distance you can see that its price action is characterized by a pump followed by a slow trickle down before another pump this is a pattern you will see with just about every mid and small cap altcoin when they're newer like audio is it's damn near impossible to get a grasp of what's going on in the long term since the data isn't available and this makes swing trading very difficult to make things worse slapping on all the indicators on the daily reveals a mess of mixed messages which makes them pointless if you're lucky looking at shorter time frames can offer an explanation as to what's going on but getting that close to the price action probably isn't going to help you with swing trading because it deals with longer time frames now i don't know who needs to hear it but a bull flag on the hourly doesn't mean that coin or token is going to the moon now this isn't to say that altcoins like audio are bad they're just extremely difficult to swing trade for the time being as more data becomes available it will become clear which way they're headed for now though their long-term potential has yet to be assessed by the crypto

eleven dollar bitcoin what times anyway i feel like that kind of helps put this current bull run in a bit of perspective things just really really are looking very bullish right now bitcoin has actually tripled in market cap since november the amount of buying coming in of course has been massively outstripping any of the big supply spikes we've seen from miners or from wales but of course we're now faced with a tough conundrum is bitcoin about to make history can we seriously get another green monthly candle for april if so it would be the second longest run tied for the longest run of course ever and if we can go on to make a new record of eight green candles in may that would be a record run i of course remain ever the bitcoin bull"", ""Bull Run Easter 2019 Bull Run Easter of 2023 you fill in the blanks but every three to four years Bitcoin recovers from a heavy bear market and Easter has typically been a starting point for a run in the upcoming months or weeks not only Easter but also you have to figure the taxes due around the Sun this time of the year as well so that could contribute maybe people are done paying their taxes maybe they're getting their tax rebates maybe they're putting that into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies you know maybe people are pulling money out of the banks and putting that in Bitcoin all of these factors could add up to an absolutely massive run for Bitcoin right now we are just leaving the accumulation Zone below the 200 EMA once Bitcoin is above the 100 EMA confirmation that the Bull Run is starting so you can see historically when Bitcoin has broken this green line here the 100 EMA has been the beginning of the Bull Run we are right at those levels now should this diamond break to the upside it'll be the beginning of Bull Run territory we are just leaving the very end of accumulation territory so if you want to get Bitcoin at a discount this would likely be the last time and even better news this might not be one of those short little fuse mid-cycle parabolas and then bear market and all that stuff it turns out that back on March 11th Bitcoin plummeted to the midline of this envelope which is these three moving averages right here basically to continue a healthy price action there should be corrections to the middle of the envelope on the way up like we saw here back in 2016 many corrections to the middle of the envelope helped keep for a long healthy Bull Run however as we saw here in 2019 never cross back to that envelope had a nice parabolic formation a very strong price movement"", ""if that starts to happen you start to get a tremendous gap on where the next resistance will be and you're likely to see Bitcoin increase in price of up to the levels of forty seven thousand dollars now what's crazy about that is we could even go to the higher levels of even up to 69 000 after that guys this could literally just spark a full Bull Run that can come at any moment if a bull market starts you are able to make more Bitcoin you're able to make more ethereum you're able to make a lot more dollars so what you always want to do in a bull run is you want to start to spread out your portfolio where you have your safe assets as Bitcoin but now it's time to get into a little bit more risk in your Cardenas your solanas your avaxes you know really good fundamental companies and then you can even go a little bit DJ the reason why you're actually doing that guys because in a bull market they like to run all coins with Bitcoin and the altcoins because they're smaller caps market caps they outgrow Bitcoin by a lot so by you holding an altcoin at that specific time as the outgrowth of Bitcoin you're making a lot more Bitcoin the whole game about being rich in crypto is how much Bitcoin can you accumulate in the bull market so what we want to see over here is if we jump through this trend line it's indicating that we are going on a Bitcoin search now the next thing that's important that I want you to just add to the Chart as well is this very important trend line at the bottom and you're basically taking the low which is around about the 16 000 around about the first of January 2023 and the next point will be around about the 6th of March which was a nice little dip off and what this gives is a trend line now what I like to call this trend line is the bull market trend line very important support Trend and what that's indicating is the momentum that bitcoin's moving in at the moment and as long as we hold this trend line and we hold that very important 200 weekly moving average all of these targets are possible at any moment which means you are ready you are ready at any moments that if the market wakes up and we break this area over here it's time to diversify and it's time to make a lot more Bitcoin the reason why I'm saying we can spark a bull market at any point or we can go into depression if you bring up the Wall Street cheat sheet you will see this very important level that we add and what it's indicating is there might be a depression phase so what the market does is it goes through the slow bleed and all these little companies that came out with all this junk and they're just trying to make money you know they all get filtered out because they run out of money and we start to erase and start to remove all the junk from the market so depression phases are very important and I want to show you the importance of how you can take advantage of the depression stage if that plays out now if we start to go to the bearish scenario what it basically means is now the market is going into a long words downtrend it's going into depression phase and what that will look like it will look like something like this where we literally filter out for a while and if I show you a perfect example of it it would be this area over here with Bitcoin where we previously came off of a bull cycle and then we went into this little rally""]"

all of our favorite cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and ethereum but amidst this exhilarating backdrop of bullish prospects out of China we have a lurking threat from the U.S federal reserve casting a

crypto law actually comes into effect this allows for retail investors to buy crypto in Hong Kong now this is on the back of massive moves from Hong Kong from launching Bitcoin ETFs to forcing Banks to work with cryptocurrency companies and all of this is reportedly happening with very importantly here the approval of Beijing meaning that China's window on the world of Finance window to the West if you will is opening up to crypto in a big way in fact they've stated they want to become a major cryptocurrency Hub again with beijing's approval which is massive this will be the filter through which billions of dollars of Chinese money enters into the cryptocurrency markets and while this is happening we are seeing the Chinese Central Bank keeping that money printer Roland baby they are

firms that do not comply could lose their businesses operators of virtual asset trading platforms who are prepared to comply with the sfc standards are welcome to apply for a license the regulator

section below also sure you like this video subscribe to the channel and turn on post notifications for more videos thanks for watching"", ""but\xa0 there's clearly opposition from many quarters\xa0\xa0 which means that the signing of regulations\xa0 into law may not be a straightforward process\xa0\xa0 however a few days after the select committee\xa0 had made its feelings known a contradictory view\xa0\xa0 was expressed by the international organization of\xa0 Securities commissions iosco a watchdog group made\xa0\xa0 up of regulators from 130 jurisdictions and one\xa0 which I must admit I'm not all that familiar with\xa0\xa0 iosco which includes the UK's Financial conduct\xa0 Authority and the ussec among its members called\xa0\xa0 for the UK to regulate cryptocurrencies quote in\xa0 the same way as traditional assets such as stocks\xa0\xa0 and bonds according to the guardian doing so quote\xa0 includes requiring trading platforms to publicly\xa0\xa0 disclose how they vet crypto assets before\xa0 allowing them to be traded clearly explain how\xa0\xa0 they store and Safeguard clients crypto assets\xa0 and ensure they are separated from the firm's\xa0\xa0 own assets that might be used for proprietary\xa0 trading in short then a lot of compliance would\xa0\xa0 be required from exchanges and other similar\xa0 platforms which makes sense in the wake of the\xa0\xa0 collapse of Celsius Voyager FTX Etc the view\xa0 expressed by the treasury select committee\xa0\xa0 however is that regulating crypto in the same way\xa0 as other assets would create a quote halo effect\xa0\xa0 which could mislead consumers into thinking that\xa0 investing in crypto is safer than it actually is\xa0\xa0 which I think kind of misses the point I would\xa0 argue that anyone investing in crypto is well\xa0\xa0 aware of the risks involved and that treating\xa0 it the same as gambling would merely encourage\xa0\xa0 people to act even more irresponsibly than many\xa0 of them already do that said of course gambling\xa0\xa0 isn't taxed in the UK so if the treasury\xa0 select committee has its way well I'm sure\xa0\xa0 many would be absolutely delighted okay time to\xa0 end this Roundup on a high note by stopping off\xa0\xa0 in Hong Kong as I'm sure you're all aware retail\xa0 trading of cryptocurrencies will become legal in\xa0\xa0 the china-controlled city-state very soon and in\xa0 just a few days time on the 1st of June exchanges\xa0\xa0 there will be able to apply for a license from\xa0 the city's Securities and Futures commission sfc\xa0\xa0 to operate now a few things to be aware of before\xa0 you get too excited first up it looks like only\xa0\xa0 the major cryptos like BTC eth and a few others\xa0 will be accessible to investors in Hong Kong as\xa0\xa0 Bloomberg reported quote individual investors\xa0 can trade larger coins on exchanges licensed by\xa0\xa0 the sfc under Hong Kong's new approach safeguards\xa0 include knowledge tests appropriate risk profiling\xa0\xa0 and reasonable limits on exposure the coins should\xa0 be included in at least two acceptable investable\xa0\xa0 indexes from independent providers one with\xa0 experience in the traditional financial sector\xa0\xa0 now it's unclear which cryptos besides BTC and\xa0 eth meet this criteria but the list is likely to\xa0\xa0 be limited so although retail Traders will be able\xa0 to invest through licensed and heavily regulated\xa0\xa0 exchanges only a handful of larger cryptos will be\xa0 accessible to them and they will likely be heavily\xa0\xa0 vetted by said exchanges in order to satisfy the\xa0 powers that be that they know what they're doing\xa0\xa0 so don't count on a flood of inexperienced newbies\xa0 piling into ship on the 1st of June in other words\xa0\xa0 now of course the really big question here is\xa0 just how much pent-up Chinese money is going to\xa0\xa0 find its way into the crypto market via Hong Kong\xa0 China is notorious for its strict Capital controls\xa0\xa0 and the CCP will not be Keen to see a flight\xa0 from the Yuan to BTC eth and others inflows\xa0\xa0 from the mainland are likely to be restricted and\xa0 closely monitored that said this could well Mark\xa0\xa0 the beginning of a pivot towards crypto by China\xa0 as it looks to capitalize on the US's rejection of\xa0\xa0 the industry as I and many others have been saying\xa0 the next Bull Run could well begin in the East and\xa0\xa0 so we need to watch what happens in Hong Kong over\xa0 the coming weeks and months very closely but let's\xa0\xa0 leave the last word on this to Mr binance himself\xa0 CZ on the 24th of May he tweeted quote CCTV China\xa0\xa0 central television just broadcasted""]"

here again with inform trades comm and today's lesson of the day and our last lesson we continued our course on the logistics of stock trading with a look at the oldest exchange in the United States the New York Stock Exchange in today's lesson I'm going to continue this discussion with a look at the different participants involved in the New York Stock Exchange and how a trade is executed so let's get started the starting place when buying or selling a stock is the brokerage firm before the internet brokers are what is nutwood are known today as full-service brokers which basically means that you get to call and speak to a registered broker in placing your trade with the advent of the internet came electronic trading platforms which allow traders to bypass the human stock broker and place trades with the click of a mouse this obviously lowers transaction costs for the brokerage firms considerably and allows them to provide a reduced cost trading environment which is referred to as discount brokerage before we get into electronic trading however let's first take a look at how trades were executed on the New York Stock Exchange before the internet so we can gain a better understanding of the process a trade goes through to be executed let's say for example that you've been doing some analysis and felt that GE stock was due for a run higher so you decided to buy 100 shares before the internet you would pick up the phone and call your stockbroker and ask him to please buy 100 shares of GE at the current market price of $26.40 a share your broker would then call his firms order department with the order for 100 shares of GE who would then notify the firm's clerk who actually sits on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where GE e stock is traded the order clerk would then give the order to the firm's floor broker who would then approach the specialist who was responsible for conducting the market and GE stock the order would then be given to the specialist who would match who order to buy 100 shares of GE at the current market price with another trader who was looking to sell at least 100 shares of GE at the current market price once the trade is completed the floor broker would then notify the clerk that the trade was executed and give him or her the price the clerk would then notify the firms ordered a or men who would then notify you and your broker that the trade was completed sound complicated enough for you well luckily things have come a long way with the internet and the large majority of trades are now processed on the New York Stock Exchange through an electronic system called super dot for trades under 100,000 shares the super dot system can now be used to route trades directly to the specialist on the floor bypassing the other human components which used to be involved in the trade as you can imagine this system combined with online trading systems which allow traders to enter trades right from their computer has sped up trade execution immensely while lowering transaction costs at the same time while stockbrokers order clerks and floor brokers are also part of the process stock brokers now focus on providing more customized financial advice and the clerks and floor block brokers provide assistance with executing very large order sizes that's our lesson for today and our next lesson we'll look at a market which competes with the New York Stock Exchange as a completely electronic exchange the Nasdaq"", ""hi folks David Waring here again with inform trades calm in today's lesson of the day in our last lesson we began a new module on how to play stock trades with a look at how to set up a demo trading platform with think or swim in today's lesson we're going to continue our course on the logistics of stock trading with a look at how to read stock quotes so let's get started for anyone who missed our lesson on setting up a demo account I recommend pausing this video and clicking the link above this video to register for a free think or swim demo so you can follow along as we go through this lesson for everyone else go ahead and click the icon to launch the thinkorswim platform and enter your username and password once you've logged into the platform you should see the trade page of the platform which will be blank one of the reasons why I've chosen to work with the thinkorswim platform is because you can trade pretty much any market that you would like well this is a positive that allows you access to many advanced features as you become a more experienced trader this also means that there are lots of things on the platform that are not relevant to us at this stage of the game with this in mind I recommend simply focusing on learning the areas that we cover in these lessons and leaving the other parts of the platform to be explored at a later time now that we have this out of the way we can go ahead and pull up our first stock quote stocks are represented by something which is known as a ticker symbol which is an abbreviation normally from one to four letters which represents the name of the company that you wish to trade the first thing that we'll need to know in order to pull up a stock quote is what the ticker symbol is for the stock that we wish to view luckily the thinkorswim platform has the ability to look up a stock ticker symbol built right in to get to the ticker symbol lookup feature click the two blue down arrows beside the symbol window which will bring up a drop-down menu with some tabs where you can click the lookup tab for the purposes of this lesson we're going to look at a quote of Microsoft so go ahead and type in Microsoft and as you're doing that you will see it come up in the drop-down menu where you can double-click to populate the quote window once you have the window populated with the Microsoft stock quote represented by the ticker symbol msft what you're going to see going across the screen from left to right is number one the last column this is the price of the last trade in Microsoft stock next in line is the net change column this is the change in price in Microsoft stock from the opening price to the last trade price the bid column this shows the inside bid price which is the best price at which the public can sell the stock the ass column this shows the inside ask price for the stock which is the best price at which the public can buy the stock the size column here you will see the number of shares of stock that are available at both the bid and the ask price in hundreds the number on the Left represents the size available at the board and the number on the right represents the size available at the ask when I say sighs I mean the number of shares available to be traded the volume column volume is the same thing as the number of shares traded in the stock so what displays here are the number of shares traded in the stock for that day in general the higher the volume for a stock the narrower the spread which is the difference between the bid price and the ask price next in line you'll see the open column this shows the opening price for that day's trading and lastly you'll see the high and low columns these columns show the highest and lowest price for the stock in that day's trading these are the main columns that you'll need to understand at a minimum in trading stocks other features which can be seen on this page by clicking the blue arrow to the far left of the quote window and which will cover the significance of in later lessons or the dividend yield the price to earnings ratio the earnings per share the dividend amount the frequency of the dividend the dividend date the 52-week high and low price for the stock the beta put/call ratio and number of shares outstanding level two quotes which basically show the prices in the market in addition to the inside bid and ask we discussed above can also be seen on this page by clicking the blue arrow in the next row down besides where beside where it says trade grid level two quotes are a more advanced feature that will be covering in later lessons if you would like to watch multiple stocks this can be done from the quote page of the platform which you can bring up at the top of the page by clicking the quote tab once you've done this click on the options button which will bring up a drop-down menu where you can select create new watch list once you've done this you can name your watch list click enter and then click under the symbol column to populate the watch list with the quotes that you wish to follow if you don't know the symbol for a stock you can right-click in the symbol column select symbol lookup and type the name and just as you would have from the trade tab another nice feature of the thinkorswim platform is that trades can be initiated from any of the pages where you have your quote set up so traders will have multiple options on that front that's our lesson for today in our next lesson we'll review position sizing and buying versus selling stock short"", ""hi folks dave waring here again with inform trades dot-com and today's lesson of the day in our last lesson we continued our module on how to play stock trades with a look at position sizing and how to buy and sell stocks in today's lesson I'm going to continue this discussion with a look at the most basic type of order that traders used to enter and exit the market a market order so let's get started today's electronic platforms give traders many options for entering and exiting trades which include the ability to tie automatic trade parameters to your stock trades so that they will be executed only if certain conditions are met the most basic order type that a trader can use to enter and exit the market is what is known as a market order a market order is an order that is sent to be executed at the current market price regardless of what that price is when your order is executed the advantage of using a market order is that you are pretty much guaranteed to be filled on your order regardless of how fast the market is moving the disadvantage is that you do not know where your order will end up being filled until after you receive confirmation from your broker of the fill price it is important for traders to understand that just because they click to buy or sell at a certain rate on their platform this does not mean that they will be executed at that price the difference between the price a trader clicks to buy or sell a stock and the price that they are filled at on their trade is called slippage factors including the volatility or amount of price movement in the market at the time the order is placed the time of day the trader is trading and how active the stock is that they have chosen to trade affect the quality of execution that a trader will receive on their orders in general the more active the overall market is and the greater the amount of volume traded in a stock on average the more liquid a stock is and the better execution or fill a trader can expect now that we understand this let's log into a thinkorswim demo accounts and place our first stock trade using a market order if you've not registered for and downloaded a thinkorswim demo account I encourage you to hit the pause button and click the demo registration link above this video so you can download the platform and follow along as well once you have logged into the platform go to the trade page and type the ticker symbol for Microsoft MSFT under where it says symbol and then + press enter this will populate the trade tab with the quote from Microsoft for this example we are going to say that we feel the that Microsoft is going to trade higher so since we would want to buy in this scenario we're going to click on the ask price once you do this the order entry box will appear at the bottom of the platform which will automatically be populated with the default parameters for stock trades looking across the window from left to right you can see that the window is set to buy 100 shares of Microsoft stock if we wanted to change the quantity you can simply use the up or down arrows on the right-hand side of the quantity column to move in increments of 100 or you can type in the amount that you'd like to trade for this example we're going to trade 100 shares the expiration strike and Link columns are not relevant for this type of trade so you can ignore those under the order column it is currently set to execute a limit order which we are going to learn about in our next lesson since we want to send in order to be executed at the best price available in the market we're going to use the drop-down menu to change that to read market under the rules column it should say day which means that the order will be executed based on the thinkorswim normal market hours execution rules leave this set today for now as we will cover this option in more detail in a later lesson once you have all the parameters of the order window how you want them click on the confirm and send button this will bring up the order confirmation window where you can check all the details of the trade one more time before sending the order once you've confirmed that everything is correct click the send button to execute the trade after doing this the order will show up in the order book at the bottom of the platform as a working order and normally in less than a second the oil will show as filled in the order book you've just executed a by market order for 100 shares of Microsoft stock on your paper trading account and can now monitor the trade either from the trade page monitor page of the platform or account tab that's our lesson for today in our next lesson we learn to place trades at a specific price instead of the best price in the market""]"

Binance is rated one of the best derivative trading exchanges for Bitcoin and altcoins because of its cheap trading fees, vast amount of features and continued reliability throughout every crypto cycle. Binance was launched in July 2017 and it's one of the world's leading cryptocurrency exchanges with a main focus on retail and institutional trading. Currently serving over 30 million users worldwide. Binance has the largest volume traded compared to every other cryptocurrency exchange. This means the price of assets on the platform are even more accurate in comparison to other exchanges with lower trading volume. So what is Futures trading? Futures trading is a contract that trades with an expiration date. Crypto Futures trading is a sort of trading that is similar to Futures trading in traditional markets. It involves using Futures contracts, which are legal agreements to buy or sell an asset as a set price. Although this might seem confusing, one of the key differences is that Futures allow for trading leverage."", ""guys really quickly want to give you a brief rundown of what bitcoin is and why you might consider buying it if you're showing this to somebody at thanksgiving hi happy thanksgiving really quickly let me give you a definition bitcoin is the first digital verifiably scarce asset in human history what does that mean well i'm gonna break it down really simply for you first and foremost let's talk about the word digital bitcoin being digital means that it exists online it means that it is able to take advantage of all of the amazing things that the internet provides for example you're able to send payments with bitcoin all over the world nearly instantaneously with just a little bit of waiting for the transaction to clear you don't have to worry about things like banks giving you permission to send a transaction it gives it a property called permissionless and you get to reap all of those rewards of the internet now the next part digital verifiably what does verifiably mean well verifiably refers to the blockchain of bitcoin what is that it's a complicated topic i'm trying to keep this video short but basically it is something called a consensus algorithm that uh allows you to be sure that bitcoin has not been hacked been it allows you to be sure that your transaction is actually happening and is not being spent twice in something called a double spend attack it being verifiable means that bitcoin is perfectly secure it is unhackable and in fact bitcoin is the first unhackable or next to unhackable network in the entire world you would need literally hundreds of billions of dollars worth of hardware and equipment to be able to hack bitcoin that's just not realistic so it is digital meaning that it's global on the internet verifiable means that you are able to verify the third component the third component which is called scarce bitcoin has something called scarcity bitcoin will only ever have 21 million bitcoin created so far there's about 18.8 maybe about 18.9 bitcoin a million bitcoin that have been created there will only ever be 21 million which means that it is scarce the reason that's so valuable is because your us dollar has already lost a large amount of its value over just the last 18 months during the thing that i'm not allowed to say on youtube"", ""that's number one anymore it might not be Bitcoin but one of the crypto currencies or even crypto currencies as a whole we might have a similar thing where we have right now where we have a hundred different crypto currencies that are all somewhat prevalent but where are you gonna be are you going to be are you going to be the guy that bought here at 7,000 and held on for the last 10 years to me saying that from 10 years from now and you're a freaking millionaire because you bought as much Bitcoin as you could the philosophy is that I want you guys to adopt if you take anything away from this video and this is not financial advice I'm just telling you what I would do and I'm telling you what I would recommend my friends to do so don't sue me what I would say to them is buy Bitcoin or cryptocurrency if you think there's no other cryptocurrency will last a long time buy it and hold on to it and forget about it and if the market turns down or sideways as we're seeing right now what you do with it is you pretend that's a retirement fund and you don't touch it until it goes green there's no reason to ever sell a cryptocurrency crypto currencies are a growing market crypto currencies like the Internet in the 80s could you imagine if you bought Apple stock back in 1980 you'd be a millionaire right now even if you only bought like 1% of the company you would be a millionaire don't let the same mistake happen with Bitcoin accumulate it while it's low dollar cost average into it if you want there's a really good on the Bitcoin dot pub and with a channel name of decentralized TV he talks about he talks about a dollar cost averaging a lot which I'm gonna be doing when I have a more stable income but that's basically where every Friday because Friday is the best time to buy there's been statistical analysis done on this that Bitcoin is traditionally the lowest on Fridays because people sell on Friday if you buy a certain amount every day on Friday no matter what the markets doing then in ten years you're gonna be happy because you can treat that like a retirement fund it's an investment so what I'm gonna start doing and I'm gonna show you guys when I start doing it is that when I start having a more stable income what I'm probably do is I'm pregnant put like $25 in a Bitcoin every single Friday like clockwork and I'm gonna put it in a long-term storage and forget about it and never sell it that's my plan hopefully you guys can come up with a similar plan because I think it'll make you very successful honestly with how fast this markets going down I'll talk about Bitcoin in the short term a little bit I don't care about price action to be honest I could not care less about price action and frankly I'm glad we're seeing this run down here from 12,000 all the way down to 6,000 we've cut we've cut in half in the last week that's crazy that's a good thing I'm tell you why there's a good thing for short-term it's a good thing for short-term because that means that we're probably gonna see a V or W formation where it goes like boop boop boop boop where it goes like a boot boot or we're probably something like that because markets even crypto currencies don't go down that fast without having a correction of some kind it might not be in all-time high correction but we're gonna see some kind of correction soon""]"

163,162,17,162_option_trader_18_share,"['option', 'trader', '18', 'share', 'options', 'cents share', 'strike', 'contract', 'price', 'cents']","[""[Music] hello and welcome this is the first video in a short series that explains covered calls if needed before watching this video you may want to watch the first video in my basic option series titled what is the stock option a covered call as a combination of two positions the first is a long position on a stock or ETF the second is a short position on a call option when one buys a call option they are locking in a preset buy price for an asset when one sells or shorts a call option they are selling their commitment to later sell an asset for a preset sell price therefore placing a covered call means that the trader is buying a stock or ETF and then selling an option contract that locks in the right for the option buyer to buy that stock or ETF from the trader for a preset price let's look at a hypothetical example to explain let's say stock XYZ is currently trading for $10 to share to place a covered call the trader buys a hundred shares of the stock for $10 a share he also sells a call option contract with an $11 strike price that expires in a month he is paid twenty five cents that share upfront for selling the option the trader has bought XYZ for $10 a share he has also sold the right for someone else to buy XYZ from him for $11 to share and he was paid 25 cents a share for that right if the price of XYZ is above eleven dollars a share when the call option he sold expires the traders obligated to sell his shares of XYZ for $11 a share he bought XYZ for $10 a share and he sells it for 11 so he makes $1 a share on the stock plus he was paid 25 cents a share selling the option so his total profit is a dollar 25 a share if the price of XYZ does not rise above 11 dollars a share before the option the traders sold expires the option expires worthless this means that the trader keeps his stock plus he keeps the 25 cents that he was paid upfront for selling the option as profit the next month he sells another option and the process repeats the risk for a covered called trader is that the price of the underlying stock makes a large move downward the premium that the covered called trader collapsed somewhat helps protect the trader against a downward movement of the underlying stock when placing a covered call a trader must choose which stock or ETF to buy and which option to sell on that stock or ETF there is a trade-off between potential profit versus downside risk for each option the trader could sell the trader must consider the cost of the option in other words the amount he would collect upfront the price at which the option is exercised in other words the option strike price the amount of downside protection that the option provides and the break-even point therefore the selection of which stock or ETF to use for covered calls and which call option to sell on that stock or ETF depends on the strategy and goals of the trader in the next video we will look at examples of covered calls I hope that you enjoyed this video thanks for watching you"", ""hello and welcome in this video I show an example of selling a put option to buy stock for this example I will use sov the silver ETF at the time of making this video sov is currently trading at eighteen dollars and sixty two cents per share let's say that a trader wants to buy a thousand shares of sov to hold long term however this trader only wants to buy sov if the price of sov drops to $18 per share which is the price that he feels is a good price to buy and hold at one choice would be for the trader to place a limit order for $18 and leave it open if SLV drops to $18 below the order is executed and the trader buys the thousand shares for $18 a share as he wanted to do another choice would be for the trader to sell ten $18 put options that expire in one month by doing so he is agreeing to buy a thousand shares of sov from the buyer of the options for $18 per share if sov should drop to $18 or below the buyer of the option space it upfront cost to buy the options called a premium in this case the premium is 33 cents a share of $330 total for premium varies from stock to stock depending mostly on the stops volatility now let's compare the two choices trader a places an open limit order to buy a thousand shares of sov for $18 and trade of B sells 10 $18 put options on sov let's say SLV does not drop to $18 a below over the next month trader a sits there with his open $18 limit order and nothing happens however trader B sold 10 $18 put options and was paid $330 to do this because sov does not drop to $18 below the put options expire worthless and unused so trader be simply Kisa $330 for trader a nothing has happened the entire month except that he had to leave 18,000 dollars sitting unused in his account waiting for the price of SLV to drop for Trader be things are a bit different he sold 10 $18 put options and was paid $330 to do it he also has $18,000 sitting in an account as well but he has made $330 worth it which is almost a two percent return in a month on his $18,000 his money is also sitting unused waiting to buy the same stock trader a is waiting to buy however he has made a 2% return in a month on that $18,000 let's say instead that sov drops to 1775 a share the limit order for trader a is executed and he buys a thousand shares of sov for $18 to share the put options for trader B are executed and he is assigned a thousand shares of sov for $18 a share which is a fancy way of saying that he buys a thousand shares of sov for $18 a share from the guy he sold the options to now let's compare it is important to note here that I'm leaving off commissions for simplicity trader a less $18,000 sit in an account then bought the stop for $18,000 with the current price of 1775 per share he is down $250 traitor be sold 10 put options and was paid in this example a total of $330 for this he also bought the stock for $18 a share but he was paid a total of 33 cents a share upfront so his total net cost is 1767 per share he is up 80 dollars while trader a is down 250 remember that both traders wanted to buy and hold the stock for $18 per share and both traders did that if the stock had never gone below 18 dollars a share trader B keeps selling put options each month making money while trader aids money just sits in his account unused let's say that sov drops way down in price both traders were gonna buy SL via $18"", ""but he had locked in the right to sell sov for $18 per share he sells SLV for 18 and he paid a total of 17 dollars and 33 cents per share so he makes 67 cents a share - brokerage commissions the trader paid 33 cents per share to lock in a sell price of $18 per share therefore for the trader to make money the price of sov must be lower than 17 dollars and 67 cents per share in other words sov must drop at least 33 cents per share below the locked-in sell price of $18 to pay for the 33 cents per share cost of the option locking in a sell price of $18 per share for a cost of 33 cents per share means that sov must drop to 1767 per share or below if sov does not drop below 1767 a share the trader loses money if sov stays at or above $18 a share the trader would not choose to use this option to sell the stock at $18 per share since you can get more for selling it at the current price at the time of more than $18 per share therefore the option expires worthless and the trader loses to 33 cents he paid up front if sov drops below $18 per share but not below 1767 per share the trader does use his option he buys sov at the current price of between 1767 and 18 and sells it for 18 making the difference between the two however the amount he makes is less than the 33 cents upfront cost he paid so he loses some money but not the whole 33 cents to share he would lose if sov was at $18 or higher now let's compare shoulding a stock versus buying a put option shorting a stock requires more capital upfront buying the $18 put option only cost a trader $33 upfront if the trader shorts the stock and the stock rises in price his losses are potentially unlimited as the stock can climb to any price but by buying a put option instead his possible losses are capped to a maximum fixed amount of 33 cents per share or $33 total plus commissions even if the trader shorts sov and uses a stop loss to protect his account to a maximum loss the price of SLV could gap overnight or over the weekend causing him to lose more than anticipated the possible losses on buying an SL V put option is cap to a fixed amount if sov does drop in price the potential percent gain is much greater with an option let's say that sov drops is $17 per share the profit on an option trade is a much larger percentage of the required money up front there are two trade offs here the first is that sov must move a certain amount for the option to become profitable so sov could drop in price only a little bit causing the traitor that shorted sov to be profitable but not enough that the put option is profitable the other trade-off is the time factor whereas the trader that bought the put option has a much larger potential gain and a capped maximum loss his contract has a one month time limit in this example the trader chose an $18 put option on sov when the current price of sov was $18 and 62 cents a share this was not his only choice of contracts to buy in the next video we will look at other contract choices to trade or could choose with emphasis on the relationship between the upfront cost of the options also known as a premium the preset sell price that is locked in also known as the options strike price the potential gain the potential loss and where the price of sov has to be in each situation for the trader to be profitable""]"

168,167,17,167_compound interest_compound_interest_earn,"['compound interest', 'compound', 'interest', 'earn', 'earning', 'calculator', 'dividends', 'double money', 'simple', 'bank account']","[""how's it going today guys I hope you're having a fantastic day so in this video here we're going to be talking about compound interest what exactly compound interest is and how you can earn compound interest and if you guys are interested I actually have a whole blog article that goes along with this over on the investing simple blog that's just investing simple dot blog if you're looking to check that out I'm gonna link that article up down in the description below it's going to talk more about earning compound interest and one of the best methods of doing this so when it comes to earning interest or a return on your money there are two types of interest you can earn first of all you have compound interest the one that is most interesting to people no pun intended and then second of all we have simple interest so you either have simple interest or compound interest and with compound interest you're able to earn interest on interest but with simple interest it's just interest on that initial principle or deposit so let me go ahead and give you guys an example of this using numbers that way it makes more sense what I'm talking about here"", ""so how do you earn compound interest there's a couple of different ways you can do it some of them are really good and some of them are pretty lousy first of all one way you can earn compound interest is through your bank account through a savings account through a checking account through a money market account or through a certificate of deposit now is this a good way to earn compound interest absolutely not you're actually not even going to be outpacing inflation when you're earning compound interest through a bank account so I would not recommend doing this with your money don't put your money in the bank and think you're gonna become a millionaire through the interest earned from your checking account and if you guys don't believe me go out there and ask a millionaire how much money they made from their bank account and they're gonna tell you that they invested their money in the stock market or real estate or something else they didn't just put their money in the bank save their money let it sit there and build up a million dollar net worth so the best way to visualize these interest rates is to figure out how long it would take your money to double given that interest rate and you can calculate this very easily by looking at something called the rule of 72 and what that means is if you take the number 72 and divide it by your interest rate from whatever the investment is that's going to tell you how many years it's going to take to double your money at that given interest rate so take the bank account for example the average checking or savings account pays about a 0.05 percent interest rate so take 72 divided by 0.05 and you will find it's gonna take 1440 years to double your money so if you have $10,000 in your checking account it's gonna take you over 1,400 years for that to grow into $20,000 so that is a very lousy investment option moving on how about a money market a money market has a slightly higher interest rate and the average is around a 0.1% well not a 0.1 percent it's going to take you seven hundred twenty years to double your money so that is still a very lousy investment option and that's not an interest rate that most people would be happy with so moving on then how about a CD a certificate of deposit a short-term CD might yield about a 1% interest rate and that means that you will double your money in 72 years so if you invested $10,000 as a 20 year old and interest rates did not change by the time you are 92 years old you would have $20,000 now yes you could have a long-term CD at that point"", ""so that's not really a fair analysis but all I'm getting at is that the bank is not the best place to earn compound interest you can earn compound interest through a bank account or through investments from your bank but this is not the way that most people are doing it now the second way you can earn compound interest is through the stock market and this is the best way to earn compound interest and that is because the stock market on average pays about 8 to 10 percent per year and that is a compounded return so following the rule of 72 here if you take 72 divided by your 8% return that means that you can double your money with the stock market about every 9 years and as a young person you will be able to experience more doubling cycles of your money than somebody who is much older so a 20 year old who starts investing their money is going to experience more doubling cycles than a 50 year old who begins investing their money and that right there is that time value of compound interest we were talking about the more time you allow your money to grow the more doubling cycles you'll experience and the more your money is going to grow over time and then another way that you can earn compound interest through the stock market is through dividend payments by reinvesting those dividends when you're paid dividends from a stock you can either take that dividend in cash or you can reinvest that dividend back into the issuing stock and if you reinvest those dividends back into the issuing stock you're earning dividends on dividends also known as compound interest so that is another way that you can earn compound interest for the stock market is through those dividend payments so on average a dividend stock will pay around a 3% dividend and just with that dividend alone you'll double your money every 24 years by investing those dividends and the great part of this is you can earn compound interest through asset appreciation as well as dividend reinvestment""]"

turnover in the U.S economy jolts for short this is where huge amounts of people quit their jobs thanks to problems like wage stagnation and the face of inflation limited opportunities for advancing their career hostile work environments lack of benefits inflexible work policies and just overall not being satisfied with their job and most of the people that ended up quitting were workers from Industries like Hospitality health care and education in other words industries that provide the greatest impact on society but also are the least appreciated then last year in 2022 we saw the rise of movements like anti-work in fact there's a subreddit community of several million members that share their anti-work ideas also happens to be a treasure Trove of gold and memes that everyone can relate with like your company telling you that you need to work harder like it's survival mode"", ""we're still seeing wages increase to the tune of over three and a half percent every single year on a monthly basis this trend isn't breaking we're still seeing more job openings than we would expect and by some accounts we haven't actually reduced the fact that there are 1.9 job openings per unemployed person and this is all being complicated by take a look at this wages being stickier because of reduced immigration less outsourcing by domestic companies and higher minimum wages these higher minimum wages being so common because the service economy needs so much more help right now and folks like airport staffers need to get paid more to be motivated to show up to work or to take the job in the first place and if you add on top of this inflation risk the risk that we have inertial inflation so risk number one of high inflation being wages continue to expand and continue to grow making the fed aggressive essentially guaranteeing us that we're going to get larger and more aggressive federal reserve hikes on top of that we have the risk of inertial inflation which is the inflation that we get when real estate forces people into renting because mortgages become so expensive which drives up the costs of renting properties which increases the owner's equivalent rents which increase cpi or inflation again so in other words we have this disastrous situation where we've only gone through about 50 percent of the d rating so 50 d rating is not debating although some might debate this is complete but on top of that we have the very aggressive plus aggressive fed plus well being led by led by what sticky wage growth and inertial inflation meaning the fed is unlikely to u-turn anytime soon meaning we're likely to go through the next phase the next phase is the earnings recession the eps recession we're going to talk about how much of a decline we could face and how long it might take to experience it on this particular chart you could see that credit suisse argues that the gray line here or earnings revisions have not yet actually occurred to drive equity performance into the territory here that is usually in recessions we would expect to see equity performance decline to below this line here implying we still have quite a ways to go and in this we'll talk about their research suggesting how far that is and how long that's going to take in fact we're going to start talking about that right now right after i mentioned that today over 30 new lectures are being posted in our courses on building your wealth imagine 30 detailed style of youtube videos providing you more education on how to build your wealth whether it's in real estate sales real estate investing in stocks and psychology of money and building your wealth and trying to think of some different scenarios for building wealth depending on where you are in life or where other people are in life as a teaching example we also have four fundamental analysis streams that were posted just this week where we do some fundamental analysis together folks go to medkevin.com join and take advantage of that coupon code before it expires because the price goes up regularly so folks now the big question how long coupled with how much more so that we can try to understand a potential bottom now credit suisse tells us that the average decline in forward estimates for the last four recessions based on international brokerage estimates has been 22 and the average decline in earnings is 19 going all the way back to world war ii now we believe that the earnings decline could actually be worse though because profit margins at companies are starting at such a higher level today because they've had so much pricing power and so what does that mean in terms of how much credit suisse says we have ahead how much damage we have ahead and how long this will take well they argue that the trough will come four months before the trough in earnings and earnings downgrade cycles tend to last 19 months"", ""folks the layoffs are starting and it's about to get substantially worse the last remaining ground that our economy has to stand on is that low unemployment rate our economy still has more jobs than people but sadly that won't last for long the main reason that we have had such low unemployment in the first place is because over the last two years we printed trillions upon trillions of dollars out of thin air in order to create decades low unemployment we have created decades High inflation if you look at the supply of liquid cash assets in the U.S you had a increase from the 1960s to the Great Recession in 08 It sped up dramatically after that to get us out of that crisis but nothing comes close to what we did during the last two years we printed all of these dollars during a period of time where the economy was barely barely producing any goods or services that allowed for persistent demand throughout the beginning of the pandemic and a massive massive comeback after things reopened which then created a massive massive hiring boom in nearly every sector even sectors that had previously been shut down by the pandemic now in a normal economy if people for whatever reason can't work or aren't allowed to work well that means that they have less money to spend and for years after that until they get more money again and the economy improves they spend less so the lack of Supply is met with a lack of demand and that allows the economy to recover a lot more organically in a normal economy massive supply chain shortages are met with massive demand shortages if people aren't working then they can't afford things on the supply chain anyways obviously there's exceptions""]"

VT or some variation of it but what about in general is it real estate is it stonks is it Bitcoins check out this chart over the last 200 years it shows that the stock market has outpaced everything else but why is it then that people say real estate is the best wealth building tool in the world for the middle class they say that because for every one dollar you invest in real estate you can borrow five against it this is called Leverage it's risky but it can be extremely powerful if it's used right now you don't have to decide between real estate or crypto or anything else you can own all of that stuff but what what's interesting about the stock market is that even though it's supposed to return between eight to ten percent per year on average research shows that the average

millions of dollars you can buy millions of dollars uh over over just a few minutes if you want to personally even just uh yesterday I put a million dollars into Bitcoin and I had no issues with that at all even though Bitcoin experiences volatility it's among the most stable options available to investors in the crypto Market which places it among the best crypto currencies that you can invest in right now in my opinion no note that although Bitcoin operates on a proof of work consensus model it's considered to be the best crypto to invest in because of its sizable market share and the fact that Bitcoin is the king of all crypto Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to ever be created it can never be replicated you can never copy Bitcoin everything else becomes just a cheap version of Bitcoin unless you're trying to solve another problem that Bitcoin is not trying to solve and that takes me to ethereum ethereum is not a competitor to bitcoin ethereum is considered to be the very first smart contract platform and it has the largest market cap among all such layer 1 networks as such it's considered one of the best later one crypto projects to date and personally I have a bunch of ethereum in my wallet one reason is the ethereum virtual machine or the evm a decentralized computer that developers interact with while creating smart contracts because of this compatibility many other cryptocurrencies are based on the code that ethereum uses which allows developers to implement their projects on numerous blockchains even though Bitcoin is the most used currency on this list ethereum has a strong ecosystem and is considered to be the most decentralized later one currency by many which makes ethereum one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now number three on this list is cardano cardano aims to be a competitor to ethereum with a focus on scalability as well as ease of use the platform's scalability is centered around two distinct layers of technology which include Technologies for transferring value and tracking Ledger balances personally I do hold a little bit of cardano and not long ago I was at the Satoshi Round Table the most elite crypto event in the world and I was sitting down chatting with Charles hoskinson who is actually the founder of cardano and he gave me a great update on the progress of cardano and the vision and I will tell

175,174,16,174_rates_interest rates_interest_yield,"['rates', 'interest rates', 'interest', 'yield', 'yielding', 'negatively', 'basis points', 'hedging', 'negative', 'treasury']","[""so i didn't know this when i wrote the paper but since then the fed has slashed rates all the way back down to zero this would result in a substantial narrowing of the interest rate differential between u.s rates and foreign rates assuming that european rates don't go further negative or even start rising at the same speed so this results in a very sharp fall in the forward exchange rate and this scenario could create a much lower yield pickup when the currency hedges are rolled forward resulting in much less demand for these negatively yielding foreign bonds at their already existing low yields and to a certain degree this happened but the european central bank stepped in again to purchase a very large amount of those negatively yielding bonds the other scenario which is almost non-existent in the collective consciousness is that it is possible that the european short rates can rise if there is a sharp rise or change in the philosophy of the ecb now when i wrote this draghi was still the ecb president since then the president has changed and i had expected the policy to be somewhat more hawkish but it turns out that the policy of christine lagarde is actually just as david"", ""but we don't really care for this discussion because we want to focus on the important features the only thing that the listener needs to know now is that if he or she buys a german wound at a negative yield so let's say of 25 basis points then if he hedges the currency risk by selling the euro currency forward to convert the proceeds over the hedge horizon into dollars he is selling the forward exchange rate at a higher price than the spot exchange rate so the difference between the forward exchange and the spot exchange rate can then be considered as an additional yield or carry that's actually coming from the hedge so even though the bond has negative yield the hedge creates a positive carry now in the example that i gave you where the differential is three percent this forward currency hedging generates three percent yield so you take three percent and add it to the negative 25 basis points and voila euro got a negatively yielding 10-year german boon now yielding positive 2.75 for a u.s investor similarly a three-month german boon yielding negative 50 basis points will become a two and a half percent hedging yield in this example and a two-year boon will become as of that writing 2.3 now yields have compressed quite a bit the interest rate differential has compressed quite a bit since then but many of these uh arithmetic calculations still hold in other words you can still turn negatively yielding bonds into positively yielding bonds just through the act of hedging now look at it from the perspective of a euro-based investor the act of hedging the currency risk reduces the yield of a 10-year maturity treasury note to negative 83 basis points so positively yielding bond at that time positive yielding u.s treasury note turns into a negatively yielding treasury note once you hedge it in other words it converts a positive u.s yield to negatively yields for a u.s for a euro-based investor"", ""maybe even more so so this scenario has clearly not worked out as i had anticipated but if rates at some points start to rise for whatever reason because of more issuance increasing deficits or some of the legal ramifications of the court judgment for the judicial court judgment in germany it is possible that short rates in europe could start rising and hence the pickup from the from the yield differential would be substantially narrowed this is not a high probability forecast but just a risk to be very aware of now let us apply the same analysis for a japanese yen based investor and then a euro-based investor for a yen-based investor the same table shows that u.s treasuries are the worst yield of a bunch on a hedge yield basis they're actually very negative so in this case because of financial alchemy or anti-alchemy this time gold u.s treasuries is being converted into dirt but the question then leads once one led to is should we prefer to buy u.s 10-year treasuries as a yield of at this time 2.08 unhedged or italy at that time was 252 on a hedge basis in the first case if we had preferred to buy unhedged u.s treasuries we would be taking currency risk but no credit risk in the second case if we are taking no currency risk but we are taking a whole amount of italian credit risk in a late cycle environment credit risk can be more dangerous than currency risk for a european-based investor france provides no yield and italy provides the only other positive yield because of the hedging the u.s is still again at the bottom of the whole earth curve across globe what is not shown in this chart was that for a u.s based investor but its fact was true the longest duration german boons which at the time of the writing was 32 basis points currently they're actually close to zero percent actually yielded 3.3 percent currently they'll be yielding much less than that and for euro investor the 30-year us bond would only yield negative 35 basis points in other words even as monetary policy was easy investors would be tempted by the yields in the longest most duration sensitive part of the youth curve primarily because the currency hedge carry so finally putting it all together the point is this whenever there is a type of alchemy that turns high into low and low into high secondly it uses a yield curve mismatch third it is exposed to shocks to volatility fourth""]"

Often they're making the opposite mistake. They're actually paying at high double-digit rates credit card debt and that's compounding against you as well.

coupon code jeb jebb to get 20 off at checkout for lux algo if you are interested but there are a few other reasons why i think that the bottom might be in one of them has to do with our moving averages and if we go ahead and take a look here at a couple of very important moving averages especially the 200 daily exponential you can see that bitcoin excuse me cardano has bounced bullish off of this and looks to be moving to the upside now even looking down here on the 12 hourly chart we can see that cardano has put into play a bullish engulfing candlestick formation right here and down here on the macd we have been reversing bullish and are moving to the upside which is a very good signal on top of all of that we can look at the rsi here and see rsi push down to 29 indicating that we became oversold for a time also if we take a look here at our volume we can see that while the volume isn't that high we have had a little bit of a blip in volume and with the rest of the cryptocurrency market trying to put support under it and trying to continue rallying especially ethereum right now there's a very strong likelihood that bitcoin and ethereum and cardano are all going to go into uptrends and the final thing i'll say on this point is that cardano has established a strong zone of support right here around a dollar to a dollar and 50 cents and over the last couple of weeks cardano has been establishing a strong zone of support between a dollar and 80 cents and 2.45 cents i think that similarly to how we saw a couple of big rallies break out of our previous zone of

said value investing is simple but not easy the truth is the vast majority of investors will never be able to become value investors as defined by Ben Graham for the reasons we'll outline in a moment this isn't our critique but rather an exercise in illustrating the many components of a value investing approach and mentality while the list we're going to walk through is by no means exhaustive it captures the central tenets behind what Graham believed contributed to successful value investing number one on the list be an independent critical thinker Graham encouraged investors to think for themselves in mind an intelligent investor wasn't the smartest guy in the room but instead the one that used a fact-based methodology and was able to control his or her own emotions Wall Street Journal columnist Jason schwag who updated and provided commentary for the third edition of the intelligent investor neatly summarizes this he writes quote the components that are needed in the character of an intelligent investor are patient's independent thinking discipline eagerness to learn self-control and self-knowledge end quote by being an independent thinker there's a good chance you won't be influenced by the consensus and you will come to your own conclusion based on the facts the vast majority of investors rely on others to form their opinions the so called market experts are busy giving their daily market predictions Graham preached forming conclusions based on cold hard numbers and believed that following the advice of the forecasters was always a bad idea number two on the list maintain a contrary and mindset Seth Klarman founder the value oriented firm Bob Post group called value investing quote a marriage between a contrarian and a calculator end quote for Graham and most other D value investors the contrary anism comes through and buying value stocks which are often stocks that investors are negative on for one reason or another I mean look at the top stocks driving the market today Google Amazon Facebook Netflix these may be great companies but they are the furthest thing from the type of unloved stocks that would fit the mold of being contrarian as a true contraire you have to have a chance to find opportunities that maybe mispriced where the market has potentially overreacted and become too negative on them"", ""quote Graham understood the future was largely unknowable and then investing in the stock market came with uncertainty and risk he wrote quote the future itself can be approached in two different ways which may be called the way of prediction or projection and the way of protection and quo by staying away from predicting and focusing on protection Graham gravitated towards stocks of companies that were so cheap that even if the future was worse than expected there was limited downside in their price and this plays into our next point which is finding stocks with a margin of safety buying shares of companies that had a margin of safety was a central concept in Graham's investment approach the margin of safety was intended to provide downside protection in the event that the future profits of the company deteriorated because Graham believed the future was highly unpredictable and that earnings of companies were also highly variable he favored stocks of companies that could be bought at or below their net asset value to determine this he would take a firm's current assets and net out all liabilities this formula effectively gives you the price a buyer would pay in the event of a liquidation and assigns no value to long term assets for companies valued at or below this level it was implied that there could be upside as the business improved and also limited downside in the event that the business didn't improve number five on the list you got to be willing to put in the work if you've ever picked up the intelligent investor you know it's a daunting book over 500 pages in small eight type font security analysis Graham's first book was even longer at 725 pages the thoroughness in the books reflect Graham's thinking that to fully educate yourself on the markets and value investing it takes a lot of time a lot of work and a lot of effort Todd combs one of the portfolio managers handpicked by Warren Buffett to manage part of Berkshire Hathaway's public market portfolio one said that his daily work schedule is quote literally just reading about 12 hours a day and quote the bottom-line investing takes a lot of time energy and continuous learning and it's difficult for many of us to have the patience and interest in pursuing what it takes to become knowledgeable on the markets and how to become a true value investor investors need to think more like business owners and that's number six in Berkshire Hathaway's 2013 annual letter to shareholders Warren Buffett wrote about two small real estate investments he had made one an investment in a farm in Iowa and to a building New York Siti both proved to be good investments for Buffett but that really wasn't his main objective in sharing the information with us what he was trying to emphasize is the importance that when you're buying an asset such as a stock or a piece of property you're actually buying into the business and you're entitled to the future cash flows generated by those assets Buffett writes quote stocks provide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas yet to see a quotation for either my farm or my New York real estate investment end"", ""and it simply just been beat up by a lot of short-term speculators as probably I would call them and people that don't have longer term time horizon so ret largely is what value investing is all about as I think Ben Graham put it you're not right because people think you're right you're not you're not right and investment because people agree with you or just agree with you you are right or wrong because your facts and your reasoning either correct or incorrect that's what an investing is all about so the next main question I want to cover is sumzero basically asked provide for a stock tip which you should never do and please don't ever ask me for them because you will you know that I will not answer that question but they basically said what are your three favorite stocks currently as long-term buyers and his answer was al ductless question and then so sumzero rephrased and they said so without specifically saying which your favorites and any stocks in particular what what US any stocks that you think of as long-term compounders or value plays which you think warrant closer examination due to the current situation and the world in other words to any great businesses come to mind which you think long-term investors could buy at a significant discount to intrinsic value which is the core of what we're trying to do here and / bribe bought up to stocks so he bought up one called carriage services and one called Live Nation and he says I've never owned either one carriage services is a funeral services business and the age of what is currently going on in the world there's no chance that their business as under Kline in fact the doom and gloom crowd should have piled into carriage services if they expected millions or more to to die from it's December peak however carriage is down 45 percent of which obviously makes no sense and then we have Live Nation they own Ticketmaster and pre what's currently going on enabled a concert to take place somewhere in the world every 15 minutes those three and a half thousand plus global concerts are now down to zero and they're likely to stay at zero for quite a while from its recent February peak peak Live Nation has been cut in half exactly the same as the business the first business carriage services which is very very stable and even a growing business right now so Live Nation has been cut in half I'm curiously waiting for Live Nation to release its q2 numbers in July the of revenues may approximate zero quite different from the numbers carriage services is likely to report in q2 carriage services will be quite profitable in q2 how much sense to the valuations of these two businesses make today and three months ago you've got one business that's doing perfectly fine probably even better than they were in the past one business that is suffering horrendously and they are both down the same amount compared to where they were a few months ago so great example of highly inefficient pricing in the market and potential places where you can take advantage again they're not stock tips but just a demonstration of how crazy and I guess illogical stocks can be priced just because of wider market forces rather than focusing on the actual underlying business which is what really drives long-term returns in pirai finishes this with I love Live Nation as a business and I believe humans will be back to attending sold out Taylor Swift concerts and close contact with each other in 2021 but even after a 50 percent drop Live Nation is not cheap enough for an excel phobic guy like me I still can't do the math on it on one hand maybe after a few reports of zero revenue quarters I will finally be able to buy it if there's a long term compounder its Live Nation so those are some thoughts those definitely aren't all the questions in this interview but that's a bit of a taste of the way that purbright is currently thinking through some of the things that are going on at the moment and they based basically asked them to finish the interview any final thoughts and Pabrai said this too shall pass humanity dodged this bullet very well and will make sure there are no future pandemics that create the mayhem this one did so interpret that as you wish I for one am pretty much already on board with all the stuff that that purpura has said I think that's over the long term if you're going to own a business for a very very long time 1 or 2 years don't really matter that much in terms of earnings""]"

186,185,15,185_equity_return_value_negative,"['equity', 'return', 'value', 'negative', 'shareholders', 'earnings', 'growth', 'beta', 'russell', 'balance sheet']","['and i want to use a couple of somewhat extreme examples just to kind of go through this math because return on equity can be significantly inflated by share buybacks sherry purchases now the way that share repurchases look on the balance sheet from an accounting perspective is a dollar kind of that goes towards share buybacks goes to an item on the balance sheet called treasury stock ad cost and that is generally a negative value which will actually pull the shareholders equity down and if the business just continues to earn the same amount of money every year and they have lower shareholders equity then that will inflate their return on equity upwards quite significantly if we use apple for example which is a business that does genuinely have high returns on equity they have really turned on the buyback machine a lot in the past five or six years or so', ""and they just like clockwork keep earning 20 returns on equity now uh let's say that you can then purchase into that business for say five times book value that is the price that you have to pay to purchase into that stock now uh there's a couple of things we have to understand there the underlying business uh looking at the equity on the balance sheet relative to the earnings that the business generates the returns are really high they're earning that 20 return on equity but your return as a shareholder is going to be lower than that because you've paid more than the equity on the balance sheet you've paid a premium to book value in this case we paid five times book which really means our sort of earnings yield on the business is only going to be one-fifth of that 20 or about four percent and if that business actually didn't ever grow and they just always paid out all of their earnings to shareholders uh four percent is about the return you can probably expect from that type of investment but interestingly when they reinvest their capital and grow the business the equation changes very very dramatically and warren buffett has actually laid this out in a article that i covered recently on the channel called how inflation swindles the equity investor so i want to just read a very short section from that article explaining how powerful that reinvestment engine can be buffett basically explains that investors and stocks earn their returns in two ways firstly they can get paid dividends each year from the company and secondly the business can retain earnings and grow the underlying equity of the business and the earnings power of the business and if you were to put that in bond invest in terms this is how that equation basically looks he says if during this period a high-grade non-callable long-term bond with a 12 coupon had existed so this is just using a typical american business which tends to have about a 12 return on equity"", ""but there are some issues here now the main way that i think you should be thinking about share buybacks is the time the company buys back in their own shares what they're effectively doing is buying out their business partners and sometimes that is a really attractive proposition and sometimes it's not and it's basically entirely dependent on the price now what we ideally want to see is kind of the warren buffett berkshire hathaway approach where they will only buy back shares if after that transaction the remaining shareholders are more wealthy than they were before that transaction if they're buying in these shares for below their intrinsic value now unfortunately one of the things we often see in many public companies and even some of the largest ones in the world like apple for example is that is not necessarily the approach they have to share buybacks rather they will come out and say this quarter we're going to spend x dollars on share repurchases and they don't even talk about price they just put in these billions and billions of dollars and to buying back shares regardless of price and a lot of that spending on buybacks is often done above intrinsic value and can actually be quite harmful for remaining shareholders okay now the second mistake that buffett talks about here is being wrong simply on the future economics of that business now one of the examples i want to use here is the newspaper industry because this was actually an industry that buffett was for a very long time heavily invested in and for a very long time newspapers made buffett a monstrous amount of money and again he was able to redeploy that into other businesses and kind of continue to compound away um and if we look back at it today even with some of the things that happen to the newspaper businesses later on those still worked out as phenomenal investments overall for buffett and berkshire hathaway now the newspaper business is really interesting um because back in the day it was um very much a monopoly or duopoly type business even though there were a huge number of different newspapers all around the the us and all around the world uh generally a lot of these papers were very localized and the only way that you can get news about what's happening in your local town is you buy your local newspaper and sort of the local newspaper in each town really had a massive competitive advantage over any um you know more national type newspaper or any other competitor that that tried to come in there was only really sort of one or two operators typically in each city or each town""]"

in the government so I don't think we want to we don't want to play footsie with this uh this is close enough uh for for the likes of most of us okay"", ""did you hear that they're saying that right now we are seeing a change that we haven't seen in 100 years these are absolutely crazy times for the future of politics and economics Ray dalio posted a graphic which contextualizes where the US dollar May sit in terms of its life cycle because throughout history we've seen currencies rise to prominence and then fall off we saw this with the power of the Dutch economy then we saw this with the power of Britain and now Ray dalio is alluding to the fact that the U.S economy has peaked and is now seeing a decline and we're seeing a shift of power from the West to the East and this graphic would allude to the fact that while the US is fading off China is starting to rise so that leads to the question why are these nations potentially conspiring against the us and why are they looking at settling transactions in other currencies and why are they looking at creating their own currency instead of just using the US dollar it's mainly because the US economy is extremely unstable rapid inflation in the US has become a significant worry and so have the liquidity issues that are facing the US economy a looming banking crisis in the US is definitely scaring foreign Traders enough so to want to decrease Alliance from America now it's probably not only just the US dollar showing a bit of weakness that is leading to some of these political changes it could also be a strategic move a sort of economic Warfare to go after power because at the end of the day money is power so if you can take away the US dollar dominance you also take away the US's political dominance worldwide but it's hard to argue that the US hasn't done this to themselves look at the amount of federal debt you can see debt has been spiraling out of control Jerome Powell even called to raise the debt ceiling and this is in the midst of crazy inflation so really the only solution over the past couple decades to the US's problems has been mean to print more money and print more money and expand the balance sheet and create more liquidity but that just causes problems as the Divide between the rich and the poor continues to grow rapid inflation significantly starts to hurt the economy and eventually you may see that reflected in unemployment numbers and could cause General instability across the entire nation so we really are at a crossroads right now"", ""and it's not just an america problem although they are without a doubt the worst offender when it comes to all this nope nope nope nope governments all over the world are spending more and making less that combined with runaway inflation means that ray dalio is expecting a mega recession coming for the usa which is then likely to be followed by a period of stagflation in fact bridgewater's cio their chief investment officer is actually forecasting a further 20 to 25 downturn from where we are right now for the equity markets ouch ouch ouch that's what that means but also it means that a truck ton of businesses are going to go out of business from small businesses right up to large businesses and that means that a lot of people are about to be laid off and lose their jobs which means that consumer spending will go down in fact it's going to plummet and people are going to be struggling to pay just the basics their electricity bills their food bills that's going to cause more businesses to shut because no one's be buying anything at this place it's a brutal downward spiral until we hit rock bottom ray dalio compares this to the period uh to be just like the debt crisis that came between 1929 and 1932 and if you know anything about markets at all then you know that that is not a time frame you want to be compared to that's the great freaking depression guys that's a terrifying warning from ray dalio interest rates hit zero percent in 1932 and then the central bank started printing money and printing money and printing money and buying assets in the form of government bonds largely what they've been doing over the past couple of years they just didn't see any other way to stimulate the economy at that point this is the same thing that started happening of course in 2008 during the last financial crisis with quantitative easing money the central banks just printing money and going crazy and central banks all over the world basically have two choices either default and be honest with their people about creating hard times or just print more money man to keep the good time train going history shows they will always choose to print more money if they can to kick the can down the road as long as possible and that makes the inevitable crash even worse when it happens we're seeing very large wealth gaps right now more frequent financial and economic downturns that are more severe every time they happen rising populist governments all over the world huge protests against the energy and inflation and all that stuff people feel lost people fear fearful which is the perfect recipe for government manipulation and control during these times people usually gravitate towards more control more polarization more partisanship this is where ray dalio thinks we are right now rey thinks that the us empire is a fading one and that china for better or worse is rising up to take its place well the usa is currently sitting at the top of the current world order with the global reserve currency of course you have to remember that the only constant in history has been change and this is the changing world order that we're looking at and rey and his hedge fund have invested billions to the tune of their thinking particularly in asian markets putting their money where their mouth is now problematically though every change in the world order throughout history has been unfortunately decided by war in dalio fields of the us currently looking at china as a threat and that war could be closed all the taiwan saber rattling the escalations we're seeing there could be the trigger event to cause a war we can already see china's major ally russia of course coming under pressure with what's happening in europe right now and whilst governments may keep the money printing going for now""]"
