medical school i decided that i'd become an entrepreneur and say no to the conventional life trust me this was super scary because i'd spent the previous 23 years believing the only way to get rich was to become a doctor or a lawyer but luckily i took a leap of faith and within five years i had my first one million dollar year i'm not saying that to brag because if you got to see some of the struggles and major failures i've had on that path it wouldn't seem all that impressive but i want to be transparent with you guys and i actually share my detailed monthly income reports on my instagram page and the reason for that is because i know that it's going to make more people go out and find their plane too by sharing my struggles my wins and my story i know people will relate because there has got to be millions of people in the same exact shoes i was in walking but knowing they want to run or in our case fly so is that it is that the shortcut to becoming insanely rich the answer is sorta and the following section is even more important because you need to understand it otherwise you'll stop halfway while trying to find your plane and the hard truth is that while the plan exists for all of us finding it is actually extremely extremely hard i'll stop speaking figuratively and just say flat out making your first 100 000 is extremely difficult likely much harder than working a normal 9 to 5 job and that is why so many people end up quitting the pursuit the thing with entrepreneurship is that it revolves heavily around a compound growth curve this is what the typical income graph looks like for someone with a good job we have single digit raises most years but overall it's pretty flat over the first few years you'll likely make more money than your peers trying to start their own businesses now let's layer on the income of a pretty typical entrepreneur obviously some major differences at first glance right most entrepreneurs will make very little at the start because the first 100 000 is so incredibly hard you're learning you're trying new things failing doing a lot of work but not getting paid and as a result you'll probably make less money that's exactly what happened to me i did not make good money coming out of college because i did not have a nine-to-five job instead i pursued side hustles and started businesses and i actually lost money on a lot of my ventures but like all challenging things at some point you'll get through that initial trek through mud and cow turds and stumble across a scene much nicer which is basically unlimited income potential on your schedule stick through those initial years and you'll hit that inflection point where your income surpasses that of your friends continues rising and then eventually reaches the moon here's a clip from elon musk on what it was like in his first years as an entrepreneur sleeping in an office and showering at the ymca when my brother and i were starting our first company instead of getting an apartment we just rented us a small office and we slept on the couch and we we showered at the the ymca and uh we're so hot up"", ""but it's been proven enough for the world's largest investment firms to start accumulating tokens and coins as far as the security of the actual tech is concerned i'll break it down it's true that some blockchain networks prioritize speed over security and there are always hackers trying to alter blockchain code to try and make more tokens the good news is that the more prominent blockchain networks have been tested by hackers because they're almost always under attack the more computers a blockchain has validating its transactions the more secure a network is a 51 attack happens when more than 50 percent of the computers in a network are hacked or controlled by a group of miners or validators with bad intentions they can prevent transactions halt payments and reverse transactions allowing coins to be double spent now we've been talking a lot about blocks and chains and other tech stuff so now is a good time to explain just what the heck a blockchain actually is at its core a blockchain is just a fancy spreadsheet in the cryptoverse we call this a ledger the ledgers are cut up into chunks or blocks and these blocks are chained together in one giant file called a blockchain the giant blockchain of spreadsheets gets authenticated and verified so there aren't any double spins or other errors this is called consensus and it's a big part of what makes crypto so special consensus means computers are validating transactions and agreeing that the information is correct the two most common ways of achieving consensus in a blockchain are what's called proof of work and proof of stake bitcoin is a proof of work blockchain where specialized computers compete to solve complex math problems and are rewarded with bitcoin we call this mining the more people competing to solve blocks the more secure the network is new miners are incentivized to join the network as the value of bitcoin increases thereby making a positive feedback loop of network security of stake blockchains like cardano avalanche and polkadot are more scalable because they don't require expensive mining equipment or energy inputs like proof-of-work think of proof-of-stake like depositing coins into the crypto equivalent of a piggy bank users can store their tokens into one big piggy bank with other people and they're called delegators the person who keeps the electronic piggy bank up and running is called a validator the token protocol has rules that randomly select validators to add transactions to the blockchain which earns rewards that are shared by everyone who has stored their tokens in that validator so because major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum have so many computers validating the network or so much hash power it is extremely unlikely that they will suffer an attack they're just too many computers or a bad actor to control networks that suffered 51 percent attacks are mostly dead projects that have fewer nodes to validate transactions we've covered what cryptocurrency is and whether it's a safe place to invest money but what gives cryptocurrency its value well value can either be innate or acquired valuables like artwork gold or any other asset have innate value because they're scarce an acquired value is something like trust in a country's government like for the dollar or the yen but ultimately it doesn't matter why people want something it only matters that enough people want it in the case of crypto limited supply of certain projects coins can make holding the asset more desirable simple supply and demand there's also the key element of what the asset can do that creates value many crypto tokens have utility that gives access to platforms they can give holders the ability to trade and create opportunities for wealth building make decentralized payments and easy peer-to-peer transactions or act as a long-term store value speculators also believe that crypto assets will increase in price over time as their utility becomes more widely used so let's break down some of the different types of cryptos starting with the most valuable bitcoin created in 2009 by anonymous developers satoshi nakamoto bitcoin is the first digital currency designed to be a form of payment that doesn't require a middle man for financial transactions the first bitcoins were mined by home computers but as bitcoin mining became more competitive and mining rewards continued to be halved every four years asic miners became a more profitable way to mine bitcoin there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places smallest unit is called a satoshi after the creator buying small amounts of bitcoin is called stacking sats and can be one of the best ways to dollar cost average into bitcoin ethereum ethereum is a decentralized software platform powered by blockchain has a native cryptocurrency ether or eth that's used to pay for transaction fees making the price rise is ethereum games adoption the ethereum blockchain can be used to create and fund decentralized applications or dapps and other secure digital technology the ethereum blockchain's community ran and home to digital money global payments and applications right now the ethereum blockchain is proof of work and ether is mined the merge to ethereum 2.0 where ethereum will become proof of stake is expected to happen sometime in the summer or fall of 2022 crypto assets other than bitcoin are known as altcoins even ethereum although i would argue that ethan has become enough of a household name that it no longer deserves the label altcoin but all coins capture around 40 of the total crypto market cap as of today there are different types of altcoins with different use cases stable coins are cryptocurrency's bank account assets that are pegged to another asset like the us dollar stable coins are used for storing funds ramping fiat to crypto exchanges and trading crypto assets circles usdc and tethers usdt are examples of secure collateralized stablecoins that are backed by company assets and reserves utility tokens are a way to pay for blockchain functionality this means that ethereum's ether is a utility token along with cardano's ada governance tokens give holders voting rights for example uni is the governance token for the ethereum-based d5 platform uniswap security tokens are digital contracts that represent fractions of a real asset like a company recording ownership or stake meme coins are tokens that get their value from community buys and not fundamentals they're driven by hype and online communities privacy coins or cryptocurrencies that can hide blockchain transactions to create an anonymity"", ""[Music] before we head for all-time highs there is a disclaimer i need to supply financial advice is well and good but if you're looking

best note that i've left timestamps in the video timeline that you can use to get around if you're feeling stretched for time of course i'd appreciate it if you watch the whole way through because it will help this video get even more views forget your fud and fomo let's dive into the dip and all the things you need to know the first step to mastering the dip is understanding what it actually is in cryptocurrency the dip is defined as a sudden and sustained drop in price this is a vague definition because whether or not a cryptocurrency is dipping really depends on its general volatility during a bull run like the one we're in now it is normal for bitcoin's price to go up or down by five percent per day or go up or down by 10 or more on a weekly basis for all coins it's normal for their prices to change by more than 10 per day and they can easily gain or lose more than 20 of their value each week if this is the price action you see this means the crypto market is trading sideways and is in a no trend scenario in other words prices aren't really going up or down now if bitcoin suddenly drops by more than five percent in a day or an altcoin drops by more than 10 in a day this could mean a dip is beginning normally you'll know within a few days whether it is an actual dip or just extra market volatility if it is a dip this can signal one of two things a temporary correction in a bull market or a crash that results in a bear market naturally people who are bullish on cryptocurrency will generally adopt the correction narrative whereas those who are bearish on crypto will insist that it will crash down to zero the easiest way to check this for yourself is to pop open the price chart of the cryptocurrency you're looking at on coin market cap or coin gecko set the time frame to one year and try and spot a long term price trend now if you see that the price has been consistently trending up over the last year this dip is probably a temporary correction if it looks like the price is trending down or has reversed from an uptrend to a downtrend in recent months this dip could be the beginning of a long-term crash as you can see bitcoin's recent dip was nothing more than a temporary correction on a longer term uptrend bitcoin has had around four major corrections so far since the bull run began last spring and all of them have been within the 30 range to put things into context corrections in bitcoin's previous bull runs were usually over 50 the reason why they're not as extreme this time around is probably because institutional investors and experienced retail investors have been buying the dip bitcoin's volatility has also been declining over time as adoption increases and the mass adoption we've seen just over the last few months means it's very unlikely that bitcoin will be crashing anytime soon now you can learn all about that by watching my recent video about coingecko's quarterly crypto report link is hanging up there in the top right so now that you know what the dip is and how to spot it the next step is to figure out what could be causing it this is important to know if you're trying to buy the dip because looking at the price charts alone might not give you enough context to make the right call for example if one of your favorite coins is crashing because it's turned out to be a scam no amount of technical analysis is going to help you buy that dip because it's just going to keep dipping by contrast if ethereum suddenly drops because there's news that miners are going to try and disrupt the network in protest of eip 1559 then clearly this will require a more elaborate buy-the-dip strategy the problem with identifying causes in crypto is that it's very rare that you can definitively point to a single factor usually there are multiple factors causing a dip and each of these often cause overlapping chains of events that can turn into a vicious feedback loop let's use bitcoin's recent dip as an example of what i mean by this as far as i can tell the dip in mid-april was caused by a barrage of bad news for starters on april the 15th turkey announced it would be banning cryptocurrency payments now this probably spooked quite a few new investors who might have gotten the impression from certain news outlets that this is the beginning of some larger movement by governments to ban cryptocurrency since cryptocurrency investors are located around the world not all of them got this news at the same time within about 24 hours all the newbies knew what was up and their panic selling was in full force the sudden drop in price this course resulted in reckless traders using too much leverage getting liquidated on futures exchanges in plain english the btc these traders used as collateral to borrow from exchanges to execute these risky trades was automatically sold onto the open market this is what caused that huge wick you see on the bottom of the big red candle on the bitcoin chart for april the 17th in this case the wick was created by all the traders who had set buy orders for btc in that price range these orders were filled by all the btc being sold from over-leveraged traders prices stabilized for a couple of days and then dropped again when the news came out that the current u.s administration was looking to increase corporate and capital gains taxes an increased corporate tax would mean less profit and less profit translates to lower stock prices for all the affected companies an increased capital gains tax would mean that any wealthy investors who have already cashed out some of their gains this year will probably need to sell more assets to pay for the taxes on those gains the combined effect of both factors led to a dip in both the stock market and the cryptocurrency market where it again triggered liquidations from over-leveraged traders though to a lesser degree now i have to stress that this is a simplified explanation of the causes and chains of events behind the recent dip and there were probably way more moving parts at play in the background now if you want to get a closer look at why bitcoin pumps and dumps you can watch my video about that by using the link in the top right now that you know what the dip is how to spot it and all the factors that cause it the next step is to understand how this relates to altcoin dips as many of you already know all coins are highly correlated to bitcoin now this is important to remember during dips because no amount of bullish news can save your altcoin if bitcoin is in free fall sometimes there are exceptions to this rule but i have yet to see a single altcoin that has sustained its price across multiple bitcoin dips not even stable coins more importantly remember that whenever bitcoin dips altcoins will usually dip harder this is because in the context of cryptocurrency bitcoin is seen as the safe haven and altcoins are seen as risky investments you can track how money is moving between bitcoin and altcoins using the bitcoin dominance chart as you can see bitcoin dominance spiked during the recent dip however as with price you can see that the longer term trend is towards lower bitcoin dominance aka more money moving into altcoins this means that whenever bitcoin dips and decimates all coins the profits you'll get from buying the dip will be even larger for all coins this is because they will rebound much more aggressively than bitcoin once it finishes dipping and btc dominance returns to its downtrend case in point during the relief rally last weekend bitcoin went up by about seven percent whereas many altcoins went up by 15 or more pro tip don't be discouraged if your altcoin doesn't pump right away after the market is done dipping if you can see that your altcoin has been in a visible uptrend on the one year time frame it's probably a matter of time before that pump comes your way you can get a sense of when that pump might happen and how high it could take your favorite alt by using technical analysis now technical analysis is much easier to do than you think and this cryptochamp happens to have a beginner's guide in my introvid 2 ta now that you know what the dip is how to spot it and all the factors that cause it and how it impacts the altcoin market the last step is to measure how low the dip could go again a lot of this will depend on the factors that are causing the dip and there is no way of knowing for sure where the bottom of the dip actually is however there are no shortage of tools you can use to estimate how deep a dip could get and all of these can be found on the trading terminals of your favorite cryptocurrency exchanges if the entire crypto market is dipping then your main area of focus should be the btc usd chart even if you don't hold any btc this is because of that bitcoin altcoin relationship i mentioned moments ago start by going full screen removing all the indicators and setting the time frame to weekly this will give you some perspective about what could happen in the market in the medium term the first thing to look for is any price zones that could serve as support if the price were to fall any further in this case it's quite clear that the 49k range is a strong zone of price support for btc next enable the ema indicator this stands for exponential moving average and it helps identify any other zones that could serve as support that aren't immediately apparent in this case the ema suggests that if btc were to drop again the next zone of support would be around 42k this means that if you wanted to buy that dip you'd be trying to buy somewhere around that 42k range remember that the price could drop slightly below this level because of things like liquidations if this dip were to happen it would correspond to a 20 drop you can measure this using the ruler icon in the trading view tab of the trading terminal on the binance exchange full tutorial to use this exchange is in the top right by the way because altcoin losses can be almost twice as big as bitcoin losses during a dip this would translate to a 30 to 40 percent dip for your altcoin holdings so now that you know what the bearish scenario is in the medium term you can get a better sense of what to expect in the short term by using the daily time frame the daily time frame typically offers the best vantage point for buying the dip as with the weekly time frame the first thing to look for is visible signs of support the way to spot these zones of support is by looking at where prices have clustered in the past and this is often much easier to do on the daily time frame as you can see here the 49k range is showing itself as a strong zone of support and the next level below that seems to be around 46 to 47

training then we just had a few graduates out of the EAP training program our flagship program here at the trading channel I'll post some of their testimonials on the screen and that is incredible news for them and that's also incredible news for you because that means that we finally have some spots available in the EAP training program and while you glanced through some of the comments on the screen I want to tell you that if you're struggling to profit right now then I've been where you are too I struggled for over a year before I found a way to be consistently profitable I made every mistake you can think of I've moved stops I used poor risk management I've traded strategies that didn't work I followed a signal service that ended up with me almost blowing my entire account but after that first year and after nearly blowing an entire account I found the real path to trading success and consistently profitable trading became as easy as counting to 6 and that is what I teach in the EAP training program I created a strategy that only uses six simple rules to create an edge over the market so once you memorize these rules trading becomes as easy as counting to 6 these rules are completely objective and easy to follow and although just having a strategy is only one part of the equation it is a very large part of that equation in the EAP training program we also have lessons on risk management and discipline to make sure that you have everything you need to get on the right track to becoming a consistently profitable trader and here's a look at some of the things that are included in the course as you can see we have beginner lessons that teach you everything you need to know about technical analysis in terms of what you're gonna learn in the course we have a transition course which is meant to take you from where you are to becoming consistently profitable and after that we have an advanced course that is meant to take your trading to that next level we also send out three to five email alerts every week these are not meant as signals let me clarify that but instead made to show you exactly how I am looking at the market and we also do a review video at the end of every couple of weeks to show you how the strata these are performing and you can check those out right here so if more advanced training is something that you are looking for then we do have a few spots available in the EAP training program this program also comes with priority email meaning you can email me at any point that you have questions and I will answer you ASAP so if a trading mentor is something you are looking for then look no further go and click the link in the description for the EAP training program and it would be a pleasure to have you aboard and to have you join us in the EAP training program if not that's totally fine too make sure you're subscribed here on YouTube make sure to click that like button for me if you enjoyed this video follow us on instagram at the trading channel and i will see you in the next video"", ""but we can give ourselves the best likelihood of making money by trading something that's made money in historic data so if you have that cst set up then after you have that csd you should be able to go through historic data on a chart and do something called back test throughout this back test what you want to do is look at at least the previous 100 times that the exact rules you have made up through the process of cest happened on a single currency pair and time frame so every currency pair and time frame you would like to test test it 100 times on that pair and on that time frame for instance if i had cest a full strategy made up with cest on the euro dollar and i wanted to see if it was profitable on the daily 4 hour 1 hour and 15 minute chart i would test that exact strategy 100 times on the daily euro dollar on the four hour euro dollar 100 times on the one hour euro dollar 100 times and on the 15 minute euro dollar 100 times so it's always going to be at least for me and my personal confidence level i need to see 100 instances of that strategy playing out that rules-based objective strategy playing out and giving me a profit before i can add that pair to my portfolio because what the reason we're doing this is because with any given strategy it's going to work better on some pairs than others because different currency pairs have different personalities so the reason we do all this back testing not only does it build up confidence and help us with discipline not only does it give us an idea of what may be a good risk management plan for a strategy like this because we can tell out of historic data how many losses in a row did it have how many how much of a maximum drawdown did it have not even just losses in a row how many wins it have in a row you just gather so much information so you get confidence you get a ton of information it's almost like if you're starting a business then you're going to do product research before you start mass producing a product any big business has done this the product research part is then testing that product on a small sample size for us we're testing our strategy on a 100 time sample size to do our product research in order to see if it's something that may work in the future and that's what we're doing while we're back testing so as long as we have that done then the strategy portion of this is over you if you are currently feeling like you have a strategy problem then that is how you fix it if you're currently having a strategy problem where you are confused when you try to place a trade where you are constantly switching strategies any of the things that we listed that were going to be strategy problems if you feel like your problem is with a strategy then create a strategy or learn one that has solid and easy to follow conditions entries stops and targets then take that rules-based strategy write every one of those rules down write down all of your conditions all your entry reasons whether you have one or multiple write down your stop placement and your target payment placement based on all that information go through historic data 100 times per pair in time frame you want to test that on pick out the best pairs that worked and then your strategy problem will be completely solved you'll be good to go in terms of strategy now what was the next problem the next the second thing that if a trader has it it's impossible for them to be profitable it's impossible for them to make money as a trader the second thing is risk management now you hear a number floating around all the time that never risk more than two percent per trade but the thing is that's not correct or incorrect i'm not saying it's wrong i'm not saying it's right because it can't be either of those things considering that risk management is such a personal decision my risk tolerance for instance i may be a super risk averse person meaning that i don't like risk that much and risking two percent of my total account value every time i place a trade may be terrible for me emotionally in psychology psychologically almost skipped over that word uh it may be terrible for my emotions to risk a full two percent per trade"", ""we're in consolidation that is condition number one we're at either previous resistance or support after knowing we're in consolidation in this case we're at previous resistance my third condition was i see selling pressure from a candlestick pattern and my entry itself was the next candle that begins starts as a red candle and starts pushing down then i entered the trade this is what we call our entry the rest of our trading plan our strategy comes down to our stops and targets which also needs to be rules based for me that is stops above the consolidation level targets at the previous level of support for this short trade i'm not going to dive super deep into strategies but we need it to be rules based so we can take and test it see if out of the last 100 times this happened did it produce profit did it produce money over that long period of time remember earlier in the video our whole purpose here is not to estimate and exactly know with our crystal ball what one trade will do no one can do that no one but what we can do is measure out a large sample size and trade something that over that large sample size will make money over time this for example exact system that i traded i have tested through hundreds and hundreds of trades in historic data way way long time ago i've since then traded this strategy hundreds and hundreds of times and throughout all of that testing and trading it wins about 55 it's actually a little less it's like 53.9 3.9 of the time i have it all in a spreadsheet so it's about 54 accurate and consistently gives close to a two to reward to one risk so a two to one reward to risk ratio with these numbers over a large sample size or over a long period of time i consistently make money using this system that's what you need to have and the reason you need all these rules in place is so you can test it and make sure it's made money in the past that's how you get the confidence to not exit the trade right here when the market pushes up like we talked about earlier you don't want to be exiting your trade because you're getting all emotional the way you take emotions out is by statistics and logic and you find those out with a rules-based strategy that you have tested through historic data and saw that it performs well over large sample sizes and produces a profit over those large sample sizes the third way that we reduce emotions is by reducing risk if you are a beginner right now or someone who's struggling in your trading there is a very high chance that you are risking too much especially if you feel emotional when you're placing trades if you feel emotional when you're placing trades then it's because of one of these reasons and you admit it to yourself right now and if it helps put in the comment section below if you are currently struggling or brand new in trading and you're not making money do you have a plan every time you place a trade have you back tested that plan to prove that it's made money at least out of the last hundred times it's happened or if you don't like back testing forward test it demo trade it for six months no rush demo trade for six months using your plan that you've made to see if that produces profit over those six months and number three are you risking too much if you lose a trade does it make you really really emotional because you lost that trade so step number three in this process of solving one of the biggest mistakes that struggling traders and beginner traders make is to make sure that you are not risking too much per trade and there's no real answer to that other than your own risk tolerance for me it's between one and two percent of my total account balance per trade that's what i like to risk and that's what keeps me from getting hyper-emotional because at this point if i lose the trade and lose two percent of my account balance i'm okay with that that doesn't bother me at all so i'm now okay losing the trade i have a plan that i know has made money in the past it takes all the emotions away and allows me to get into and stay in trades that can produce a really really nice profit so if that was awesome""]"

Dogecoin 7 cents polygon 92 cents and Solana 20.46 and the top all coins today based on artificial intelligence would be OVR a cash Network render okb and bitsy coin and you can check out tokenbach's for free link down in the description now Bitcoin has broken back above this green line the 100-day moving average also around the 27 000 resistance support levels has broken back above there sitting right above there at the moment the top of this downtrend right now is at 27.6 can we break outside of this downtrend and hold it interesting question now it appears like everyone just got faked out once again based on the 200ma of the 12 hour candles on the downtrend we had fake outs to the upside and it looks like on the uptrend we have fake apps to the downside once again Bitcoin right now repeating what we saw in 2014 to 2017 we're here to break down we had some resistance a few times and broke between there and once we broke above finding support taking off well same exact thing where we broke down resistance a few times now we are in between pretty much where we were in this area could be a nice setup for Bitcoin but it appears like that area where Bitcoin is sitting is it Wick off accumulation mode Bitcoin has completed the macro Wick off accumulation the whole accumulation lasted for one year now phase after accumulation would be markup phase that's right after whales get all the Bitcoin they can at cheap prices well the price goes up and they start selling that Bitcoin it turns out that while a lot of people are saying crypto is over we do have a bullish Divergence right here on the price and if we take a look on a macro scale where we are markup correction accumulation and then markup phase this is what we saw uh previously with the total market cap where once we broke this downtrend and found support on there took off for a new markup phase well look at where we are right now broke above the downtrend finding support there could potentially be the next markup phase it turns out that based on the November 28th Cycles Theory uh it remains perfectly on track and still calls for thirty four and a half thousand dollars by November of this year the next Blue year will establish time around the price before advancing to new all-time highs so tell me why are you still worried we are still on track for Price going up slowly at first and then after the halfing much more quickly as a matter of fact it's likely that crypto and NASDAQ are likely to follow the Nikki McKay into high levels new all-time highs well for crypto that would be a large increase to go back up to new all-time Highs but you can see all of these have broken through previous downtrends and at least the Nick hey and NASDAQ have had pretty good gains crypto is still pretty sideways since breaking outside of there now for ethereum and all coins we haven't seen anything yet the biggest alt season since 2016-2017 is ahead of us in case you haven't noticed eth copy is a structure from 2015 to 27 17 in front of your eyes patience"", ""so those are important levels to keep an eye out for for Bitcoin but as we speak Bitcoin is basically fighting for price between about twenty thousand dollars and twenty three two night right now though across the markets we're seeing levels of panic that have only been seen five other times since 1994 30 years has only seen this type of panic five other times and guess what every other time it was basically when the markets were at a low before a massive rally and soon you know what could cause that rally well the one thing that's been crashing the markets dxy going up all of a sudden breaking down to unheard of levels breaking down below covid-19 resistance levels support levels also breaking down below this macro uptrend line this could cause USD to drop significantly and just take a look at this chart what happens when usdt drops bitcoin price goes up so those are very very important things to consider now as for the moment the coin values days destroyed has been support for Bitcoin defended for two months straight the first proper test across from covid-19 in the 2019 lows also seen at the 2015 lows this could suggest that the bottom has been in solid accumulation for months at 16 000 as a matter of fact we're seeing the super Trend Buy Signal on the five day flashing a Buy Signal for the first time in over a year the last time this happened bitcoin price went up 239 percent that's like 2.4 x from where the price is just flashed a Buy Signal as a matter of fact if we take a look at this looking at the RSI cups when we had breakouts from these cups this basically began a new cycle for Bitcoin we had the teal and then the blue and then the purple and then the red and now we're on to the orange cup which could lead Bitcoin to some pretty spectacular territory as we have at a breakout from that RSI just recently but you know what happens before the big Bitcoin event the halfing that everybody talks about the Litecoin having it turns out Bitcoin Litecoin approaching the halfing in previous Cycles Litecoin led the Market's new uptrend this is due to Litecoin have things occurring less than one year before the Bitcoin having usually spells the end of the bear Market let's see what happens July 2023 by this summer Litecoin hacking will happen you can see Litecoin price takes up first then Bitcoin follows Litecoin first Bitcoin follows we see Litecoin ticking up first potentially Bitcoin soon to follow we have had a characteristic breakout with each previous Bitcoin Bull Run each time Bitcoin had a green candle which broke through the 81.6 FIB each time this occurred this was pretty much the definitive move before massive rallies that ensued for Bitcoin we just had this green candle break through the 81.6 FIB which was at twenty thousand three hundred dollars almost the same we could potentially see the same exact thing happening for Bitcoin if that doesn't convince you how about on a monthly time frame I love longer time frame charts because you can't fake them out they give you a lot more information than the short little daily or four hour charts but this Bitcoin monthly green candles and RSA oscillator trigger bull run the fourth time in history each time we've had a green candle here in the RSI oscillator which we can see when this basically flips down here well that has begun the beginning of each major Bull Run for Bitcoin we're having it happen right now this is the first monthly candle this is like getting in at the ground floor""]"

I'm willing to take on one property with such a large amount of money from their fifth you should never buy real estate with money that you need short term the one report from Forbes found that it takes an average of five to seven years just to break even on a property purchase once you account for the cost of buying owning and selling and if that sounds absurd just consider this if you buy a home for three hundred thousand dollars most likely you'll pay an addition additional six thousand dollars in closing costs insurance and fees from there you're also going to be responsible for all the miss the business expenses that come with owning a home like property taxes insurance premiums repairs random things that you'd never think about that just comes up out of nowhere which let's just say averages to three thousand dollars a year that means to break even on the property after five years you'd have to sell that property for three hundred and forty thousand dollars or a thirteen percent increase just to be left with three hundred and nineteen thousand dollars after all of your closing costs which is enough to compensate you just for the cost of buying selling and owning a property to begin with now yes of course real estate does tend to Trend upwards over time but that's not guaranteed so if you're looking for a quick way to make cash most likely this is not going to work in your favor that's why I always recommend to only buy a property that you intend on keeping for the next seven to ten years that way your chances of breaking even are significantly higher and maybe you'll even turn a profit and six the same thing could also be said about buying a property without having enough cash saved up from my experience purchasing eight properties over the last 12 years it is so important that you have enough money saved up for all all planned Renovations plus 25 because you know it's going over budget and have enough to pay for all property expenses for at least three to six months otherwise I promise you're going to be running into a situation where you have a two thousand dollar repair you'll have to put it on a credit card and you'll be scrambling to pay it down as fast as possible to avoid the high interest rates or a tenant moves out and it's four thousand dollars to fix the walls once it's empty for another few months while you try to find another tenant who pays less than expected because National rents are dropping I know it sounds excessive or fear-mongery but trust me it happens all the time and it's something to be prepared for however one of the easiest ways to soften the blow is just to plan for it ahead of time and assume it's gonna happen what I personally do is just keep a checking account for every single property that I have and no matter what I always keep four to six months worth of expenses in there at all times for anything that comes up once the amount exceeds that level I'll transfer it over to invested elsewhere it's that easy it's really simple that way anytime there's a repair there's money sitting on the sidelines that's accounted for for that exact purpose I keep it simple and it doesn't need to be complicated and finally for all of you Real Estate Investors out there do not pick a bad tenant or the first person who offers you the most amount of money I'll give you two personal stories that I've had to deal with my first was all the way back in 2012 where I picked the first 10 in new calls at the time I was desperate for money I had sunk everything I had into Renovations I had nothing left to fall back on so I just accepted it within six months he stopped paying he trashed the place and I had to go through with an eviction by the time I actually got him out it cost me about four months of lost rent eight thousand dollars in Damages and another few thousand dollars in eviction fees that was more than an entire Year's worth of profit just lost because I happened to pick a very bad tenant I've also witnessed other tenants who I like to call Professional tenants who simply put up the bare minimum to move in and then they stopped paying and they know that it's going to take them anywhere between 3 to 12 months to actually get evicted so they just Bank the money instead the point being from all of this is that you have to be very very picky because essentially what you're doing is entering into a business contract with a complete stranger for the next one to two years and you need to make sure that you both have clear expectations and can communicate with each other in terms of what each of you expect now overall though since then for the last 10 years I've been really fortunate to have amazing tenants and they credit that to picking the person not the price I typically do not take the highest offer I just want somebody who stays there long term is really nice to work with pays on time and treats the place as it's their own that's all that's why I'm never in a rush it's always better to find the right person than get the highest price I'm doing all of this I truly believe you're going to be in a much stronger position to buy or invest in real estate throughout these next few years even if the market continues to decline my personal philosophy is that there's always good deals out there even if they take longer to find and by investing aggressively for the long term you're going to put yourself in the best position possible to make as much money as possible"", ""and it's usually a combination of both in fact even though you might think that this only applies to investors homeowners do this all the time when they blindly walk into a property being completely unprepared for things to break the moment they close or even worse they didn't realize that they could have just rented the home for a fraction of the price and then waited to find a better deal on something else so from my 15 years of experience in real estate having sold over 130 million dollars worth of homes and I was working full-time as an agent I will tell you with 100 certainty expect that every repair you do is probably going to go over budget so when you're planning a renovation and you're trying to do the calculations to determine the end value just assume you're going to spend 25 percent more than you plan to I don't need to see the numbers I don't need to know how reliable your contractor is it just happens every time in addition to that it's also incredibly common for new home buyers to magically forget about all the minor day-to-day annoyances that begin to add up over time like insurance payments Landscaping utilities that run more than expected property tax increases and regular maintenance that you would never think about until you own a home all of this can easily add up to an extra few hundred dollars a month that nobody thinks or talks about until they've already owned the home for longer than a year that's why it's so incredibly important that you know how to evaluate a property understand how much it's going to cost to renovate add in a margin of error include miscellaneous expenses and realistically know how much the property is going to rent for otherwise it could be stuck with a property that costs too much to own with zero profit and without the potential rental income to cover your costs if needed a third another common mistake out there is to make sure that you do not take on too much debt now don't get the wrong idea because this can't be okay if you're safely making enough to cover the cost of the payments or you get a low enough interest rate but the problem arises where you take on too much debt to the point where you become entirely reliant on rental income a strong housing market or a strong job market to continue sustaining those payments without anything else to fall back on the fact is unless you have the income and the savings to carry through that Mortgage in the event of a loss of income or a job loss you could go broke really really quick just look at what happened in 2008 when people took out too large of a loan and couldn't write out the drop in prices in a way that's beginning to happen again now for those who have not already logged in their interest rates as prices Begin to Fall across the country the last thing you'd want to happen is that you can't make your payments you can't rent out the property at a high enough price to offset your costs and you can't sell because you owe more than what it's worth that's why I typically recommend coming in with a 20 to 25 percent down payment for anything that you purchase so that way you have a bit of a buffer to fall back on just in case fourth speaking of loans I would personally stay away from short-term or adjustable rate mortgages unless you really understand what you're doing the problem I see today is that it's cheaper to take the short-term adjustable rate mortgage than it is to take the 30-year fixed especially with the mindset that the FED is going to U-turn in lower interest rates in Q4 of 2024 because they'll have to do however this is not guaranteed"", ""but that's not the case with commercial real estate instead you'll usually have a 20 to 25 year amortization schedule where a portion of your monthly payment goes towards the loan but there might be a balloon payment due at year seven which means if values decline you might owe more on the building than what the building is actually worth and third as you you probably noticed interest rates have gone up substantially in the last year which means there is a mountain of real estate that's about to be reset at current interest rates and that in turn could lead to an outright property disaster for example CPC reports that 25 percent of all office building loans are coming due in the next year and with rates now five times higher than they were a year ago ownership costs are going to be going up substantially and if you thought that was the end of it it's really just the very beginning now I understand that this might be a little bit too detailed but stick with me because you're about to learn a lot if you're not already familiar with how this works commercial real estate is valued on three main factors one is the land and future development potential of a project two is the price per square foot that it would cost to recreate the exact same building today and three which is the most important is how much money that building is able to make for instance if you pay a million dollars for a building that makes a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a ten percent return if it makes fifty thousand dollars a year that's a five percent return and so on because of that when it comes to these types of Investments Property Owners will always try to maximize the rent because its value is almost entirely dictated by item three the yield and the more money a property makes the more it's worth but today those properties are declining from a lack of rent and they're facing some stiff competition in the form of treasuries see at the core investors are all about the numbers they just think to themselves how could I make the most amount of money for the least amount of risk and work well when interest rates were at record lows and property was earning four and a half percent real estate was looking pretty good because it was actually paying something that was better than nothing but now treasuries are paying about five percent even the most basic of savings accounts are paying four and a half percent most mortgages are above seven percent and that's making real estate look a lot less appealing because why would you buy a negative cash flowing property at five percent when you could get that risk-free guaranteed with a treasury with no work whatsoever this suggests that in order for Real Estate to remain competitive it has to offer a return that's higher than that that you could already get risk-free which is a really fancy way of saying that real estate returns have to go up combine that with the fact that some buildings are now seeing a lower rent at the same time that interest rates are about to be reset higher while office space season 18.2 percent vacancy rate and you've got The Perfect Storm for a commercial real estate crisis so is this something to worry about well let's start with Wall Street because according to Fortune they're running away from the housing market and a prime example would be Blackstone they operate a real estate investment trust where investors could pull their money together to buy a wide variety of assets from residential housing to Industrial office space to Data Centers to hospitality the benefit is that this fund could operate someone like a Reit except by limiting their exposure to high net worth individuals they don't have to be publicly traded and up until recently this fund did exceptionally well but like I was alluding to earlier there's a bit of a problem since funds like these are primarily invested in highly liquid Real Estate Investors are somewhat limited if they want to get their money back after all if your money is all tied up in real estate you can't just snap your fingers and give it back to investors when they want it so as a condition to the service they limit investor withdrawals if too many people want to get their money out at the same time and wouldn't you know it Blackstone is limited investor withdrawals for the sixth straight month in a row why you might ask well imagine it kind of like you bought a million dollar house with a thousand other people if five of those people want their money back that's not a problem because you probably have that sitting in reserves but if 400 people all want their money back at the same time you can't do it without selling the house so either place a restriction on who could take their money out or you have to wait until the house is eventually sold in this case though Barons reported that investors requested four and a half billion dollars from the fund at the exact same time this is also shared by Wall Street sentiment towards housing as well for instance Invitation Homes which is the largest owner of single family renters has scaled back their purchasing because they believe that no longer makes Financial sense especially when they expect the market to continue falling like office space in San Francisco which could see an 80 crash although before we go into the consequences for everyday investors we should first cover realtor.com's latest housing report because there is a lot of new information here that will have a direct impact in you and your wallet in terms of what's happening today they found that there are 48 more active listings available on the market than there were a year ago and even though that sounds like a lot it's still just a fraction of what was available prior to the pandemic on top of that they also found that no region saw an improvement in sellers listing homes for sale in April which means across the entire country there's less interest in people listing their home for sale probably because they don't want to give up their existing mortgage rate it's also quite interesting that the typical home spent 49 days on the market this April which is 17 days longer than the same time last year however homes still spent 12 fewer days on the market this April than they did in the average April from 2017 to 19 and this is precisely why the housing market is not seeing a huge crash like so many people predicted now in terms of which location saw the biggest price increases and drops research from Black Knight found that Columbus Ohio Hartford Connecticut and Worchester Massachusetts saw the largest increases well the sharpest one-month declines could be found in markets like Austin Texas and Provo Utah beyond that though if we look at this from the peak the largest price declines so far have included areas like Austin San Jose San Francisco Seattle Phoenix Las Vegas Boise Stockton Sacramento and Salt Lake City so in terms of what this means for you and what you could potentially do about this to make money here are my thoughts first of all when it comes to funds like Blackstone unfortunately this is just the risk when it comes to all things real estate frankly if you want to buy property it should almost always be viewed as a 5 to 10 year hold at the very least because selling could often take a lot of time and profit is not guaranteed depending on the timing of the market even if you buy a property yourself selling a property often entails weeks to months of listing waiting for a buyer paying a commission at closing and that's something that has to be considered before you actually go and make the purchase separate from that I also think that if Blackstone is facing these issues it's probably a sign that wealthier people expect real estate to either deliver subpar returns or prices will begin to come back down and that's probably why they want to take their money out and be able to redeploy it elsewhere where maybe there's more potential the good news is that not all real estate's at risk and there are quite a few types of buildings that are actually doing quite well like Bloomberg reported that vacancy rates for warehouse and Industrial spaces low retail vacancy is only 5.7 percent and hotels are garnering record Revenue in addition to that about three-fourths of commercial real estate debt generates enough income to pass bank's research or financing standards without any major changes and delinquency rates are still below what they were prior to the pandemic no office space though on the other hand could be the exception because JP Morgan warns that 21 of office loans are destined to go bad with lender is losing an average of 41 percent of the loan principle on the failures because of that banks are expected to scale back on their lending be way more cautious about who they extend money to and that's likely going to affect you or anyone else who wants to borrow some of the bank's money that's why I think if you're looking to invest in real estate right now take your time be aggressive with offers and think long term about whether or not a property really makes sense to buy now I personally believe that long-term real estate still can be a great opportunity but short term banks will make it a lot more difficult to get a loan and that's something worth considering unless of course you have a low credit score just

4,3,328,3_inflation_fed_rates_recession,"['inflation', 'fed', 'rates', 'recession', 'rate', 'economy', 'interest rates', 'federal', 'unemployment', 'interest']","[""but you'd have to force consumers to starve to bring down the demand on the food supply chain thus the FED at best has a very very indirect impact on food prices the FED has to go and nuke three or four other areas of the economy for food prices to go down at all one of the best ways to bring down the price of food is to bring down the price of energy and the best way to bring down the price of energy is to Nuke the entire manufacturing sector which depends on energy and bids up the price is to Nuke overall economic activity which is transported using energy and hope and pray that those pricing decreases trickle over to the food segment as we know energy commodity prices set the price for fertilizers and of course set the price for transportation of food which then gets baked into the final retail price that you pay at the grocery store the other issue driving inflation right now is the presence of heightening labor costs because of the still tight job market many employers are raising pay to attract and hold more workers holding workers for longer even if they don't need them because they're worried that if they fire them and demand picks up to three months from now they won't be able to hire anybody with the same qualifications back and job openings in September Rose alongside wages and economists are expecting October's report to show another Advance forward in wages which is not a good sign from a labor cost standpoint and suggests a lot more sticky inflation the U.S employment cost index is rising at a five percent annual clip and obviously we all want workers to do better and better and become more and more productive and make more and more money but from the fed's perspective this is a massive massive fail if they don't see employees getting destroyed they're not going to believe inflation is over and they're going to continue trying to destroy them with Rising borrowing costs pretty soon borrowing costs are going to be so high that if you take out a dollar you're gonna have to pay a hundred bucks in yearly interest and Biden's going to be like come on man the economy strong as hell fact of the matter is folks that if labor costs are going up that means that this inflation battle is prolonged folks the FED has two simple mandates to promote price stability to promote maximum employ appointment and a third unofficial one is to promote and induce widespread hemorrhoids in the American population which of course is just an inevitable result of the financial constipation that the FED causes quite frankly the lower this unemployment is the more Firepower that the FED has to unleash in order to promote its price stability goal and it's also true that at the same time keep in mind that this unemployment rate that they look at is very very misleading in and of itself if somebody looks at this they might be fooled into believing that all the jobs here are equal in quality in reality this rate does not it does not discriminate between full-time and part-time jobs or temporary or long-term jobs or if employers have a job that matches their skill set and full earning capacity if you have a surgeon working at a minimum wage job well if they can't find a job as a surgeon this unemployment rate does not take that into consideration even if every single person in this economy was working a sub-optimal job and was very unproductive at it the unemployment rate would still be virtually around but that doesn't actually say anything about the health of the economy you have to look at a lot of different factors not just this one static rate which is very much curved in favor of the government and policy makers which is a huge problem because when policy makers at the FED use this to gauge their decisions on how much they're going to raise rates or how healthy the economy is well all of a sudden the data that they're relying on isn't even real another thing which the unemployment rate is famous for is that it doesn't include everyone who doesn't have a job which means that the real unemployment rate is much higher just if you included the people that don't have a job you'd think"", ""[Music] smash the like button all right in all seriousness so far we've established that looking at consumer spending is one of the most important things when trying to figure out if we're going to be in a recession if consumer spending is strong that alone is generally speaking enough to keep the economy from slipping into a recession if consumers are spending money we can avoid a recession if consumers stop spending money then a recession is almost inevitable but the thing about consumer spending is that it's dictated by two very important things access to debt and incomes now anyone has access to debt but technically because interest rates are still really high between five and five point two five percent access to cheap debt is not actually here so that decreases consumer spending the second thing are of course incomes now according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics the real income is measured against inflation is up 0.1 percent ever so slightly month to month but the real real income is down half a percent when compared to from April last year to April this year now when incomes go down people become more budget conscious in February 2023 survey four out of five consumers said they were tightening budgets by buying Less in bulk or shopping around more often for better deals these sorts of micro decisions have a huge influence on the pace of economic growth I'm feeling it when it comes to food which is so weird for me because I've never really concerned myself with how much food costs and when people start to feel the price of basic necessities like food go up interesting things start to happen with their savings check this out this graph shows American Consumer savings now the red line represents the trend of where savings are but the Blue Line represents their actual savings and you can see that at the height of the pandemic savings went up to a peak of roughly 33 percent thanks to all the stimulus but after Q4 of 2021 savings started to go down below the red trend line and in Q2 of 2022 the savings rate reached the lowest point and all of that happened to perfectly coincide with inflation that's exactly when it reached its peak of nine percent in June of 2022 but now that inflation is coming down we can see that the savings rate is slowly starting to come back up but there's a huge catch that's a huge catch the card and fan you know how hard this is I'm an idiot I'm sorry the huge catch is that the data is actually showing people of higher disposable incomes but people with lower disposable incomes are being affected the most and that's why they're tapping into the Forbidden Shadow realm of credit card debt the economists believe that people with less money may turn to credit to cover expenses in this economy I think it's really scary how much people are using credit to be able to afford what they need to have every day that sentiment shows up in this data set from the Bank of America Institute and you can see from this data that people making fifty thousand dollars or less are utilizing the most amount in credit card debt and this is really important to look at because it helps us better understand how this consumer spending is being funded and that will help us better understand how bad the recession could get for the average consumer because are people spending money they already have from their savings accounts or are they borrowing money to do it during the pandemic for example people didn't need to borrow money because they were getting help from the government with all this stimulus but now that the stimulus is gone data shows people started to borrow more but that trend is starting to reverse at the end of 2022 the average household had nearly ten thousand dollars in credit card debt analysts believe that Nationwide credit card debt May soon reach one trillion dollars an all-time high putting everyday expenses on credit is so very dangerous because we know that as interest rates have been rising so have rates on credit cards so is the interest that you're paying on that money that you are indeed borrowing to pay for everyday expenses that's right and now is arguably the worst time to borrow on credit to buyer Essentials especially if you carry a balance when interest rates have reached an all-time high of 20 credit card interest rates have never been higher topping 20 Nationwide in February these interest rates move up and down depending on the central bank's federal funds rate and these rates are generally only charged to customers who carry a monthly balance by the way that part of cnbc's video is sort of inaccurate so side tangent here it's kind of important remember the Federal Reserve does not set credit card interest rates based on the federal funds rate it kind of does"", ""so thank you guys so much and now with that said let's begin alright so before we talk about the best upcoming opportunities you first need to understand what you're going to be up against and to start we need to talk about a recession generally recessions are accompanied by a significant rise in unemployment a drop in wages a loss in consumer confidence and a decline in values across everything from stocks food energy and services with sometimes long lasting effects throughout the entire world but second along with the recession usually comes a decline in earnings see every quarter companies report the revenue and give guidance on their future outlook but lately they've been cutting forecasts bracing for slow or even negative growth inciting recession risks at the highest Pace in 10 years that leads us to third layoffs when consumers earn less they spend less and when companies see less demand they begin to scale back on their expenses with usually employees being the first to get let go in fact just a quick Google search for Mass layoffs shows you dozens upon dozens of companies who are are all trimming their Workforce and as Bank of America explains the U.S economy will soon start losing 175 000 jobs per month so in terms of what this means for you and your Investments as well as how you could use this information to make you money let's start here with number one stocks as of now all three major indexes are down between 20 and 30 percent with analysts like JP Morgan who believe that we have another 20 to go from current levels however if we take a look throughout history since 1946 the average bear Market drop was close to 30 percent with the most severe having been in 2009 when the S&P500 fell 57 from the peak now once you combine the average with the recession bear markets tend to do even worse with an average drop of 34.8 percent which just for reference right now we're down about 25 all of that is to say that generally the absolute bottom occurs when we see capitulation across investors usually that's a time of the start of the recovery and things begin to bounce back now I'll cover exactly how much you can make from this in the next few minutes but first we we have to talk about number two real estate even though every area is different and some locations might continue to flourish housing declines on a national level are actually incredibly rare in fact as you can see throughout the last 60 years there have only ever been a few times where prices meaningfully fell more than 10 percent but now the general Wall Street consensus is that National housing prices are going to decline seven percent with a worst case decline of 10 to 15 percent should interest rates continue to increase of course every Market is going to be different and according to Moody's Analytics the most vulnerable markets could see upwards of a 25 decline from the peak including parts of Florida Arizona Idaho and Southern California with the decline lasting another 12 to 18 months before bottoming out now in the big picture it's probably not going to make that big of a difference for anybody with a fixed rate mortgage who intends to stay in their property for another five to ten years but for anyone looking to invest or buy a house we may begin to see some deals starting to come on the market which we'll cover shortly because we have to also talk about third cash clearly up until now there's been this mindset that cash is wasting away to inflation but when every other asset is falling in price sometimes cash could be the safest place to store your wealth and you know that's significant when someone like the billionaire Ray dalio admits that cash is no longer trash the truth is many people forget that as recent as 2018 cash was the best performing asset and had you just been saving your money in a high-yield savings account you would have far outpaced the market cash is now becoming such a significant part of the portfolio that even fund managers are holding on to the highest amount of cash since 2001 and Citigroup said that cash is the only asset that investors could use as a recession hatch but as far as what you could do about this to make money and why so many people never take advantage of what's about to come here's what you need to know all right so in terms of why this next recession could be a once in a generation opportunity just to consider this first everything becomes less expensive the way I see it even though one person might think this is a bad time to invest everything is falling 30 percent a wealthy person would see this as an opportunity to be able to buy those exact same companies for a 30 discount Warren Buffett really had the perfect analogy for this he said when hamburger prices go down in price we sing when hamburgers go up in price we weep for most people it's the same thing with everything in life that they're buying except for stocks when stocks go down and you can get more for your money people don't like them anymore so first reframe your belief because a falling Market could work to your advantage the second there's less competition the fact is when times are difficult companies scale back they fold they can serve cash and they play it safe but this opens the door for smaller more aggressive companies to stand out and take their place for example one study across 16 000 companies found that those who continue to advertise increase their value and got more bang for the buck with Positive Growth years after the recession ended the third there's way more opportunity in a way a recession is the Market's method of weeding out the week and Patrick met David made a fantastic comparison a few months ago that the peak of the market cycle is exactly like a forest this means that only the largest most established trees or companies get access to all the resources or in this case sunlight everything at the bottom has a difficult time being able to compete and it's hard to grow but just like natural forest fires our economy has a way of repeatedly clearing out and bankrupting the companies who no longer are able to sustain themselves giving opportunities for newer smaller businesses to continue to develop and fourth after every bear Market comes a bull market as Yahoo finance points out historically the S&P500 has fallen an average of 29 around a recession with a median drop of 24 but once stocks have found their low their average return the following year is 40 percent and within two years the market has increased an average of 58 percent this means that investing in the way down is much more profitable than pulling out of the market and waiting and long term the market is always recovered in every single example so far throughout history and finally fifth you have to act before anyone else knows about it""]"

resistance here these candles right here so with that being the case right in this area if we can get a move up and then I move back down into this little bazan we just drew near 1.7 4-4-2 if we get a pullback into that zone it's going to be a great place for us to start looking for Tran continuation opportunities here on the euro New Zealand now a cool part of this we're on the daily chart now delete our drawings again we're gonna drop down to a smaller time frame this is our whole technical analysis approach given to you guys so here we are and what if on this time frame probably not gonna happen here let's go ahead and go down to another time frame what if only one hour time frame here we go so something we can throw in here we're doing technical analysis we can use indicators structure and trend we've already talked about trend and structure we're definitely in an uptrend here only you're in New Zealand as of recently because we just broke out of that period of consolidation on the daily chart and four hour and one our charts are both in uptrend now also we know that this is our most previous level of structural resistance that's been broken makes it a highly likely place to find some kind of support out of this market now what if we start throwing in indicators what if we wait to see if this market gets down to our around one point force probably one point seven for one point seven four five sorry about that guys and up to this black line in that zone what if we wait for the market to get down into that area and when it does get into this area this market becomes oversold and then we find an entry reason based on an oversold over bolt strategy do you guys see the power of doing all this technical analysis before you place a trade based on a strategy you've tested if you've tested oversold markets and then some type of entry reason based on a candlestick pattern or something else in an oversold market and it's proven to be profitable over time doing this technical analysis ahead of time can significantly increase your chances of being right or being correct on that specific trade now beyond that guys this is not something you need to go out and just start doing you have to test for this you have to test and see well what is my likelihood of winning when I placed this trade based on the strategy I've created let's say with RSI being oversold or overbought at levels of structure there's a way to test that guys you can test it using swapping back and forth between daily and four-hour in one-hour charts maybe having all three of them on the screen at the same time I know it's hard work and it sounds like a lot of time you're gonna have spend doing it and that's true but it is completely and utterly necessary for you to do that those are the secrets that we use each and every time we place a trade if you guys are interested in being notified about the advanced pattern mastery course the links in the description if you

certain period of time a daily chart would be a representation of a full day of price if this was a one-hour chart and not a daily chart it would be a representation of one day of price and what they need to be recognized as is with a green candle the green candle normally represents an update meaning that this area here is the open the bottom of the body is the open this here is the low it is the low point of the pot of the candle the bottom of that wick is the low point of this 24-hour period represented by our green candle this high point is the high of this 24-hour period and this is the close of that candle so if this candle would have started at 5:00 p.m. and then ended at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time then this is exactly what it would look like if we had an open here price moved down from our open to our low price then moved back up to our high and then price came back down and finally closed right here that is exactly what these candlesticks mean that's a great presentation of a green candlestick or a positive day in price if you're looking at a daily chart a negative day is shown by this red candle here so on this red candle we have a very similar setup except instead of the bottom of the body being to open on a red candle the top of the body is the open the top of this wick is still the high of this candle the bottom wick is still the low of this candle and the bottom of the body is the close of this candle so in the representation of this candle what we would have seen if we were watching this on a daily chart is this candle would have opened here it then went to pushed up to the high and then pushed all the way down to the low and then eventually pushed back up to close that 24-hour period right there at the bottom of this red candle so that's how you see a candlestick and that's how that's how you break down the anatomy of each and every one of these candlesticks it represents a certain amount of time depending on the time period your own everything would be exactly the same if this was one hour instead of daily this was one hour then that would still be the exact same anatomy of a candlestick so now that we've broken debt that down a little bit let's head down to a different white screen and take a look at the four green candles we were looking at right at the intro of the video so now can you spot the similarities of any of these right now what I'm gonna do is go ahead and tell you the similarity and teach you the candlestick pattern that I never hear talked about here on YouTube and that I think is one of the most accurate candlestick patterns you can use for a buying trade and that is each one of these candles closes in the top 95% of the candle each one of these candles has either a tiny wick on it or no wick on the top at all and with these being green candles what that means is that the end of whatever time period let's just say we're still on the daily for simplicity at the end whatever time period we are looking at this candle closed nearly at its high at the highest point that the participants of the market pushed this candle it dropped barely any which means there was not many sellers at the end of this candle at the end of this period if we have little to no wicks on the top of these candles that means there were no sellers at the end of this period so that gives us a good representation that we could possibly see a market head higher from a candlestick like this and the way I defined this whenever I'm trading on a 4-hour chart I'm mostly trade on for hour and you can set a Fibonacci retracement like this let me go and show you how to identify the candle so you can take a Fibonacci retracement let me put it on my candle you can then adjust your Fibonacci retracement number change it to 0.05 percent and now all you have to ask yourself is did this candle you pull a retracement from the low of the candle to the the candle did this candle land the body of the candle close above the top 5% of the candle and if the answer is yes then you have a correct candlestick formation and as you can tell each of these do that so that's one way to spot this gamma stick pattern what I do is just look for the market to only have a 5 pip wick at the top of the candle or less 5 to 6 fifths is the max so a max 5 to 6 pip wick on the top of the candle when I'm trading on a 4-hour chart but you can also use the Fibonacci tool that might make it a little bit easier for you like I said grab your Fibonacci tool with the correct setting of a 5% top 5% of the candle and then there we have it every time you want to see if you are trading the correct pattern you can just use the Fibonacci tool and make sure that that candlestick closed in the top 5% and again if it did close in that top 5% then chances are there was no buying meaning excuse me there was no selling pressure at the end of that time period so chances are there's gonna be buying pressure in the next period and that's what makes this candlestick pattern so powerful now let's move on to actually finding a few of these on sharp data and then I'll teach you a full strategy you can actually test and show you my back testing data of that strategy right after we go over this candlestick pattern on actual charts see you in just a second"", ""alright so now that we've quickly been over the anatomy of a candlestick let's jump into what these candlesticks actually represent and then later on we'll discuss how we can use candlestick charts to predict market direction all right guys so let's dive into what these candlesticks actually represents well each one of these candlesticks represents a specific time period if I click over here on time periods you can see that we have time periods ranging from one minute all the way to one month so with that being the case if we were to click the one-minute chart then each candlestick would represent one minute or 60 seconds of price action we would have the open of a candlestick every 60 seconds on that one-minute candlestick chart we would have price fluctuating within those 60 seconds down to the low up to the high and then we would also have the close of a candle every 60 seconds so each one of these candlesticks would represent 60 seconds on a one-minute chart and if we were on a one-month chart if we go all the way to the other end of the spectrum then the same rules apply if we were only one month chart if we were to click this one month chart here then each candlestick on that chart would represent four weeks of price action we would have an opened at the beginning of the four weeks we would have price action in between the four weeks going to the low and the high of the wick or the shadows of the candles and that's what would represent where price actions been and then we would have a close of the candle at the end of four weeks all of this is represented about one candlestick depending on the time frame your own so currently we're on a one-week chart that means that when we scroll down the chart here each one of these candlesticks represent a full week of price action for the green candlesticks we have a full week of price action that started at the open or the bottom of the green candle we have price action in between represented by these wicks coming down to the low and moving up to the high and then at the end of the week we have the close of the candle so that represents a bullish week in price action for our current pair currently we are only pound allsey so for this pair during this full week of price action we had a bullish week represented by this candle now the same thing applies for a bearish week and I'll go through that really quickly so for this case we have an open at the top of the body is where this market opened we have where price has been represented by the wicks the high and the low of the red candle and the close of the candle at the end of the week at the bottom of that body so that would represent a bearish week of price action and again guys these same rules apply no matter what time frame we're on and this can go anywhere from a 1-minute chart all the way up to a one-month chart so each one of these candlesticks represents a certain period of time and once we start putting these candlesticks together is when we can start determining market Direction based on candlestick charts so that's what we're gonna dive into now so combining all of these candlesticks together is how we can start to actually determine market direction and determine trend and also determine structure levels such as support and resistance and these are going to all be foundational parts of success in any trading career on any market understanding how to read a candlestick chart is the foundation of any good trading strategy so we have a starting point down here correct this market pushed up from this level with a nice impulsive move indicating a lot of buyers coming in from that direction now we're looking for next is to see if that level is broken so we have a high and when I say high this time I'm not talking about the high of a single candlestick I'm talking about the high that's represented about the combination of candlesticks throughout this impulsive move up which was right here the high is what's created before the pullback so this pullback represents people selling from the market a combination of people selling and the reason they're selling can be because of many different factors some people that were in down here at this level that we started from are now just taking profit other people may be jumping in based on some type of fundamental news release or based on some type of technical analysis but all of that is really irrelevant information because all we want to do is look at the chart and understand what it's doing so once we've created that high we're looking for a pullback and then the creation of a new high this 3-point move is how we can start to determine market direction once we have this 3-point move a low to a high to a pullback or higher low to a new high once that's created then we can determine that the market direction is currently up the market Direction is bullish and with that being the case we have the ability to restrict ourselves to only bullish trades to only long trades and this can really be beneficial to a trading strategy now what are we looking for after this 3-point move and this is where a lot of traders get confused well we're looking for this uptrend to continue before the break of our support level this is our support level so before this support level gets broken we expect the market to come up and break above this resistance level and continue our uptrend and that's exactly what we get here we have this pullback again selling pressure from taking profit from traders taking positions based on fundamental news events and traders taking positions based on technical analysis and then we have another push up continuing our uptrend because we've now broken above our previous high and since we have a break above our previous high into a new high we expecting we're expecting another new high""]"

7,6,204,6_tesla_ev_teslas_ford,"['tesla', 'ev', 'teslas', 'ford', 'musk', 'elon', 'cars', 'vehicles', 'tesla stock', 'elon musk']","[""five being a sell analysts are writing tesla as a 2.3 meaning it is a buy and right now the average analyst price target is 306 dollars and 10 cents which is a few percent over the current price of 288 dollars and nine cents so since thursday tesla stock has been much much cheaper due to a three for one stock split after the closing bell on wednesday this is beneficial for retail investors because now it's much more easy to own at least one share of the stock meanwhile investors who've held onto stock for a long time will still retain the same value that they originally had in the company they'll just have three times as many shares with each share at a lower price tesla stock split is also bullish news because it indicates how well the company is doing for shares to be really expensive per share that it must cut down stock price to bring in more investors is an awesome sign and tesla being known as the innovator in ev manufacturing has set shock waves throughout the rest of the auto industry recently ford laid off 3 000 employees just to cut costs as the company transitions to ev and based on the company's most recent earnings report which occurred during the middle of last month we can definitely see why tesla is now the face and model of the automobile industry the company's revenues increased year over year by around 42 to 16.9 billion dollars while the company's gross profits increased year over year by around 47 to 4.2 billion dollars and there are plenty of reasons to anticipate more growth but the biggest reason is the arrival of more eevee battery manufacturing in america specifically panasonic is considering another large-scale u.s battery cell factory which could bode very well for ev companies especially tesla who have been relying on china's manufacture and export of ev batteries for a long time hopefully having more eevee battery manufacturing in america would cut costs increase convenience improve logistics and also bring more business into the country which would be a huge benefit yielded by tesla's innovation i think tesla's always going to be an overpriced company but it's definitely a very interesting company and stock has performed really well throughout the last few years"", ""but if they're stuttering a little bit on their ev rollout with the truck maybe they won't be the leader in ev pickup trucks that they hope to be so i would just caution investors not to just look at their production delivery numbers but also look at the customer reception of their cars ford is projecting for between 10 and 15 of total vehicle production growth in 2022 and north america just continues to be by far the most profitable segment in fact they've lost money in their other major geographies now they did say that they're improving kind of their manufacturing process and roll out those geographies so they should improve this year but again they expect i think a 10 margin in north america which is really impressive the big thing with ford is that they are continuing to grow profit and earn a ton of free cash flow while investing in evs which is a really really big theme that i think makes ford one of the best all-around ev stocks to buy because what it essentially is doing which is something that disney did with disney plus that meta platforms is doing with its metaverse rollout that oil and gas companies are doing with renewable energy investments is it's taking this core business and then allocating extra profits to grow this entirely new business and that's a really big advantage than having to raise more money or go to capital markets for debt which is very challenging in a time of higher interest rates like we are now so ford really doesn't have that problem because it can bankroll its ev business with its ice business so that's just something to really keep in mind kind of how will its margins eventually take a hit probably not in 2022 but maybe in 2023 and 2024 when they bring that ev capacity up to 600 000 vehicles per year i would just be curious to see how that impacts their profitability another big thing with ford is they reinstated their dividend"", ""and they're going to lean towards leasing out one of their facilities now with that being said guys is this the time to buy Mullins stock I do consider grabbing a small position here early in the month of June may be a great idea but far as jumping off the deep end I would just wait until the announcement that production has started for those chassis ladies and gentlemen now with Mullen actually focusing on this commercial vehicles they will in fact have an edge over these other startup EV companies due to the fact that we all know that these major auto manufacturers has an edge when it comes to getting their cars to the market due to the fact they already have the real estate they already have these dealerships on every single corner and I'm talking about your Chevy dealerships your Buick the list goes on anything under the General Motors umbrella also Ford has car lots everywhere so getting their product to Market is much much faster for these major your auto manufacturers not only that their production capability allows them to sell their cars a little bit cheaper than what these startup EV companies are going to have to deal with also we already know cars sell off of culture and a loyal fan base so for instance a lawyer or a doctor that continues to drive Mercedes-Benz and when they want to convert over to EV now they have their electric Mercedes-Benz available ladies and gentlemen that is why I feel as though that Mullen will not win the war when it comes to general purpose vehicles but with them actually focusing on their commercial side of things that is currently a untapped market and it has huge huge potential we can see these type of things apply to distribution centers ladies and gentlemen warehouses and much much more especially Mullins Battery Technology last year the CEO did make a statement saying that they are in talks with OEM companies about their Battery Technology and we're about the solid polymer State Battery ladies and gentlemen not m-a-e-o and the CEO said they are in talks with Outsourcing that technology to OEM companies and that is the type of companies guys like the electric pallet jacks we might be able to find that Battery Technology in if Mullen wants to Outsource it to them um reach trucks uh forklifts the list goes on guys uh Mullen has a octopus style reach they can actually do a lot of things once this solid polymer State Battery Technology is completely looked over completely reviewed and um and we get all the data and feedback off of that guys I believe that that is going to be mullen's wild card for sure so with that being said guys if you agree with anything I said in this video can you

of the cold wallet may be compromised so let's start with one of the best known cold storage wallets ledger like other hardware wallets ledger allows users to own their own keys and store their crypto offline on a separate device there are currently three ledger wallet types nano x ledger nano s plus and ledger nano s distorts cryptos and nfts all ledgers have a durable metal casing and smaller screen ledger nano x is the premium wallet that's compatible with desktop computers and thanks to bluetooth pairing can also be connected to smartphones the device uses bluetooth low energy connectivity that only transports public data ensuring private data never leaves the device ledger secure element or se requests consent for any action in the wallet there is no need to worry about the bluetooth connection getting hacked both the nano x and nano s plus allow users to interact with d5 and nfts and the ledger nano s is the company's cheapest cold wallet that simply stores crypto assets this basic version will run you about 85 bucks and"", ""the nano x retails for around 200 ledger devices support over a thousand coins and tokens and can be connected to hot wallets like metamask or access dapps ledger live is a software app companion with easy to access d5 platforms has a fiat on-ramp to buy crypto as well as in exchange for trading the app offers other services like staking and ways to pay for everyday items with crypto ledger devices are one of the most recommended cold wallets because they store crypto safely and still let holders interact with decentralized apps they even come in pretty colors treasure cold wallets are another popular option with a larger screen and various types of cases from metal to plastic trezor's model t supports more than twelve hundred coins and securely manages digital identity through tested protocols like ssh or secure child network communication in gpg public key cryptography that verifies if a message's origin is genuine the model t is treasurer's premium offering that will run you about 295 bucks treasurer model 1 supports more than a thousand coins can be connected through all major computing operating systems it has a bigger display screen and is compatible with many wallet apps in the past church's popularity lagged behind ledger because it didn't support eip712 causing nfts that use this kind of hashing and signing to get stuck on the treasurer device the user is only able to retrieve them by restoring the wallet on another platform the ip712 is a more advanced and safer transaction signature method but thankfully metamask announced an update that allows trezor users to interact with secondary markets with eip712 support now nft collectors can interact with openc and looks rare by using a browser extension connecting a trezor wallet to metamask browser extension recent firmware updates unlocked the model t to interact with cardano smart contracts as well from the alonzo era of onward

so it can be programmed to send back anything that's requested now this is actually required in order for the device to upgrade and support newer chains whenever there's a new app being installed on

requires a quote minimal amount of trust this means that every time you've had to approve an upgrade on a ledger device you've had to have trust and as we all know trust is a dirty word in crypto it goes against the ethos on which trustless blockchains are built moreover as I mentioned earlier it's not about trust in Ledger per se but trusting that they won't have to comply with any sort of government requests now Ledger's co-founder and ex-ceo created a Reddit post where he addressed the debacle and said that technically governments could recover the shards and quote get access to your funds I will caveat though that this was in the context of the recover shards and not the issuance of poisoned updates but surely the principle should be the same in a recent podcast the current CEO also waved that subpoena concern Away by saying that it's quote not that common however he was reminded that coinbase was recently subpoenaed for something as simple as customer data I'll leave a link to that podcast in the description for you folks now one of the reasons for this miscommunication and subsequent PR disaster is that Ledger's code is closed Source users were never able to peer into the repositories and see how the secure element worked hence the reason that this all came as a shock so the result is that many are now calling for the code to be open sourced indeed I think that this is one of the only ways in which users can fully verify the security of the device as they say don't trust verify and this is also one of the reasons as to why I have always preferred Treasures over ledgers tresor's code is open source and hence there's no room for confusion as to how the devices operate moreover they have the option to generate more than one seed phrase through their Shamir backup now I've talked about this in much more detail in my Tresor video but it basically allows contingencies for seed loss without having to hand over seed phrases to the manufacturer or third-party custodians that said open source is no Silver Bullet by opening your code to the world you're also opening it up to all those who may want to exploit it moreover most treasure users don't read the code that's being pushed before choosing to upgrade I can't read firmware code myself and I am going to have to hope that the white hat hackers out there are better at auditing it than the black hats are so there is still an element of trust needed in third parties I'll also add that Tresor devices are vulnerable to what are termed high voltage glitching attacks now I won't go into the specifics of those here but I will link to a handy video by Kraken security Labs that discovered the exploit the caveat here though is that such an attack requires physical access to the device as well as the tools and Technical know-how to execute it and if you're looking for any other wallet Alternatives then you could consider a fully air-gapped kind these are Hardware wallets that have absolutely no connection to any network or pc be it through Wi-Fi Bluetooth USB""]"

has also increased the break-even price is now close to 20K anywho the fourth part of the report is about regulations the authors note that U.S politicians are preparing stablecoin regulations which we covered in a recent video and that the G20 is working on a global crypto framework they also touch on the eu's mica crypto regulations which were finally passed just recently I'll quickly note that the financial stability board or FSB will be releasing Global crypto regulation recommendations this summer for context the FSB is an unaccountable and unelected organization closely aligned with U.S interests and it looks like its recommendations will be very anti-crypto now what's awesome is that the authors provide an amazing visualization of mica's key Provisions the most important one is that D5 protocols will not be regulated so long as they are sufficiently decentralized unfortunately the EU seems to be working on D5 specific regulations too make no mistake crypto regulations are required for the next crypto bull run to begin luckily there are many places that are in the process of passing Pro crypto regulations and not just the EU the authors note this in their forecast these crypto regulations will increase crypto's legitimacy and I couldn't help but notice that the authors provided a score for each of these crypto niches surprisingly the scores for Bitcoin defy and Mining were all four out of five not surprisingly the score for regulation is two and this makes me wonder what categories 5 and 1 look like in the eyes of the authors on that note the fifth part of the report is about derivatives which the authors put down as a three out of five they reiterate that the cme's Bitcoin option Futures have hit record levels of open interest they also note that the annualized basis yield for BTC suggests that investors are becoming more uncertain for reference the BTC annualized basis yield quote represents the cost or benefit of holding a long position in Bitcoin Futures and can provide insight into the market sentiment of Futures Traders as you can see this yield has been declining signaling a potentially bearish short-term trend this relates to the author's forecast wherein they note that bullish Traders are betting on btc's price to be 32k at the end of May and bearish Traders are betting on btc's price to be 25k at the end of May specifically the 26th of May the authors note that these were the same targets Traders had last month now I'd be remiss if I didn't mention all the volatility that's being caused by leveraged trading these days if you've been keeping up with our weekly crypto reviews you'll know that long liquidations and short squeezes have been primary drivers of price action in recent weeks and this seems to be getting worse what this means is that you need to be very careful when you're trading and be aware of all the key levels that your favorite cryptos could go to if they pump or dump and if you have no idea what key levels are I suggest subscribing to coin Bureau trading Dan will tell you everything you need to know the link is up in the top right now the sixth part of the report is about venture capital or VC the authors restate that VC investing went up by 170 in April totaling almost 900 million dollars the breakdown of where all that money went can be seen here While most of the deals were in defy most of the money went to infrastructure the authors underscore a whopping 220 million dollar investment in core weave a quote specialized cloud provider however it's not entirely clear if core weave is a crypto project it doesn't seem to have a white paper or token but Ico drops notes that it will be selling an erc20 token soon take note in their forecast the author's cautioned that although the month-over-month increase in VC investing is impressive it's not a trend this can clearly be seen in the infographic they provide crypto VC investing fell off a cliff last year and hasn't yet recovered even so there's still lots of money being thrown around the authors stress that crypto VC investment is heavily dependent on macro factors namely interest rates so long as the FED continues to keep rates High speculative VC investing will be minimal and this further underscores the fact that the crypto projects raising money now are very high quality take note I'll also quickly note that the authors gave this crypto Niche a 4 out of 5 which again begs the question of what a five looks like now the seventh part of the report is about nfts the authors note that quote there are concerns about the nft market going into freefall hence the two out of five rating their evidence for this free fall is the 65 decline in nft sales and the 50 drop in active wallets"", ""welcome back everyone for another look at what's\xa0 happening in crypto around the world now we spend\xa0\xa0 a lot of time covering goings-on in the United\xa0 States but today it's time to forget about debt\xa0\xa0 ceiling debates Fed rate hikes and ripple versus\xa0 the SEC and instead turn the focus elsewhere\xa0\xa0 so join me for a look at some headlines\xa0 from some other corners of the cryptoverse\xa0\xa0 we don't have to travel far from the US for our\xa0 first story though just across the border into\xa0\xa0 Canada in fact Canada as you may know is where\xa0 binance CEO CZ hails from but that hasn't stopped\xa0\xa0 his exchange from packing up and leaving the\xa0 country on the 12th of May binance tweeted that\xa0\xa0 it would quote be joining other prominent crypto\xa0 businesses in proactively withdrawing from the\xa0\xa0 Canadian Marketplace unfortunately new guidance\xa0 related to stable coins and investor limits\xa0\xa0 provided to crypto exchanges makes the Canada\xa0 Market no longer tenable for binance at this time\xa0\xa0 now this follows the introduction of\xa0 new guidance by the Canadian Securities\xa0\xa0 administrators CSA back in February that put\xa0 significant constraints on how binance and\xa0\xa0 other crypto exchange platforms can operate\xa0 in the land of mounties maple syrup and moose\xa0\xa0 now it seems that binance had initially attempted\xa0 to comply when Bloomberg reported on the matter\xa0\xa0 back in April it stated that the new rules called\xa0 for quote unregistered crypto trading platforms\xa0\xa0 operating in the country to commit to a so-called\xa0 pre-registration undertaking firms are required\xa0\xa0 to follow tougher regulations on segregating\xa0 customer assets and prohibited from offering\xa0\xa0 margin or leverage to users in Canada now other\xa0 operators such as okx dydx and paxos had already\xa0\xa0 signaled their intent to leave the country but\xa0 binance did reportedly file that pre-registration\xa0\xa0 undertaking before giving up the ghost users now\xa0 have until the end of September to close out their\xa0\xa0 positions and find alternative platforms now this\xa0 move by the CSA could well be related to the news\xa0\xa0 that the development of Canada's Central Bank\xa0 digital currency or cbdc is continuing a pace\xa0\xa0 earlier this month the Bank of Canada announced\xa0 a public consultation for its cbdc which follows\xa0\xa0 earlier such consultations on crypto and\xa0 stablecoins according to crypto slate quote\xa0\xa0 the bank is primarily interested in learning about\xa0 how Canadians would use the digital dollar what\xa0\xa0 security features are crucial and what concerns\xa0 citizens with regard to cbdc's accessibility\xa0\xa0 and privacy the announcement also noted that\xa0 cash usage would remain the same even if the\xa0\xa0 Canadian digital dollar is rolled out one day\xa0 crypto and especially stable coins are viewed\xa0\xa0 by many central banks and governments as direct\xa0 competitors to cbdc's and it's no surprise then\xa0\xa0 that the crypto industry in Canada is coming under\xa0 pressure as a result that said it does seem like\xa0\xa0 the Bank of Canada is at least making a decent\xa0 effort to give Canadians a say when it comes\xa0\xa0 to their cbdc which is more than can be said for\xa0 other countries that famed Canadian politeness a\xa0\xa0 meanwhile binance is also finding itself under\xa0 the Cosh in Australia it suffered a double whammy\xa0\xa0 last week when Westpac the country's oldest bank\xa0 announced a ban on transactions to a number of\xa0\xa0 crypto exchanges including Finance Australia\xa0 this came on the same day that the exchange\xa0\xa0 was forced to suspend Aussie dollar Services\xa0 after its payment provider withdrew its support\xa0\xa0 it's part of an all too familiar tale sadly\xa0 authorities in Australia as in many other\xa0\xa0 countries are getting spooked by crypto in a big\xa0 way now one of the reasons cited for this latest\xa0\xa0 action against binance is the amount of money\xa0 lost to crypto scammers in recent years which is\xa0\xa0 certainly a big problem in Australia and elsewhere\xa0 it is worth noting though that cracking down on\xa0\xa0 exchanges like binance is not going to make that\xa0 problem go away nor does it do anything meaningful\xa0\xa0 to crack down on the scammers themselves sure\xa0 it might inconvenience those scammers a little\xa0\xa0 bit but the real losers here are the ordinary\xa0 upstanding people looking to trade crypto dig\xa0\xa0 a Little Deeper of course and a familiar culprit\xa0 emerges yup cbdc's The Reserve Bank of Australia\xa0\xa0 is Keen on them too coincidence"", ""but\xa0 there's clearly opposition from many quarters\xa0\xa0 which means that the signing of regulations\xa0 into law may not be a straightforward process\xa0\xa0 however a few days after the select committee\xa0 had made its feelings known a contradictory view\xa0\xa0 was expressed by the international organization of\xa0 Securities commissions iosco a watchdog group made\xa0\xa0 up of regulators from 130 jurisdictions and one\xa0 which I must admit I'm not all that familiar with\xa0\xa0 iosco which includes the UK's Financial conduct\xa0 Authority and the ussec among its members called\xa0\xa0 for the UK to regulate cryptocurrencies quote in\xa0 the same way as traditional assets such as stocks\xa0\xa0 and bonds according to the guardian doing so quote\xa0 includes requiring trading platforms to publicly\xa0\xa0 disclose how they vet crypto assets before\xa0 allowing them to be traded clearly explain how\xa0\xa0 they store and Safeguard clients crypto assets\xa0 and ensure they are separated from the firm's\xa0\xa0 own assets that might be used for proprietary\xa0 trading in short then a lot of compliance would\xa0\xa0 be required from exchanges and other similar\xa0 platforms which makes sense in the wake of the\xa0\xa0 collapse of Celsius Voyager FTX Etc the view\xa0 expressed by the treasury select committee\xa0\xa0 however is that regulating crypto in the same way\xa0 as other assets would create a quote halo effect\xa0\xa0 which could mislead consumers into thinking that\xa0 investing in crypto is safer than it actually is\xa0\xa0 which I think kind of misses the point I would\xa0 argue that anyone investing in crypto is well\xa0\xa0 aware of the risks involved and that treating\xa0 it the same as gambling would merely encourage\xa0\xa0 people to act even more irresponsibly than many\xa0 of them already do that said of course gambling\xa0\xa0 isn't taxed in the UK so if the treasury\xa0 select committee has its way well I'm sure\xa0\xa0 many would be absolutely delighted okay time to\xa0 end this Roundup on a high note by stopping off\xa0\xa0 in Hong Kong as I'm sure you're all aware retail\xa0 trading of cryptocurrencies will become legal in\xa0\xa0 the china-controlled city-state very soon and in\xa0 just a few days time on the 1st of June exchanges\xa0\xa0 there will be able to apply for a license from\xa0 the city's Securities and Futures commission sfc\xa0\xa0 to operate now a few things to be aware of before\xa0 you get too excited first up it looks like only\xa0\xa0 the major cryptos like BTC eth and a few others\xa0 will be accessible to investors in Hong Kong as\xa0\xa0 Bloomberg reported quote individual investors\xa0 can trade larger coins on exchanges licensed by\xa0\xa0 the sfc under Hong Kong's new approach safeguards\xa0 include knowledge tests appropriate risk profiling\xa0\xa0 and reasonable limits on exposure the coins should\xa0 be included in at least two acceptable investable\xa0\xa0 indexes from independent providers one with\xa0 experience in the traditional financial sector\xa0\xa0 now it's unclear which cryptos besides BTC and\xa0 eth meet this criteria but the list is likely to\xa0\xa0 be limited so although retail Traders will be able\xa0 to invest through licensed and heavily regulated\xa0\xa0 exchanges only a handful of larger cryptos will be\xa0 accessible to them and they will likely be heavily\xa0\xa0 vetted by said exchanges in order to satisfy the\xa0 powers that be that they know what they're doing\xa0\xa0 so don't count on a flood of inexperienced newbies\xa0 piling into ship on the 1st of June in other words\xa0\xa0 now of course the really big question here is\xa0 just how much pent-up Chinese money is going to\xa0\xa0 find its way into the crypto market via Hong Kong\xa0 China is notorious for its strict Capital controls\xa0\xa0 and the CCP will not be Keen to see a flight\xa0 from the Yuan to BTC eth and others inflows\xa0\xa0 from the mainland are likely to be restricted and\xa0 closely monitored that said this could well Mark\xa0\xa0 the beginning of a pivot towards crypto by China\xa0 as it looks to capitalize on the US's rejection of\xa0\xa0 the industry as I and many others have been saying\xa0 the next Bull Run could well begin in the East and\xa0\xa0 so we need to watch what happens in Hong Kong over\xa0 the coming weeks and months very closely but let's\xa0\xa0 leave the last word on this to Mr binance himself\xa0 CZ on the 24th of May he tweeted quote CCTV China\xa0\xa0 central television just broadcasted""]"
10,9,138,9_bank_banks_banking_valley,"['bank', 'banks', 'banking', 'valley', 'deposits', 'money', 'reserve', 'crisis', 'assets', 'maturity']","[""that's another problem here's the thing is most of you know anytime you make a deposit within a bank you're protected by what's called FDIC insurance which protects up to the first two hundred and fifty thousand dollars you have deposited in the event of a bank failure this was created after the bank runs the 1920s Great Depression as a way to incentivize people to re-trust the banking system and it largely worked since then FDIC insurance has continued to evolve for any Bank who wants to legally operate in the United States and the good news is that it's a fairly efficient system in fact their website says that you could get access to your money within a few days after the bank's closing however in this case the bad news is that as Genevieve from grit Capital points out only two point seven percent of silicon Valley's Bank deposits are less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars meaning ninety seven point three percent of their money is not FDIC insured and it's not clear exactly what's going to happen to all of that money now typically in cases where deposits exceed the FDIC limit losses are recovered in a bankruptcy court when assets are sold off to pay their creditors but his bank rate explains that process could take several years to complete and more than likely their customers are not going to receive all of their money back from what they started with although to me that isn't even the worst of it instead it's just how far this is about to reach over the coming few days and weeks and I have a feeling this is really only the tip of the iceberg for those in aware Silicon Valley Bank isn't just a bank for the average person they're the bank for a significant portion of venture-backed companies throughout the United States and when those businesses keep a significant portion or even all of their money with one institution they could be completely wiped out overnight the reality is many of these institutions have raised millions or even tens of millions of dollars with the expectation that that's going to be enough to last them throughout these next few years those businesses have carefully saved money kept it liquid for emergencies and have spent it wisely only to have it reduced to 250 000 overnight from that perspective this is going to be crippling to every single business that banks with Silicon Valley Bank especially since they currently hold more than 342 billion dollars worth of customer funds now realistically a startup is not going to lose all their money with the bank and it's not like every dollar over 250 000 is suddenly worth zero but it could take years to recover whatever's left and whether or not the company has enough money to stay afloat in the meantime is completely up in the air I would venture to say that most of them cannot just consider that everything from payroll company expenditures and all of their overheads could be held in One bank and 250 000 could be a drop in the buck pocket for a company who had saved significantly more to make it through a time of slower growth there's really no way out of this with the exception of trying to raise cash as desperately as possible in a panic at a discount downsizing significantly or going under which is something that no one thought would happen just a week ago so that then of course begs the question could the same thing happen to your bank the answer is it's possible but it's unlikely the issue with Silicon Valley Bank was that they were in a niche market servicing startups and were funded by Venture Capital which was drying up that meant that very little money was flowing in a lot of money was flowing out and the majority of the bank's Capital was locked away in bonds for the next four years at a low interest rate that had declined in value essentially this meant that if the bank were to wait long enough they would have enough cash on hand and potentially absorb the short-term losses but when everyone begins withdrawing all of their money all at the exact same time the bank is left with no other choice other than to shut down now sure in essence every every single Bank operates this way and is only required to keep 10 percent of customer funds on hand at all time to process withdrawals but in Silicon Valley Bank's case they went all in on the bond market at the worst possible time at the very Peak"", ""he explained that the desire to develop an alternative to bailouts increased after the financial crisis started to affect Europe in mid-2012 the international monetary fund or IMF published a paper advocating for bailins as the ideal alternative to bailouts the IMF paper had almost the same title as The Economist article by Paul and Wilson from two years earlier all the IMF needed was somewhere to test this new Balin method enter Cyprus now Cyprus was one of the European countries that was hit the hardest when the 2008 contagion spread to the continent by the end of 2012 Cyprus was on the brink of default and begging for a bailout in early 2013 the IMF and the European Union bailed Cyprus out for 10 billion euros as with all IMF loans the bailout came with multiple conditions one of the conditions was for cyprus's largest bank to execute the first ever bail in almost 50 percent of all bank account balances worth more than one hundred thousand Euros were seized a substantial proportion of these funds reportedly belonged to Russian oligarchs Cyprus was also required to take 6.9 percent of all Bank balances lower than 100 000 and 9.9 percent of all Bank balances higher than 100 000 regardless of the bank despite the social chaos and capital controls that ensued the first ever Bank Balin was declared a success by the IMF and its allies in 2014 the G20 countries agreed to pass bail in laws in accordance with the financial stability board or fsbs bail in guidelines the fsb's guidelines include the issuance of bail in bonds which should be sold to Pension funds newsflash this means your pension money could be used to bail out Banks too the United States was the first to legalize bailins in 2010 with the aforementioned Dodd-Frank Act the UK followed suit in 2013 with the financial services act the EU legalized bailins in 2016 with the bank recovery and resolution directive so be sure to check when your country legalized bailins and if you think this is crazy you should check out our video about digital ID that will be down in the description anyways I must stress that the specifics of Bank Balin laws tend to vary from country to Country unfortunately I don't have the time to get into the details about each one here however all these bailing laws seem to follow the same three rules likely because of their Collective Conformity with the FSB the first rule is that bank balines are only allowed for banks that are deemed to be domestically or globally important it's not entirely clear which banks fall into the domestically important category but it's safe to assume that this rule pertains to those with the most assets under management as for globally important Banks the FSB publishes a list of them every year along with their de facto risk of default due to derivatives debt there are currently 30 globally systemically important banks with JP Morgan being noted as the highest risk JB Morgan reportedly has 60 to 70 trillion dollars of derivatives dead if you're wondering what happens when a non-systemically important Bank goes under the answer seems to be that they get to be acquired by a domestically or globally important Bank if that wasn't wild enough Regulators are trying to apply these laws to crypto exchanges more on that in a moment now the second rule of bank balins is that they do not apply to bank balances below the deposit Insurance threshold in the U.S the FDIC covers 250 000 of deposits in the UK the fscs covers 85 000 pounds and in the EU"", ""2021 annual report suggests that it only has around 120 billion dollars in its Insurance Fund this is a drop in the bucket compared to the 19 trillion dollars of Bank deposits in the U.S and a speck of sand in the desert of the derivatives Market which could be in the quadrillions luckily there's the third rule of bank balins which states that you will be given some alternative asset in exchange for your lost deposits now believe it or not but these alternative assets are typically shares in the bank that you bailed out let that sink in the bank takes your money and gives you its worthless stock in return not only that but if governments manage to pass laws to make Central Bank digital currencies or cbdc's legal tender you could very well be paid back in cbdc instead of cash come to think of it bank balance would be the perfect way to force people to adopt cbdc's and perhaps that's the whole point speculation aside it's important to note that you could temporarily lose access to your funds during a bank Balin as we've seen with Cyprus Banks could put limits on their hours of operations limits on payments limits on transfers and limits on cash withdrawals until the bail in process is complete more evidence comes from a bank Balin document from the Bank of Scotland which suggests that it could take up to a week for you to get your insured deposits back I imagine there would be a similar lag for other banks around the world make no mistake the social unrest that would trigger would be truly unprecedented now the people in power appear to be hyper aware of this because they've apparently been running Bank Balin simulations for years the most recent high-profile Bank simulation was held by the FDIC in November last year although the FDIC simulation is publicly available it's predictably hard to find the simulation featured dozens of panelists from prominent financial institutions and Regulators that you've probably never heard of as you might have guessed one of them was Wilson Irvin who seems to keep a very low profile these days despite or maybe because of being the Chief Architect of the bank Balin process now I'll leave a link to the full simulation in the description if you're interested but I'll reiterate that it's hard to find even with the link I'll also caution that it's lengthy and contains lots of financial jargon in any case the most exciting stuff begins around the one hour mark Snippets from this section went viral at roughly 1 hour and 18 minutes one of the panelists Ponders how the FDIC and its secret allies should maintain the Public's confidence in the financial system when the balines inevitably happen she argues that transparency is the answer but that some entities should get more transparency than others this particular panelist also made an off-the-cuff comment about making sure the public understands that quote prior compensation could be clawed back now maybe I'm hearing things but that sounds like it's possible for the banks to take your money long after the bailing process has been completed she even asked the other panelists how they can quote address excess cash use in such a crisis this suggests that governments could very well be planning on introducing a cbdc using bank balins then again it could just be a reference to the freeze on cash withdrawals I was talking about earlier as a cherry on top the panelist also said that they should quote make the announcement on a Friday ideally a Friday night for context Fridays are famous for being one of the days when nobody pays attention to the news hence why bad news often comes out on Fridays the more you know a second panelist agreed with the first about being selective with transparency about the bailin and specified that they should tell the banks and big investors first he said they shouldn't tell the public until later because they would Panic a third panelist agreed with the second and said something sinister along the lines of the public has more faith in the banking system than we do let's keep it that way the other panelists laughed he went on to repeat that only institutional investors should know what's going on and they should quote be careful with what we tell the public but wait there's more a fourth panelist then said something even more Sinister I had to listen to it three times because I couldn't quite believe what I was hearing the timestamp is around 1 hour and 27 minutes she literally says quote the information should go out once we're moving out of the recession make of that what you will this fourth panelist went on to explain that non-bank entities including cryptocurrency exchanges should be included in the bailing process now this could mean that she wants them to be subject to acquisition by big Banks or that she wants to use the crypto you hold on exchanges to bail them in a little later Wilson said that they must make sure that disinformation about bank balins doesn't get out before the fact check approved version of events he even went as far as suggesting that this online censorship should happen in advance so that people don't talk about their money being taken it just so happens that governments around the world are in the process of rolling out exactly these kinds of online censorship laws and most of them will be going into Force later this year or next year you can find out all about that using the link in the description I strongly suggest watching that

changes interest rates or this quantitative easing going on all the stuff that I mean is quite important but it's not something that's novel it's not something that we can look out 20 years and make predictions on how that might impact our companies or impact the economy and we're much better off focusing our time on individual businesses and figuring out where we expect them to go so even very major financial events can look like you know mere blips on the radar for really high quality companies if we take a business like Apple which is an example used in this book you know Apple went through the global financial crisis in 2008 if you had held shears and Apple since like the 80s for example and you were extremely wealthy by now as you very well would be if you had the head she is since that point you know if you talk to her she hold it that's how she is since that point they're not going to go ahead and say you know I would have been so much wealthier of 2008 never happened that's that's irrelevant to what the business did it's irrelevant to Apple developing the iPhone and the iPad and continuing to grow and to offering Apple services and all these different things and you know largely we've got to think of the same way we've got to focus on individual companies you know take Warren Buffett's example Warren Buffett's investment and coca-cola as an example that was a relatively quick ten burger for him he's had another since then and his head dividend payments paved that investment off multiple times over so his is more than received his money back how he's received his money back several times just from dividend payments and it's yielding something like sixty percent a year and dividends on his original purchase price now if you go and talk to Warren Buffett about that coke investment he's got one of the best filters on the planet on them they're cut if you go and talk to him about his coke investment and and you say you know what went well what went poorly the last thing he's gonna say is you know"", ""but hopefully you get the point that a company for a company to go from let's say being worth a million dollars to worth a hundred million dollars is much more plausible and happens much more frequently than a company going from a billion dollars to a trillion dollars or a trillion dollars in this case with Apple to a hundred trillion dollars so we have to look for small companies that doesn't mean we look for tiny companies there are several examples in this book of businesses that were trading for right around a billion dollars that turned into hundred beggars and that's right about the cutoff where the author tends to draw the line in terms of companies that he's digging into for potential hundred Baggett's was right around that billion dollar market cap as typically where he's hunting as below that number criteria number six for finding a hundred bagger is that owner-operators are a mess a massively preferred when you're going on this hunt so if you have a business where the interest of the management are aligned as much as possible with the interest of the shareholder great things can happen it means that management is incentivized teas to grow the per share value of that stock and a great example of this is someone like Warren Buffett now Warren Buffett has over 99% of his personal net worth and his company Berkshire Hathaway so here's massively incentivized to do very shareholder-friendly activities within the company Berkshire Hathaway compare that to a business where you have management with no shareholding or very little shareholding in the business and the compensation package is purely based on short-term incentives like trying to get the stock price up and beat Knicks quarters earnings and rut largely forget what's happening over the long term you can have some much more powerful things happen when you have owner-operators at the helm people that truly understand what the business is all about and people that have their incentives aligned directly with the shareholders in that company so that's another really good length thing to look for when you're searching for hundred backers now the final two points here point seven end point eight are both around patience so point seven is something called using the coffee can approach so you may have heard this expression before but essentially it's all about buying the company buying the shares and those business sticking them in a coffee can once you've done your analysis largely the hunt for hundred burgers most of your work is done by buying well and then just sitting so once you've bought those shares spec them in a coffee can metaphorically at least we don't get physical shares anymore unfortunately"", ""i'm sure you guys have all heard of the term time in the market versus timing the market and well this is exactly what the term is talking about because instead of trying to make the most money now you just have to keep investing for longer to beat everyone else now before you even spend a dollar investing into any stocks you first need to know about what warren buffett looks for in the company that he's interested in let's take a look at how buffett and his business partner charlie munger approach investing through a set of simple philosophies and the less the less static there is in that intellectual process really the better off you are what is the intellectual process intellectual processes is defining your level defining your area of competence and valuing businesses and then within that area of competence finding whatever sells at the at the cheapest price in relation to value and there are all kinds of things i'm not competent to value we have to deal with things that we're capable of understanding and then once we're over that filter we have to have a business with some intrinsic characteristics that give it a durable competitive advantage so what can we learn about them first up you need to study the business not the stock you should not let the price of the stock affect how valuable it is which is why buffett advises anyone to learn the business take tesla stock for example right if you don't know much about electric cars will you truly be making an informed decision investing in a stock like tesla or neo next does the company have a durable competitive advantage in its market this is referring to the company's moat or what i like to call blue ocean if the company has an advantage over the rest of the competition it will be able to raise its prices without too many consequences we'll be talking more about this in a little bit but last up as a bonus let's take a look at something buffett said back in 1999 in a shareholder meeting that i think is super interesting you find small securities in your area of competence that you can understand the business i think you can and occasionally find little arbitrage situations or little wrinkles here and there in the market i think working with a very small sum that there is an opportunity to earn very high returns what i want to focus on in this clip is how he talks about finding small wrinkles in the market what he's trying to say is to find stocks that are currently being mispriced sometimes there are times when stocks have major sell-offs and that creates a window of opportunity for active investors to take advantage of but how do you know if a stock is being mispriced well two my favorite ways are by looking at the price to earnings and price to book ratio a p e ratio measures the company's current share price relative to its earnings per share meaning if it has a lower p e ratio it's considered to be undervalued many investors will say that it's better to buy shares in companies with a lower p e ratio because you would be paying less for every dollar of earnings that you receive so in other words buying at a discount now a pb ratio compares a company's market price to its book value meaning if it's pb ratio is under one then your stocks would cost less than what the company can you know theoretically sell for this for investors could mean that the stock is undervalued but it could also mean that there's something fundamentally wrong with the company now buffett's methodology in finding low price stocks also values things like the company's return on equity debt to equity ratio and profit margins a return on equity is often referred to as the measure of profitability in relation to equity which basically means how efficiently the business generates profits this is a really important financial ratio because it helps us understand how a business uses money so warren buffett he looks for stocks with a higher projected roe of at least 15 percent because that indicates that the company is more efficient at generating profit you'll also want to look at the roe over the course of five to ten years to see if they are getting more efficient because that would also be another really great sign now the debt to equity ratio is the total liabilities divided by shareholders equity which basically tells investors if the company is using more of equity or debt to fund their assets a high debt level compared to equity can result in volatile earnings so buffett actually prefers a company with a debt to equity ratio that is below 0.5 in other words for every 10 in equity the company should only have five dollars in debt this would indicate that the growth is being generated more from shareholder equity instead of borrowed money and last we have profit margins which are the company's net income divided by the revenue having a high profit margin suggests that a business is doing well""]"

bureau japan was only recently released so if you're a weeb or just happen to have a lot of japanese friends be sure to check it out and share it with anyone you think would like it now this brings me to the third channel which is not a foreign language channel but a completely new offering from the team here at coin bureau it's my pleasure to present coin bureau clips a new creation i've set in motion with the help of one of our latest additions to the team here coin bureau clips will contain boatloads of behind the scenes bloopers and video compilations from my tick tock and instagram as well as a host of my price predictions disclaimers and conclusions from this very channel coin bureau eclipse will also feature original crypto content that tilts more towards entertainment rather than education now i'll of course leave links to these channels as well as all the others i mentioned in the video description so be sure to check them out now to wrap things up i want to give you my two cents about the crypto content here on youtube for starters i'll reiterate that there are a lot of other cryptocurrency channels i follow that i didn't mention here i sometimes refer to them in my other videos or i share their content on my other social channels indeed i may come back with an update to this video in the near future at the end of the day if you're creating helpful crypto content and educating others i'm with you having said that the ones i selected today are the ones i watch the most and they're also the ones which have helped me create my own crypto content in other words they're a part of why the coin bureau now has the size and following we do this really can't be understated either because at the end of the day all that we're doing is aggregating and building on top of existing crypto content with the most up-to-date information there is this is much easier said than done because speed watching hours of interviews and digging through mountains of documents can and sometimes does lead to dead ends it takes a lot of time a lot of patience and a lot of manpower to put together the videos you see on this channel and not everyone is willing to put in this amount of work it's like coins versus tokens it's very difficult to create a cryptocurrency coin because you have to build the blockchain from the ground up"", ""but when he does post a video you know it's time to listen up more often than not the video is a detailed breakdown of the mentality you need to have going into the next phase of the crypto market cycle and what you should expect in terms of price and volatility i strongly recommend watching bob's first video about the four year cycle from january 2019 when you have the time it's incredible how many of the projections made back then continue to play out today as important as it is to have a long-term view we all know there's much more to crypto trading than ta being up to date with the latest crypto updates is crucial and when it comes to crypto news to me there's no better channel than digital asset news although i do go through all the latest crypto news on coin telegraph coindesk and decrypt every day i don't always click with all the headlines i read nor why what's being talked about is so important the daily videos done by rob at digital asset news help add some much needed context to these kinds of headlines and sometimes i even get filled in about a few important updates i missed because of this digital asset news has been extremely helpful for putting together my own weekly crypto news reviews and you can find the latest one up there in the top right in terms of which video you should check out well this would have to be the price predictions video i did with rob and dave back in june on the digital asset news clips channel something tells me you guys missed that one besides complex crypto news the one place where i frequently get lost is d5 now one of my favorite crypto content creators in this category is cinematics which arguably does the best job of explaining how all of cryptocurrency's top d5 protocols work finimatix also has a few videos about how certain layer 2 scaling solutions work including the lightning network which i recently covered myself cinematic's content has honestly saved my arse in the past when i was trying to understand complex defined apps like yearn finance and uni swap v3 i've also used a few of finematic's images in my videos now given that decentralized finance looks like it's going to be the future of finance you would be wise to familiarize yourself with the basics of defy and cinematics has a video that can help you get started now the thing about crypto though is that before you can understand things like decentralized finance it's often necessary to understand how legacy finance works this brings me to my next favorite crypto content creator and that's joe brown at heresy financial though joe is not necessarily a crypto content creator by trade he does frequently talk about where bitcoin fits into the broader financial system and why btc has value in that context if the channel name didn't give it away heresy financial has some pretty hot takes about almost every element of legacy finance joe explains these elements in a way that's easily digestible to someone with zero financial education and the content on his channel is a must watch my favorite flick is titled quote the origin of modern money and its dark future and it's one you absolutely must put on your watch list if you're serious about money and investing now the one topic that heresy financial doesn't tackle is crypto regulation but thankfully there's another incredible channel where you can go for exactly that if you're a fan of xrp or have just been

of what to expect one survey found that it was the easiest to cut back on 10 main categories eating out alcohol credit card interests clothes electricity cigarettes heating or AC unreturned items convenience and the lottery just think about that almost all of those items so pretty much discretionary that you directly control like eating at home versus going out to a restaurant don't order alcohol pay down credit card interest turn off the lights when you're not using them the list goes on but even if that's not your idea of fun and you want to be able to save money without changing really anything about your lifestyle then there is another option all you need to do is look at your most common expenses and then think to yourself how could I get the exact same thing for cheaper take car insurance for example be honest when is the last time you shopped around with 30 minutes of work I pretty much guarantee you could find the exact same coverage for less than you're currently paying from there take a look at your internet and cell phone bill there are so many different Alternatives right now that could save you a ton of money just apply this to everything that you spend money on and sometimes just calling up and asking for a discount is all it takes to begin cutting back it's also incredibly important to realize that when it comes to this step saving money is a lot more impactful than earning more let me explain when you earn a dollar you're going to have expenses like travel to and from work gas Insurance wear and tear on the car and taxes which could often leave you with about 75 cents left over when everything is said and done but when you save a dollar you get to keep that one dollar in full immediately and this is why saving money is so powerful to put that in context if you go out and spend fifty dollars on a meal you would have to earn 67 before tax to be able to pay for it"", ""and once you realize it it's life-changing not to mention being able to negotiate is probably one of the most important skills that you will ever learn in your entire life because this affects the trajectory of everything moving forward so in terms of how you could use these strategies to put you even further ahead there's one more aspect to this that you could use to your advantage and unfortunately most people don't even realize that they should be doing this although before we go into that even though we usually talk about taking care of your Investments I'll be honest from my experience I tend to do the best work and make the most amount of money when I eat better and exercise on a regular basis in fact for the last three months I've made it my goal to exercise for at least 30 minutes every single day and our sponsor co-pilot was able to make that a reality you start by answering a few quick questions about your goals and preferences and then from there you'll get matched with a personalized one-on-one Fitness coach who works around your schedule to craft the routine that's focused on consistency this includes a detailed onboarding call where you'll discuss your lifestyle nutrition and fitness goals and then from there you'll get access to Habit logging daily goals and in-app support directly from your coach for example I am really bad at making sure I drink enough water throughout the day so my coach was able to create a plan to keep me accountable to actually follow through which otherwise I probably wouldn't have done it plus with copilot no access to the gym is required you're able to get unlimited in-app text messages

guys so much and now let's get back to the video alright now in terms of getting one of the highest benefits from everything we've mentioned so far one of the most immediate things that you could begin doing right now is to either build or improve your credit score the fact is the credit history in your late teens and early 20s is going to help you tremendously in the future anytime that you want to buy a house get a car obtain a business loan and negotiate terms from the standpoints that you're a responsible borrower who's never missed a payment and plus it's incredibly easy but before we go into some of the tips to immediately improve your credit score I just want to get this out there that I was the one who learned all of these things the hard way point blank I grew up thinking that credit cards were bad that anyone who used them were irresponsible and as a result I just paid cash for everything little did I know that was complete backwards thinking and I didn't realize that until every single Bank denied me for getting a mortgage on my first property because I had zero credit history to be honest that experience taught me that we live in a world where your credit score matters a lot regardless of how much you make and save and if you want to effectively build your wealth while paying as little interest to the banks as possible it all comes down to this first go ahead and open up a free credit card with no annual fee second treat the credit card like it's an extension of your bank account and if you can't afford to buy something outright in cash you definitely can't afford to buy it on a credit card"", ""they either just make drastic lifestyle changes way too late or they just accept that they'll never be ahead financially which is not going to happen on my watch that's why my number one piece of advice for anyone between the ages of 18 and 35 is just to spend less money than you make i know this one might sound common sense to you and i but believe me it's not common sense to most people out there especially when you consider that forty percent of americans don't have enough in savings to cover a one thousand dollar emergency so the easiest way to get out of that trap is to cut back on your spending and get rid of any discretionary expenses that you might have also websites like mint.com and personalcapital.com are completely free and incredibly easy to use and believe me trust me when i say this the hardest part about doing all of this is just starting and just starting to turn this into a habit and a routine but once you start doing this the benefits are going to become monumental you're going to have extra money left over at the end of every single week and you're going to have disposable income left over that you can now go and invest with this step is really just about seeing the long term and realizing the opportunity that you have right now to begin investing as soon as possible these are really your prime savings years because you have the power of compound interest behind you so you may as well just take advantage of that while you still can i'm not sure if you can see ramsay here by the way but in the last video a lot of people were complaining that i wasn't giving ramsay enough pets so i'm going to give ramsay some pets here here you go and one of the tricks i often do when it comes to spending and saving money is i just think to myself if i don't go and buy something it's like i almost got paid not to buy it like for instance because i didn't go out and spend ten dollars on a hamburger on my drive home from work i just saved ten dollars which is kind of like i got paid an extra ten dollars not to spend it if that makes sense this way your brain almost starts to rewire itself and rewards you for not spending money because you act as though that is just money you got paid not to spend i don't know if that makes sense let me know if that hopefully makes sense now given that statistic about 40 of americans not being able to afford a thousand dollar emergency that has been fairly consistent among all the money related videos that i've seen where the subjects of the videos have gotten themselves into horrible credit card or student loan debt i've seen everything from tens of thousands of dollars in outstanding credit card bills to egregious student loan balances and otherwise just a lack of consideration for trying to pay those down as soon as possible and here's the thing i really believe that having any amount of unpaid consumer debt will grossly hinder your ability to build wealth in the future it's almost as though you're borrowing from tomorrow and the day after to go and pay for today if that makes sense so if at all possible avoid consumer debt at all costs use it only as a last case resort if something terrible happens and you just you need it to put food on the table or there's just no other option to turn to except for a credit card but do not make that a substitute for i can't afford to eating out with my friends every single night at nobu and malibu""]"

outperformed the stock market by almost 10 percent since 1965 to 2023 and that's why people affectionately call him the Oracle of Omaha he's kind of like the grandfatherly investor figure that we all wish we had and him and his partner Charlie Munger created a company called Berkshire Hathaway it's a massive corporation that invests into high quality companies companies like American Express Bank of America Kraft Heinz Coca-Cola and many others and today that company is the sixth most valuable company in the world with over 7 100 billion dollars in market cap and it also has the single most valuable stock in the world each share of Berkshire Hathaway is valued at almost half a million dollars basically like flexing with a reshard mill on your wrist but in stock form now some people also like to call Warren Buffett the king of passive income or the king of dividend investing because the companies he likes to buy tend to pay him dividends so many dividends in fact that just for context in 2022 the CEO of Apple Tim Cook made about a hundred million dollars for the entire year in compensation Berkshire Hathaway by comparison made 500 million dollars per month so Warren's company Berkshire Hathaway paid out in dividends five times in a single month with the CEO of Apple made throughout the entire year which is kind of insane to think about but also not a super fair comparison because Warren Buffett doesn't own a hundred percent of Berkshire Hathaway he owns about 15 so he made only 900 million dollars but still the point is he he's really smart and anytime he speaks people tend to listen and just this weekend they held Berkshire Hathaway's 59th annual shareholder meeting where anywhere between 40 to 50 000 people descended to Omaha Nebraska to watch him and Charlie Munger speak for five straight hours q a style and they covered everything from d dollarization in the end of the dollar the banking crisis the AI Revolution the stock market and its future their favorite stock and so much more so in today's video I want to share with you some of my favorite highlights from that five hour q a gold mine that most likely no one else watched but I did because I've got no friends but I do have you so let's get into it"", ""but throughout 2022 he's definitely up to the purchasing of Chevron pretty aggressively to where it's now more than a seven percent position in the US portfolio for Berkshire now in terms of Occidental the history is a little more complex and Buffett's history with oxy goes back to 2019 where Occidental Petroleum made an acquisition of another business called Anadarko Petroleum and Buffett actually helped oxy to finance that acquisition he purchased 10 billion in Occidental preferred stock which was going to pay him about 800 million million dollars a year in dividends through a combination of stock and cash and he also purchased warrants on about 83.9 million shares of Occidental a warrant is similar in many ways to an option although unlike an option a warrant is issued directly from the company in this case Occidental and those warrants if exercised would allow Buffett to purchase those 83.9 million shares at a stroke price of 59.62 cents per share which would represent about an eight percent stake in the company throughout 2022 we've seen Buffett continue to purchase Occidental in the open market he still yet to exercise those warrants and what the warrants aside he's been able to accumulate about a 20 ownership stake in the company and that has some interesting consequences it actually means that wind buffered buys stock and Occidental since he's such a large shareholder he now has to follow form four and we very quickly see these kind of new additions to Occidental from Buffett through these SEC filings and we actually had one as recently as the 28th of September which showed that he now owns 194.3 million shares or about 20 almost 21 of the company the other bit of news here that's notable worth Buffett and Occidental is that on the 19th of August the Federal Energy Regulatory committee uh granted Berkshire the right to buy up to 50 percent of Occidental in the open market and that follows a filing from Buffett and Berkshire on the 11th of July 2022 where they requested that permission and they basically argued that I'm buying a you know maximum 50 stake in Oxy wouldn't hurt competition or diminish regulatory Authority so we're now at a point where Buffett owns over 20 of Occidental that number gets very close to 30 percent if he would to exercise the warrants and he has permission to potentially buy up to 50 of the company in the open market so Buffett of course is known for being a very long-term investor he's also pretty well known for buying great businesses at a fair price so what on Earth is Buffett doing uh buying a couple of big oil companies presumably companies that won't be around in 50 or 100 years from today and companies that can have very volatile earnings as the price of oil moves up and down well I want to get into some of the supply demand Dynamics here for oil and there are definitely a lot of potential short-term catalysts in terms of things that might impact the price of oil we've got flowing effects from the Russia Ukraine situation we've got the depletion of the U.S strategic petroleum reserve and we're also starting to see some initial signs of things like kind of energy switching basically people going from natural gas to oil for you know heating purposes in Europe because natural gas prices have gone up substantially over the past 12 months now although I'm sure Buffett is well aware of all of those different Dynamics I really want to focus on the long-term trends for here because Buffett is a long-term investor and that is what's really going to matter for him with his you know potential success or lack thereof in Chevron and Occidental now of course uh oil and fossil fuels have become very much a dirty industry and it's very much in the interests of the world to you know switch away from fossil fuels over the long term"", ""hey guys in this video we are going over three stocks that Warren Buffett either already owns or would be proud to own I'll dive into the fundamentals and analysis of each of these companies and show you why they actually matched Warren Buffett's investing style make sure to watch all the way through to get an idea of why these stock picks could be very strong and also why they could be reliable growth socks that you can actually add into your own portfolio so we all know Warren Buffett the king of investors and probably one of the most influential people to ever live in the stock and investing world at 89 years old and with a net worth of about seventy billion dollars some would say that if there were a god of investing it would actually be him he's the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway which along with the terribly simple website fully owns companies such as Geico Fruit of the Loom Duracell and Dairy Queen and also owns a large percentage of companies like Kraft Heinz American Express Wells Fargo Apple and Bank of America he's known as a value investor preferring to invest long-term in companies with strong financials he's especially well known for actually investing in companies that are currently trading below their intrinsic value and holding them and building them until they actually reached their real value you're never gonna see Warren Buffett investing in companies like Tesla where speculation and potential future growth seem to outweigh all the shortcomings on their balance sheets and nothing used to be a large shareholders of the four largest US airlines he actually revealed as Lee's shareholders meaning that he had sold his entire position of US airline stocks he said that basically they just rarely sell portions of a company and if they do want to get out of an industry or a company they'll likely just sell all their shares and sell he did though he did end up losing a significant amount of money with the sale these airline financials just do not look promising to Warren Buffett and he thinks that even the current values of the stocks are not justified based on the numbers so here are some things that he actually swears by one is finding quality companies with a competitive advantage Warren Buffett hates buying companies that are not strong and he absolutely will not buy companies that do not have a competitive advantage which he actually calls a moat second is he says that you should invest like you're actually buying up the entire company now of course most of us in socks we can't afford to buy up a whole company so we're just purchasing individual shares however he says you should treat this like you are actually buying the company is it a good buy are you buying a discount or are you overpaying for the company so to do that you must also look at the book and intrinsic valuations third is you must invest in what you understand I think this is very important for a lot of investors because a lot of people just buy a stock based on its name without really knowing what the company does its current balance sheet and financials or the industry as a whole this really magnifies the importance of due diligence and that is doing your own research and coming up with your own conclusions and this fourth rule is keep cash on hand always have a good amount of cash available on hand in case investment opportunities do come yes some aggressive investors will actually not hold onto too much cash because they do want to leverage their money if you're holding onto cash that means the money is not currently invested and growing but of course there is a trade-off between risk and safety holding cash can definitely be a safer way to invest especially if you're keeping up to date with the markets and know what to invest in so let's go over three stocks that fit his criteria and I'll give you my opinions on each one as well as why you might want to add it to your own portfolio so number one is Apple AAPL Warren Buffett currently owns about 5.7 percent of Apple which equates to about seventy five billion dollars worth of shares this is his biggest holding in a company that he truly loves so currently Apple is trading at $299 and 42 cents with a 52-week low

watching the same levels and wondering the same thing caught a self-filling prophecy call whatever you want it can produce some very Dynamic level so the or excuse me Dynamic movement so let's keep this all In Color to make it hopefully easier to see we have this resistance Red Line we have the support green line and what was going on before this downwards pullback here well you had this big old explosion in the upwards Direction which is now allowed the ability to draw this bull flag pattern so while nothing is guaranteed is it valid is it possible to think that if the price can come up here and get a push up through the top part of that pattern that that break in and of itself could create additional buying pressure absolutely so again no guarantees but that certainly a plausible Dynamic especially when you start to sprinkle it sprinkle in that whole idea of self-fulfilling prophecies next one here utrs and this is no doubt about it ugly looking chart to think that at one point the price was all the way up here and now it's dropped and dropped and dropped but for you longer time viewers you've heard me say it again there can be opportunity in the ugly"", ""so if you start to see this zone break down let's give it a little bit of leeway let's go down to about 23 3 because there is confluence with that 34 ema as well that is that should be your line in the sand in my opinion i'm just moving that little bit up so you can see clearly if you do want to take a screenshot then feel free to do so so this is also your buy the dip zone this is your buy the dip zone around 23 000 any daily closers that happen under 23 000 would confirm that you've broken this main trend down which we came close to doing uh two days ago but you can see we wicked off of that so that was quite a scary time and consequently we're currently sort of facing the same situation so the bulls need to take charge of this very very quickly and they need to run this to the upside uh in the next couple of days probably even over this weekend if they want to continue their bullish momentum otherwise bears are going to take full control and this could get sent down and sent down quite hard that is so looking at this chart over here i just want to have a look at the emas and the momentum oscillators my main edges on the four hour chart you're again going to see that confluence coming in with the blue 200 ema which is sitting right now it's rising it's at 22 900 so again just round that up 23 000 is your main point of control 23 uh thousand to twenty three five on a four hour chart your higher low needs to be defended at twenty two eight so again for the sake of safety just round it up easy number to remember twenty three thousand is the number that you need to be focusing on and put in a price label in case someone wants to put a screenshot that's your your four-hour um higher low that needs to be defended and it should be okay momentum oscillators are coming down but if it manages to reset and and near the bottom while price gets to that level i am going to be a buyer i'm definitely buying this zone i'm buying 23 000."", ""but if you did hopefully remember me drawing in that trend line talking about the whole idea of self-fueling prophecies and wow did that happen today opening 30 minutes came up there broke through that level and then just a huge move in the upwards Direction so any of you that watched the previous video and caught that breakout big congratulations to you gonna go ahead and get rid of that line as it served its purpose now and we'll map out a couple of new levels in Dynamics and this next Dynamic still goes back to the whole idea of self-filling Prophecy so as I draw this please realize I'm not trying to impress you I'm not trying to imply this is a special skill that I have a lot of people have drawn the same exact uh dynamic as I've done right here and when I make this all this same color make it make pattern easier to see so we have our resistance we have our support we have the explosion upwards like that and then a few golfers will make a little bit more visual put a little golf hole down there this will be known as a bull pennant pattern so while nothing is guaranteed is it valid is it possible to think that because a bunch of people are watching this wondering the same thing that if the price comes up there and breaks up through it that that break in and of itself could create another round of buying even if it is just a self-filling prophecy that's not guaranteed but that certainly a plausible outcome so if you like bull pennants certainly keep an eye on this one next one here vstm absolutely monster move today and same general idea so I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on it because you just heard me say it but think back to patterns self-filling prophecies and a lot of people watching this so again no special skills here you got to think that a lot of people have drawn a line very similar to that and then at the same time drawn a line something very similar to that so let me change this to Green to represent the area of support and then again I'll just keep it all one color because I I can't help myself so again we have our resistance we have our support we have the explosion up right there we have our golfer down here so another bull pennant pattern I'd say the biggest difference here is that this one is a much cheaper stock so if you like stocks down below five dollars you like bull pennants here you go next one o-n-f-o""]"

about d5 protocols like yearn finance or hardware wallets like trezel you need to have substantial experience using these tools and a solid understanding of how they work you should also be familiar with the various regulations and lawsuits relevant to cryptocurrency most importantly you need to stay up to date with everything that's going on in the crypto space it's not enough to just flick open coin telegraph and lazily skim through the headlines either in addition to coin telegraph you should be looking at articles from other news sites like coindesk and decrypt on a daily basis and read through any headlines about important projects or topics given that almost all crypto news articles are in english i hope you're not surprised to know that english is another qualification you need to work in crypto i'm going to go ahead and assume that you can speak english if you're watching this video if you happen to speak a second language you're in luck because the demand for multilingual people in crypto is through the roof if you speak a quote rare language like bosnian tagalog or swahili even better if you have knowledge about crypto experience using crypto products keep up to date with the crypto news speak more than one language and have even a reasonable level of competency then you should have no issues finding employment in the crypto space unless you lack the third qualification solid communication skills like i said earlier the cryptocurrency industry is closely knit everyone knows everyone so you must be able to work well with others or at least not completely piss them off being friendly patient understanding and direct are invaluable skills in a fast-paced cryptocurrency workplace if you reckon you have good writing skills even better as you watch this video there are millions of people searching for information about cryptocurrency and the ability to explain the concepts they're searching for in a simple manner is quite literally worth millions of dollars finally some sort of previous work experience is always nice to have naturally the amount of work experience you need tends to increase with the caliber of the crypto company you're looking to work for as well as the seniority of the position itself that said the amount of work experience you need to work in crypto is usually next to nothing especially if you knock the other three qualifications out of the park crypto companies desperately need warm bodies to do the work and beggars can't be choosers so assuming you meet these core qualifications the next step is to find some crypto jobs and start applying there are currently about 4 000 crypto job openings not surprisingly most of these fall under the categories of software development law marketing human resources customer service and interestingly enough kyc verification the majority of these jobs can be done remotely and most pay much more than similar jobs outside of the crypto space case in point a recent job posting by staking rewards pays 75 000 us dollars per year to research new staking cryptocurrencies and maintain relationships with existing staking cryptos being tracked by their site i bet some of you watching this video do this for free in your spare time when it comes to finding these crypto jobs you have multiple options the first is to use dedicated cryptocurrency job boards like crypto.jobs cryptocurrencyjobs.com and"", ""[Music] before we get that bread i need to make sure you are not misled i am not a financial advisor and nothing in this video should be misconstrued as financial or investment advice though i also cannot guarantee that watching this video will land you a job in crypto i reckon it will help grease that groove remember it will be on you to take what you learn here and put it into action my name is guy and if this is your first time here it is a pleasure to meet you here at the coin bureau i do much more than give people guides on how to get involved with a great growth industry it's my mission to bring you the highest quality information about everything cryptocurrency coins tokens d5 protocols exchanges nfts and market analyses are just a few of the topics i discuss on the daily if this is the sort of content you need in your day then do us both a favor and hit up that subscribe button remember to ping that notification bell too since the youtube overlords are not always keen on promoting crypto content if you take a peek at the timeline below you'll see i've added a few timestamps feel free to use those to jump around if you're feeling feisty also if you're serious about working in the cryptocurrency space i recommend grabbing a pen and paper or opening up a digital note on your phone or computer to jot down a few bullet points if you'd rather just sit back and listen to my mellifluous tones then you can just copy and paste the bullet points i provided in the video description you're welcome now let's go job hunting the first step to getting a job in cryptocurrency is to ask yourself is this really the career path you want to take to be blunt working in the cryptocurrency space is not for everyone if you feel that you're on the fence in this regard allow me to detail what i believe to be the primary advantages and disadvantages to working in crypto for starters the cryptocurrency industry is extremely resilient to things like global pandemics this is because almost all crypto related jobs can be done remotely you could even go so far as to argue that the cryptocurrency industry thrives under these sorts of extreme conditions since a portion of the trillions of dollars in stimulus money being dished out by governments ends up in the crypto space and that means more crypto jobs are created the second advantage of working in crypto is that it's an industry that's still very much in its infancy this means that just like the cryptocurrency market early participants stand to reap incredible rewards the small close-knit nature of the crypto industry makes it very easy to move between employers and rise up the ranks once you get your foot in the door moreover the intense competition between crypto firms and their incredible demand for labor means that there is little room for any sort of employee discrimination or affirmative action policies if you can do a good job it doesn't matter what you look like what you believe or whatever combination of chromosomes you have some crypto companies don't even care about your credentials if you can reliably do the work this along with the network effects i just mentioned means you could very easily find yourself in an executive position at companies like binance and masari in just a few years time i reckon it would take you at least a decade and a hell of a lot of ass kissing to land a position like that at tech giants like google or facebook the third advantage of working in the crypto industry is that you'll never stop learning unchained podcast host laura shin previously worked at newsweek the wall street journal and new york times she quit all three jobs within three years and went full time into cryptocurrency because it was like quote turning over a multi-faceted intellectual gem you need to look no further than the videos on this channel to see that the amount of content in crypto is endless there are also new developments and topics coming to the forefront on an almost daily basis so if you want a job that's constantly changing engaging and challenging i can almost guarantee that you'll find it in the crypto industry that said keeping up with the fast pace of the crypto space is not for the faint of heart this brings me to the first disadvantage of working in crypto although the demand for labor in crypto makes it easy to move up the ranks it also means that you're going to be working your butt off to compensate for the constant shortage of employees in your department and you'll be expected to do the job better than the same employee at the crypto company you're competing against from time to time you're going to have to postpone doing other things you love to get the job done and during bull markets this may also require sacrificing sleep for days at a time to make matters worse there are no guarantees that you will still have a job once the bull market is over that's the second disadvantage of working in crypto your employment is fundamentally dependent on the same volatile assets that you hold on to for dear life assuming you do keep your crypto job well into the next bear market if governments around the world collectively decide to ban cryptocurrencies five or ten years from now by that point you may be so specialized in your particular niche that you'll have a hard time finding work outside of the crypto space so in short working in crypto is the same as hodling crypto it's all or nothing assuming you're ready to take the leap your next step is to find out if you meet the qualifications required to work in the crypto industry while the exact qualifications you need to work in cryptocurrency vary from job to job many of these are actually pretty universal the first is the most obvious and that's an in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrency along with any related topics and technologies as a rule of thumb the more you know about crypto the less the other qualifications are going to matter it just so happens that you can use the content on this channel and the articles on the coin bureau website to learn just about everything you need to know about crypto"", ""yes i'll leave links to those in the description those of you who have used jobs boards before will know that they tend to be a bit of a feeding frenzy by that i mean it's just hundreds of people spamming resumes to every open position and that means the likelihood of yours being noticed among the noise is pretty low although using a cryptocurrency job board is not necessarily a lost cause i strongly recommend going to the source specifically to the website of the crypto company offering that position this should theoretically increase the chances that your application will actually get read by the almighty gatekeeper if you don't see any jobs on these crypto jobs boards that you like or think you qualify for your next stop is the website of the crypto projects and crypto companies you know and love cryptocurrency exchanges like binance and coinbase are always hiring and they usually have their own dedicated jobs portals on their websites even us here at the coin bureau have our own jobs page link to that is in the description by the way if you're not sure if the crypto company you're interested in is hiring you can always reach out to them via twitter or telegram and ask them you might be surprised to find that they have a vacancy available and that you seem to be the right person for the job on that note if you are an active member of a cryptocurrency community you may already be on the cusp of clinching a crypto career as many of you will know the hottest crypto trend of 2020 was to become a decentralized autonomous organization even though most cryptocurrency projects transitioned to daos to sidestep any potential regulatory issues this simultaneously opened up some serious opportunities for the members of their communities this is because many dows have treasuries that are used to fund initiatives that are beneficial to their ecosystem if you're an active community member of a dow operated cryptocurrency you probably have the gravitas you would need to pass a proposal that would give you a part-time job while adding value to your favorite crypto project some community-run cryptocurrency projects like secret network even offer a path to what is essentially a career as a high-ranking community member if all else fails there's one last place you can check twitter there are a handful of twitter accounts that post cryptocurrency jobs as they're made available just enable account notifications on their twitter profiles and let that slow drip of crypto jobs come in i'll leave links to a couple of those in the description to wrap things up i want to give you a few tips to help you in your crypto career first tip trust your gut if you're just getting started in the crypto industry then chances are that you will get hired by a new crypto company that's also just getting started as you'll see not all these new crypto companies are entirely legit and some of them engage in some seriously shady practices what's more is that some of these new crypto companies are well funded which can give you the illusion that what they're doing is okay when you start wondering if you've accidentally stepped into the crypto underworld do not hesitate to go out and find another job second tip be personable and perceptive i really can't stress just how small the cryptocurrency space is you should do your best to be on good terms with your colleagues and actively engage with the other people who work in your crypto niche again be wary of any bad actors who drain your time and make you feel uncomfortable there's no shortage of scammers in cryptocurrency even at its highest levels you can learn more about common cryptocurrency scams by clicking up there in the top right of the video third tip consider becoming a freelancer for those who didn't know when you're a bona fider employee the company you work for usually has to shell out an ungodly amount of tax on any money they're paying you when you do that same job as a freelancer however they can write off the work you do as a business expense this means that instead of increasing their tax bill you're reducing it instead consequently the money that they pay you as a freelancer or contractor is often much more than the money they would have paid you as an employee the trade-off is that you have no job security no paid vacation and must also be responsible for paying your own tax even then the tax you pay will be minimal compared to the income you take home and you probably wouldn't be able to take much paid vacation anyways whilst we're in a bull market and then when the bull market ends any sort of job security you thought you had will probably go out of the window as a freelancer you can also leave at any time which can come in handy if you start to suspect the crypto company you're working for is actually a ponzi scheme whatever you do do not use websites like upwork to find work in the cryptocurrency space you'll be paid very little assuming you even land the gig just apply for a crypto job as you normally would and note in the application that you're willing to work as a contractor now this conveniently brings me to my fourth and final tip and that is to know your worth for the time being you do not have to compete with very many people to get a job in crypto this means that it's easy for you to become the undisputed master of your niche if you get hired somewhere hence why you're usually able to move up the ranks quickly in almost any crypto company once you get the sense that you've achieved some sort of mastery do not hesitate to demand what you believe to be fair compensation for your work again this will be much easier to do if you're a freelancer because any extra money you're requesting can be written off as a tax deductible expense by the crypto company you're working for trust me i've been there there are lots of pros to working in the cryptocurrency space in addition to being protected from global pandemics working in crypto means working in an industry that's growing just as exponentially as the coins and tokens it revolves around the constant developments lawsuits and drama guarantee that you'll never get bored either i can attest to that even though you're going to have to work your ass off could lose your job when the bull market ends i reckon the pros outweigh the cons after all it seems that you only get one shot at life and being on the cutting edge of the most disruptive technology in the world seems like a good way to spend that time the best part is the crypto world is yours for the taking there are literally thousands of crypto jobs just waiting to be filled and almost all of them require nothing more than some knowledge about crypto some experience with a few crypto products perhaps a few language skills and the ability to play nice with others there are plenty of crappy wage slave jobs with much higher barriers to entry and i certainly can't name a single regular job that doesn't demand at least one or two years of previous work experience it still blows my mind that some crypto jobs don't require any work experience whatsoever""]"

cryptocurrency market goes up to a certain amount if the market gets too hot and you decide that you want to pull your money out to be able to get some of your profits back these are kind of the simplest ways to kind of do it first up we have a coin base for those who do not know coin base is probably the largest cryptocurrency exchange that we have in the world right now they're also one of the most trusted they are the most not verified they have gone through all the legal hoops that they have to go through they're located in the United States but they still allow for international purchases and stuff like that as well they definitely handle people in the US if you are in the European Union and as well as if you are in the UK if I'm not mistaken a couple of days ago they also just added British pounds as well for people I know a couple of people in Europe who have also used coin base and they said that they had no issue at all I guess it has to be something on the lines of transfers I have not heard any complaints from people using coin base and people in the US should as well no coin base as well I recommend them simply because of how simple they are if you actually sign up and go through their website it's very basic there's nothing difficult about it everything is pretty much clear in your face like everything is kind of laid out it's nothing you won't be using coin base if you're trying to do something difficult or something that takes a lot of effort or something that you have to know technical skills about everything in on coin base is pretty much like there's an option for by there's also an option for sell there's an option for this is an option for that it's one of the easiest crypto places that I've ever seen in my entire life they've definitely done well to give you just exactly what you need and nothing more on the entire thing of coinbase they do have a verification process as many of these other things do if you have been in crypto for a while or if you are how do I say this if you were planning on taking out a significant amount of money if the market goes up or even right now depending on when you were trying to cash out the these websites have ways for you to verify your identity and it's usually through showing your passport showing a state ID or showing your country's ID sometimes you can also get in contact with them as

one hetera currently hedora is priced at around 5 cents with a market cap of just over 1.7 billion dollars what is hetera in simple terms hbar is a digital currency used to power transactions and operations within the hedora hashgraph ecosystem which focuses on offering an alternative to blockchain technology for creating fast secure and scalable decentralized Solutions why do I think hetera's price will explode unlike traditional blockchain platforms hetera hashgraph uses a unique consensus algorithm called hashgraph which aims to provide high throughput low latency and strong security but the main reason that I believe h-bar's price will explode is because it is ISO 222 compliant for those that don't know the iso 222 standard is the new protocol being adopted by the international financial industry due to h-bar's Advanced and patented technology it sticks out in the crypto market and could be one of the best cryptocurrencies for financial services hetera's price targets and predictions hbar has previously hit all-time highs of 56 cents but the crypto had a lower Supply so the market calf didn't need to be as high but now there is a bigger supply the token will need a higher market cap to get to 56 cents but h-bar is a great cryptocurrency and I believe it will get to a 10 billion dollar market cap this would give the crypto a price of 31 cents using the crypto

home like one of these new construction neighborhoods or whatever somebody fully remodels it with like Brazilian hardwood expensive tiling this that or the other the next buyer comes in get all that crap for a discount the same is true with cars and boats that is the passive income hack $300 for the used car six hundred twenty eight dollars for the lease version or $800 for the bought car the difference we could even throw in maybe a hundred or two hundred dollars from maintenance or whatever because you're not gonna have one of those protection plans unless you bought one then it'll cost you that money whatever big deal so let's say the used cars gonna cost you out of $450 a month there's still a difference of about a hundred seventy eight dollars to three hundred seventy eight

yourself of nutrients make sure you're getting good food in your body and that is very important now the next one is with shelter the cost of shelter is difficult to avoid that one one of the best ways to cut your cost of your apartment or house in half is to get a roommate or consider renting out a room in your home through something like airbnb to cut the cost of living for yourself literally in half now there's also some other ways you can go about this if you're not interested in getting a roommate or you already have a roommate you could consider cutting some utility costs like for example wi-fi or electrical there's ways to actually cut these costs and so most people think that there's only one electrical provider or one wi-fi provider when really you could look into various companies that are offering similar products and shop around a little bit more and just because you've been using the same provider for the past 10 years doesn't mean that you shouldn't look into getting a different one because what happens and and this happens with other utilities as well so for example waste management trash companies for example will jack up the price over time without people really realizing until you look and you say wait a minute this bill is three times higher than your competition so you switch to the competition so make the year on make sure that you're on top of that switching to various different providers for various utilities to get the most effective use of your money number three is transportation now this is one that is very difficult to avoid as well but the bureau of labor statistics estimates that the average cost of operating and owning a vehicle is close to about nine thousand dollars per year i'll leave a link to that down below because i was kind of taken aback when i read that at first but the cost of owning and operating a vehicle is very expensive especially if you're racking up a lot of miles on it people don't always consider this look you're paying for auto insurance you're paying for uh the vehicle expenses you're paying for gas you're paying for all these different issues that might pop up with the vehicle you need new tires you need to get it inspected you need to get a new alternator and it runs up a lot of money so look if you live in an urban or even a suburban area where there's some type of public transportation or even uber sometimes you might want to consider thinking whether or not it's actually worth it for you to own a vehicle and how much you're using that vehicle versus something like public transportation run those numbers i highly suggest that because cars are a money pit they're difficult to avoid especially if you're in rural areas like myself it's difficult to not have a vehicle i did it for a while but eventually i had to end up getting a vehicle but look if you can cut back those it's going to help you so much now there's two more here that are very essential clothing this is one that's very easy to cut back on the best way to cut back on the cost of clothing uh what i found is to unsubscribe from all these different emails from clothing providers uh they're giving you sales and discounts and it's it's look email marketers are paid to do something uh that they're very good at and they're very effective at it that's why they're still making money and they're still sending these emails because they're effective look when you're getting those emails where it says 40 off sale of this clothing store people end up buying clothes so what i do i unsubscribed from all of those different uh email providers and and emails that i was getting and that way i wasn't tempted to go out and buy something because i got an email about a special sale on something that i didn't really need or want but ended up buying so unsubscribe from those emails and if you're really pinching pennies if you're really in a kind of an area where you need to start saving more money you're on a tight budget i would consider going to something like a thrift store or goodwill or salvation army if you need to go to that there's no shame in that look i've done it in

bottle of alcohol so the average bottle service in las vegas ranges from 350 to 600 dollars you're paying over a thousand percent more for that bottle of alcohol just to drink it in front of people however let's take this a step further if you go to the hakasan nightclub in las vegas and order the armand de brignac dynasty collection you will be paying five hundred thousand dollars for bottle service i'm not kidding you just to put this in perspective it costs about thirty thousand dollars to build a school in a third world country so instead of spending half a million dollars on bottle service you could open sixteen schools in developing countries and still have twenty thousand dollars left over ordering bottle service is one thing you should never do with your money and the third and final thing you should never do with your money and this is a mistake i made myself is buying an expensive car guys i lost almost ten thousand dollars on a car over the course of one year because i made the mistake of buying an expensive car the thing is americans are obsessed with cars especially young people like myself and this is a financial trap that you need to avoid many of us see cars as a status symbol an expensive car is a temporary escape from our financial reality or a depreciating liability whichever one you want to look at in fact the average car payment in the united states is now 503 dollars per month so 49 of americans are paycheck to paycheck meanwhile the average person is spending over 500 a month to drive a car does that make any sense to you i think that many of us have lost touch with what a car actually is a car is a method of transportation here are two people who work for the same employer one person drives a ten-year-old economy car that is paid off so his car payment is zero dollars a month the other person drives a brand new luxury car and his car payment is six hundred dollars a month both people are able to get to their job at the same time because a car is a method of transportation spending six hundred dollars a month on the car does not help you earn any more money they both get to the job and they both make the same amount of money a car is a method of transportation i truly believe this is the number one problem with society we buy things we don't need with money we don't have to impress people we don't like and i don't want you

22,21,78,21_retire_retirement_age_net worth,"['retire', 'retirement', 'age', 'net worth', 'social security', 'save', 'worth', 'net', 'expenses', '401k']","[""but before you get discouraged just remember that this number is pulled up significantly by a few people who make a lot of money like The Stranger Things cast to earn an estimated nine and a half million dollar paycheck or the top one percent in this age who have a net worth of 435 thousand dollars because of that the median net worth in this age bracket is 8 216 dollars likely because most people of this age are either still in school just beginning their career or just starting to save not to mention if you went to college the average student loan debt is 37 574 dollars so it wouldn't even be uncommon at this age to have a negative net worth simply because you had very little to begin with that's why if you want to put yourself ahead and make sure you're on track to doing everything you want to do throughout your 30s and 40s here's what I recommend first go and get yourself a credit card with no annual fee the point of this is to begin building your credit history and since 50 percent of that score is based on your on-time payment history and how long you've had the card open for the sooner you start on this the better second make sure you open up a Roth IRA or contribute to a 401k these are both tax advantaged accounts that you would be able to set up yourself or through an employer and then from there you'd be able to invest your money much more efficiently doing this is incredibly easy it'll probably take you about 20 minutes and ideally you should aim to save anywhere between 10 to 20 percent of your income the third try to have between two to six months worth of your expenses saved up in cash this is meant to be like your emergency fund so you can have something to fall back in case you need it"", ""and I promise you once you start you're not going to want to stop not to mention you could use the link in the description in our sponsorpublic.com we'll be giving you a free stock worth all the way up to a thousand dollars when you make a deposit with the code gram so hopefully that should at least give you a bit of a head start all right now from the age of 25 to 29 there really aren't that many changes with an average net worth of forty nine thousand three hundred and eighty seven dollars except it's worth noting that the median net worth in this category actually went down to 7 500 and 11 likely because this is the age you begin moving out on your own getting adult responsibilities stop having fun and having to pay your own cell phone bill however if you're in the top one percent in this category you're going to see your net worth increase to 606 188.36 to be honest at this age your priority should really be about finding a good long-term career building to your strengths and maximizing your income to be able to save as much money as possible ideally you should also be tracking your expenses keeping a budget and understanding how much you're going to need saved and invested in order to retire I know it could sound really boring to start thinking about right now but the truth is when it comes to investing starting in your 20s could put you so much further ahead by the time that you're older just consider this if you want to have one and a half billion dollars invested by the age of 65 you could do that by investing 416 dollars a month beginning at the age of 25 at an average of an 8 return however if you procrastinate and don't get started until the age of 35 you would need to invest almost a thousand dollars a month to reach that exact same goal so if the choice is yours save 416 dollars now or a thousand dollars a month later speaking of your 30s though this is the age where you'll really begin to see the biggest differences for example the media net worth of those aged 30 to 34 is 35 000 the average is a hundred and twenty two thousand dollars and if you want to be in the top one percent of this category you need to be worth about a million dollars although if you thought that was a lot just wait if we look at the exact same category for those aged 35 to 39 the media net worth jumps to fifty five thousand dollars the average more than doubles to two hundred and seventy four thousand dollars and the top one percent have a net worth of more than four million dollars so what just happened well most likely this is the time your income and career really begin picking up this could also be the point where some people are fortunate to exit their business benefit from an IPO or have a few very well-timed Investments that bump up the top one percent although in terms of actionable steps that you could take throughout your 30s to dramatically increase your net worth here's what I would recommend first aim to completely get rid of any bad debt this means you paid off any loans above a six to seven percent interest rate you don't have any outstanding credit card debt or personal loans and besides the possibility of a mortgage you have nothing else weighing you down the second you should try to save at least twenty percent of your income my personal approach with this that's worked really well for me is that anytime I make more money I just pretend that money doesn't exist"", ""when it comes to this the blog Mr Money Mustache has the perfect chart that shows you exactly how much you'll have to save in order to retire for example someone who saves 10 of their income would be able to retire after 51 years will someone saving forty percent could retire into 22 years by viewing everything from this perspective it'll give you a much greater understanding in terms of exactly how much you'll need to save and for how long now by the time you're in your 40s things really begin to speed up the median net worth between 40 and 49 is 164 000 the average is 761 000 and if you want to be in the top one percent that'll be about ten and a half million dollars interestingly enough though one of the biggest drivers of net worth in your 40s isn't necessarily your savings your income or your expenses but instead your home that means that at this age buying a home is one of the largest factors that positively affects your net worth likely because a mortgage forces you to automatically build equity every month and in general homes tend to go up in value of course you could also argue that those who have a higher income and more financial literacy are more likely to buy a home to begin with which skews the data but either way at this age number one you should consider buying a home now this one's certainly not required but buying a home is going to give you a lot more stability in the sense that you're not going to have to worry about your living situation in retirement what's paid off you're not going to be at the whims of a landlord and values over time have generally gone up in value depending on where you're buying the second if possible you should also max out your retirement accounts interestingly enough your 40s also coincide with what's called your Peak earning years meaning you've built up enough experience and momentum to command a significantly higher salary so ideally if you're interested in retiring before the age of 65 you should be working to max out your Roth IRA and your 401k to make sure you're on track and finally third if possible aim to have between five and seven years of your expenses saved up that's because for a 30-year retirement you're going to have to have between 25 and 33 times your annual spending invested in order for that money not to run out and in your 40s this is the number you should really be focusing on not necessarily your net worth but then from there we have your 50s with a median net worth of 171 thousand dollars an average net worth of one million one hundred and sixty five thousand dollars and a top one percent Network worth of 17 million five hundred and forty five thousand dollars by this age most experts recommend that you have anywhere between five to seven times your annual salary saved up and invested in order to be on track to retire which means the median person is very much behind and has a lot of catching up to do just consider this it was found that the average person spends fifty thousand dollars a year in retirement which works out to be forty one hundred and twenty eight dollars a month so with an average Social Security payment coming in at twenty four hundred and eighty four dollars a month that means you'll need to bring in a monthly income of sixteen hundred and forty four dollars to bridge the difference assuming no major health complications no social security issues and no unexpected life events that means following the four percent rule which suggests that you could spend four percent of your portfolio every single year without running out you would need five hundred thousand dollars invested not including the value of your house car or anything else that isn't producing an income that's why first you should absolutely track your expenses this will give you a a better understanding in terms of how much you'll need in retirement and will give you a blueprint to how much you'll need to save to get there this might also include moving to a cheaper location cutting back in your expenses or doing anything else that you can to plan for a time that you may no longer be working and second depending on your situation you should be about halfway through or very close to paying off your mortgage hopefully when that happens it'll reduce your expenses dramatically and give you a lot of peace of mind that no matter what happens you have a home that's completely paid off now remember that doesn't mean that you can't work or make money at all in retirement but it is about giving you the option of not working whether that be voluntary or out of necessity and finally we have the net worth in your 60s which is where the numbers begin to Peak as you could see the median net worth is 271 thousand dollars the average is 1.25 million dollars and if you want to be in the top one percent it's a net worth of 16.4 million surprisingly everything from this point on is kind of downhill for example every age bracket afterwards from median average and top 1 percent declines likely as they begin working less and spending down their money however a few things in this age bracket will begin to happen""]"

know next down the line that's the backlog appraise under false pretenses that somebody's actually uh uh you know buying a home after someone else at the similar valuation that's scary so you get some

all of the alerts for that uh coming up probably this week here in the stocks and psychology money group so stay tuned for that"", ""Los Angeles residents will be subject to an additional four to five and a half percent tax on all properties sold over 5 million dollars and this is expected to completely destroy the high-end property Market throughout the entire State potentially resulting in even more people leaving so here's the deal most dates of what's known as a transfer tax usually paid by the seller anytime a property changes ownership in Los Angeles the transfer tax was about 0.45 of the sales price with money usually going back into the county but that was until of course measure Ula went into effect this is a new plan that was established to fund affordable housing and provide resources for the homeless by enacting a four to five and a half percent tax on the sales price of every property sold over five million and the long-term effects of this are said to be disastrous of course for those unaware is a bit of a background homelessness is a serious issue throughout California which is occupied by more than half of all unsheltered people in the country in fact California spent 10 billion dollars between 2018 and 2021 trying to solve the issue but the number of those living on the streets continued to rise despite California soon becoming the fourth largest economy in the world in this case though a four to five and a half percent transfer tax is expected to raise 672 million dollars for affordable housing and it's not just applicable to Los Angeles the problem though comes with the fact that California's one percent currently pay more than half of the State's income tax and as of lately a lot of them are leaving and that's a huge problem the CEO of the California taxpayer Association even said that the top five percent of income earners pay 70 percent of the personal income tax so if even a few of those taxpayer is rethink California as a place to live that does have an impact in the state budget in terms of the housing market though even though people hear Mansion tax and assume that it only applies to A-list actors athletes and hedge fund managers in reality it's mainly going to affect the construction of multi-family and commercial buildings because of five percent tax and the entire amount can often equate to more than half of a builder's overall profit margin this means that there's even less incentive now for investors to add more housing Supply into the market businesses will be less inclined to expand and this only gives more of a reason for people to leave on top of that it said that the new tax would apply to the entirety of the sale consideration not solely the amount in excess of the five or ten million dollar thresholds and regardless of whether the property is sold at a gain or a loss this means that a property that sells for four million 999 999 dollars will not have to pay the additional tax while a property that sells for one dollar more will have to pay a 225 thousand dollar fee it just makes no sense personally I think this measure affects the entirety of California because even though this currently only applies to the largest cities the expectation is that the dollar amount could very well be lowered and there's nothing stopping them from applying this throughout the entire State on top of that to me there's really no logic in applying the tax to the entire amount it would be no different than the IRS saying if you make more than forty four thousand seven hundred and twenty six dollars all of your income will be taxed at 22 percent no tax system works like that and generally it's only the tax above that amount that applies not the whole amount I see this unfortunately as a misguided attempt to solve a problem by simply throwing more money at it versus solving the core issue which in my opinion is a former resident of California is simply a lack of accountability throughout all Statewide spending kind of like spending a hundred billion dollars on a high-speed rail that went nowhere If instead California spent more money prioritizing mental health or addiction I think they go lot further than raising taxes on people who are more likely to leave but speaking of that there is another topic that's most likely going to have a direct impact on you and that's what brings us to a brand new proposal to raise taxes let me explain as it stands right now the United States is quickly running out of money with the national debt approaching 32 trillion dollars now typically this isn't much of a concern when interest rates are low and you could pretty much borrow as much money as you wanted to for free but now with rapidly Rising rates the United States is beginning to pay a lot more in interest roughly a trillion dollars a year to be exact and that's a problem especially when costs are only expected to go higher so as a way to pay for the national debt a new proposal would cut the deficit by three trillion dollars over the next 10 years and most likely it's going to have an effect on you in one way or another first this would increase the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 raising 1.3 trillion dollars as they say this would still be lower than the 35 tax that was established before the 2 2017 tax cuts and jobs act but it would ensure that companies pay their fair share at a slightly higher tax rate than what we're currently seeing in terms of the potential repercussions of this a tax Foundation analysis found that a 28 corporate tax rate would reduce GDP by 0.7 percent or 160 billion dollars stocks and wages would marginally decline and 138 000 full-time jobs be lost thankfully they believe the loss would be gradual but it could result in a GDP decline of 720 billion dollars over the next 10 years which is larger than the tax revenue that would be generated in its place as a result they believe that long-term higher corporate tax would result in incomes dropping by one and a half to two percent so overall as far as I think about all of this 28 tax is probably not the most effective at generating Revenue"", ""and it's already causing the cost of gas per gallon to go up 15 cents from the month before now the real bad news though is the price of rent a whole bunch of people a wave of people who may have bought a house are now forced to keep renting because of all the pressure on the market right now those renters don't have a lot of options and they do have more tensions with their landlords many say the rent is too damn high and experts say it's in part due to the high cost of buying a home rent is becoming a huge problem for a couple reasons the latest data from Redfin shows even though the median home sale price is down 2.1 percent this year in comparison to last year housing payments are actually up in insanely High almost 15 percent combine all of that with the still low inventory levels and the tighter lending standards and that just means that people need higher credit scores higher down payments and higher incomes and that means people are forced to go back to renting only to then find out that rent is becoming that much more expensive nationally rent is more than 20 percent higher than the start of 2020 according to Redfin over 8 million Americans are behind on rent and 2.3 million experienced a rent increase of more than 500 in the last 12 months according to U.S census data released late last month the typical application fee is now anywhere from twenty to a hundred dollars just to apply for rent according to Redfin now it's not all that data here's one major reason why real estate is becoming more unaffordable that's a lot less talked about private Equity firms private Equity firms raise money from institutional and accredited investors so not just from any ordinary person those funds are then invested in different types of assets with the aim of getting a return on investment according to Americans for financial reform 1.6 million families rented from Real Estate owned by private Equity firms that includes over one million apartment units over 275 000 home lots and nearly two hundred and forty thousand single-family rental homes so there's no doubt that people are forced to compete with private equity in some markets and that's not helping homes become affordable but besides residential real estate there's also a massive problem with commercial real estate FDIC insured Bank hold the largest share of cre mortgages at 39 or 1.7 trillion dollars thirteen percent is held in cmbs and most is held at Regional and Community Banks now this year and next there is a huge pipeline of commercial mortgages hitting maturity that need to be refinanced refinancing those spaces will be really hard because interest rates have doubled over the last two years which will make those loans so much more expensive now I've talked about this problem in my last video but the problem is getting worse small Banks were actually the largest holders of retail spaces at 46 percent and 30 percent of office spaces property owners who need to refi are up against higher borrowing costs and lower property values Mark Grant Chief Global strategist at Collier security says everybody's scaling back their risk appetite for real estate loans office owners in particular are getting squeezed 40 billion dollars worth of these properties are now seen in distress but now those smaller banks are under pressure thanks to the banking crisis and the vacancies are going up and that's mostly happening because after the pandemic people chose to do hybrid work or work from home and now there's less of a need for businesses to own those commercial buildings in the first place and that's why the amount of office space for lease has been going up and it's estimated that by the end of the decade the majority of office spaces will be vacant prices are estimated to Fall by as much as 40 percent in commercial real estate if things continue the way they are right now now because Banks understand everything I just shared with you in this video Banks tend to become protective and defensive in this type of an economy and that's why the next big worry is something called a credit crunch events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses which would in turn affect economic outcomes a credit crunch happens when Banks stop lending as much money as they used to and this makes it harder for people to get a loan to buy a home and it makes it harder for businesses to operate and pay their employees and this is happening today small business bankruptcies are on the rise and we're seeing more today than we did at the height of the pandemic and the unique data that we have from UBS evidence lab suggests that these filings are up to a rate of about eight per week I think that the underlying message is that there is weakness in the SME sector the SME sector by the way refers to small and mid-sized Enterprises and it's companies that usually have less than 500 employees and make less than 100 million dollars in annual gross sales per year now these types of businesses according to the World Bank organization make up over 90 percent of the economy and over 50 percent of the workforce around the world now for the US in 2020 these companies made up 99 of the US economy and 47.1 percent of the U.S Workforce these types of companies are the lifeblood of the economy and a credit crunch would severely hurt them because they also have what's called floating rate debt which means any time they have to refinance their loans if interest rates are higher that puts a huge amount of pressure on them and it makes it that much more expensive and because people have pulled their money out of the smaller Regional banks that also means those banks have less liquidity to then lend that money out this makes those Banks more conservative and more defensive which leads to even less lending which eventually slows economic growth which translates to higher unemployment and we're already starting to see that happen outside of just the tech sector now of course this is a crisis that we should take seriously but it's also something that may never happen and this is because the government could step in and allow those companies to make interest-only payments on their loans and believe it or not this is already a thing in residential real estate you can apply for a mortgage interest only payment and your monthly payments for your house are going to be a lot lower but the trade-off is you're never gonna own the house some people call that renting but the banks call it you'll own nothing and be happy now since I'm an optimist I tend to believe that Banks don't want to repossess the commercial property because they don't want the liability they don't want to lose the money and the government doesn't want small businesses to go into a depression so more than likely the FED will have to step in and do something about all this and that brings us to interest rates now no one knows exactly what will happen to those interest rates because we don't live inside the mind of Jerome Powell but the stock market makes its own prediction every single day on what it thinks will happen on May 3rd that's the next time we'll hear about what happens to interest rates now there's actually two ways you can check yourself right now on what might happen and the first is my favorite method and it's called the CME fed watch tool the way to read this chart is to look at the current Target rate which is 4.75 to 5 now on the left you'll see a probability right now it shows 34.1 percent that the target rate on stay the exact same as it is right now on the right though it shows us a 65.9 percent chance that the FED will raise the target rate to between 5 and 5.25 percent which is a difference of a quarter percent from the current rate so that's the tool I use to tell you that come May 3rd most likely the Federal Reserve will increase the interest rates by 0.25 percent and hopefully that'll be the ceiling but we'll see that's all the short-term way to tell now the long-term way to tell is a little less reliable""]"

and a beta of 1.04 so to start off you know veg has a really high upside potential due to it being a growth etf with holdings from the largest companies like apple and amazon these big companies are relatively stable which should minimize your risk as an investor especially if you want low cost for a long-term investment and i think that a lot of these big companies could be undervalued right now with the recent drops meaning that now is a better time to get in than one or two months ago with one of the lowest expense ratios on the list at 0.04 percent an average annual return of 11 you'd end up with over 200 000 if you were to invest a hundred dollars per month for 30 years this is definitely one of the more popular high growth etfs that a lot of investors love number five on our list is the invesco qqq trust stock ticker qqq this is an etf that tracks stocks in the nasdaq 100 index the etf specifically focuses on companies that are leaders in the long term transformative trends such as augmented reality cloud computing streaming services electric vehicles and more right now one share of invesco qqq is trading at 351.49 with a 52-week low of 307.39 and a 52-week high of 408.71 cents they have net assets of 215.24 billion dollars average yield of 0.46 and an expense ratio of 0.2 percent taking a look at the one-year price chart we can see that one year ago we were sitting at about 310 a share it grew really rapidly in 2021 all the way up to highs of over 400 and since the start of 2020 we have seen a very big correction with of course another a small jump very recently it's categorized as a large growth etf with unfortunately a year-to-date daily total return of negative 18.6 some of the biggest sectors are going to be in consumer cyclical consumer defensive healthcare communication services and technology being the largest at 45.71 we have an average price earnings ratio of 33.89 average price to book ratio of 8.93 and average price sales ratio of 4.61 like i said already we have a negative year-to-date daily total return but if we take a look at the one-year daily total return we can see that that is actually 8.41 and the three-year daily total return is a very high 24.47 percent the annual total return history shows a lot of green bars with growth as high as 54.45 in 2009 but of course in 2008 we saw that huge negative 41.68 return as far as the risk statistics we have an alpha of 7.8 and a beta of 1.02 so since 1999 qqq has demonstrated a history of outstanding performance consistently beating the S&P500 index i think that because of their big exposure to big technology companies that are leading the race in transformative long-term themes we should continue to see a lot of growth over the next decade kikuku also has a pretty low expense ratio of 0.2 percent it's not as low as some of the other ones but in the grand scheme of things it's not too bad and like i mentioned earlier their daily total return for the last three years is about 24 which is very very strong and they even have a dividend yield of about 0.57 percent overall this etf stands to gain in the long term due to the largest companies being in the best position to survive times of financial struggle like the last market downturn that was caused by the pandemic"", ""and yeah at the end of the day investing takes a lot of emotional strength but because sphd is specifically designed to minimize volatility it makes for a great investment for many people that want something easy to stick with okay next on the list is sdiv which is the global X super dead than

30.87 and a pretty high expense ratio of 0.58 if you take a one year price chart you can see the performance has not been good we went from over 13 a share to just under eight dollars per share which

now because they invest in equities all around the world your investment is Diversified in terms of geographic location and interest rates globally everyone knows that inflation rates in the country are experiencing record highs and so this ETF is great for people that want to diversify away from the rising inflation and interest rates in the US sdiv also has a great track record in terms of paying out dividends to shareholders as they've made monthly payments to investors for over 10 years they're able to pay out a good amount in dividends because of their smart beta stock strategy where they try to outperform the market through a set of higher risk higher return rules these rules are used to determine what investments should be included in the portfolio now this differs from the traditional method of tracking stocks through market cap as this ETF tracks stocks through their market cap as well as their dividend yield now this may sound risky but again the Holdings are spread out across different sectors of the world balancing out the non-traditional stock strategies used within this ETF this could be a great strategy for people that are trying to significantly beat interest rates through high income potential coupled with a high dividend yield all in all another saw all ETF with high paying dividends that you should consider investing into and number two we have

for example we further shrink the universe by isolating the top shareholder yield stocks registering higher debt retirement with low financial leverage those are both quality metrics we also seek to avoid value traps by doing a final sort based on momentum indicators it can be an exhausting process but we believe it's worth it as results speak for themselves as we wrap up yes this is a

covered the U.S equities Market but when you really get into it that's just the tip of the iceberg so an international Index Fund covers everything else outside of it from Emerging Markets Europe the Pacific the Middle East North America plus some of the largest Holdings are the companies that we use day to day like Nestle semiconductors Samsung Toyota and so much more the advantage here is that as other countries grown develop through stock prices increase and your Investments do better but there is a bit of a catch over the last 10 years International index funds have remained fairly flat and throughout the last two decades the United States Market has outperformed just about everything else out there although just keep in mind that that isn't always guaranteed to happen throughout history there have been multiple times at International markets have outperformed the United States like throughout most of the 1980s and 2000s and there's certainly a chance that that could happen again especially if we could be seeing a 2020 three recession now in this case something like VT sax has only returned 3.2 percent since its Inception in 2010 which sure is very disappointing when you compare that to something like the S&P500 but it'll pay you a dividend to roughly 3.64 so that means for every ten thousand dollars you invest you'll get 364 dollars in passive income of course just like the others Vanguard does have a three thousand dollar minimum and because International stocks take a little bit more to facilitate there is a higher expense ratio of 0.11"", ""hi i'm kate from the motley fool i'm going to explain what you should know about etfs how they work and how to buy them an exchange traded fund or etf allows investors to buy many stocks or bonds at once investors buy shares of etfs and the money is used to invest according to a certain objective for example if you buy an smp 500 etf your money will be invested in the 500 companies in that index one common question is how do etfs and mutual funds differ since the basic principle is the same the key difference between these two investment vehicles is how you buy and sell them mutual funds are priced once per day and you typically invest a set dollar amount mutual funds can be purchased through a brokerage or directly from the issuer but the key point is that the transaction is not instantaneous on the other hand etfs trade just like stocks on major exchanges such as the new york stock exchange or nasdaq instead of investing a set dollar amount you choose how many shares you want to purchase because they trade like stocks etf prices continuously fluctuate throughout the trading day and you can buy shares of etfs whenever the stock market is open but before we get into the details there are a few concepts you need to know before you buy an etf passive vs active etfs there are two basic types of etfs passive etfs also known as index funds simply track a stock index such as the S&P500 active etfs hire portfolio managers to invest their money the key takeaway passive etfs want to match an index performance active etfs want to beat an index performance expense ratios etfs charge fees known as expense ratios you'll see the expense ratio listed as an annual percentage for instance a one percent expense ratio means that you'll pay ten dollars in fees for every one thousand you invest so a lower expense ratio will save you money dividends and drips most etfs pay dividends you can either choose to have your dividends paid to you in cash or have them automatically reinvested through a dividend reinvestment plan or drip now let's talk about the taxes in an etf if you buy etfs in a standard brokerage account not an ira you should know they could result in taxable income any gains you make from selling an etf will be taxed according to capital gains tax rules and any dividends you receive will likely be taxable as well of course"", ""so it's easier than ever to start investing but there's a couple of things you should consider before choosing your brokerage account to name a few what fees or commission do they charge do they offer automated investments do they offer fractional shares or do you have to buy a whole stock how is their application and website usability this account will be your gateway to investing it's important to research which brokerage account matches your investment style whatever you invest in we advocate for a long-term focus it is possible to make money in the short term on the stock market if you're very lucky however at the motley fool we believe in a diverse portfolio and long-term growth to see the best overall returns okay let's go shopping the stock market the place where you can buy and sell stocks the stock market is open monday to friday 9 30 am to 4 p.m eastern standard time i want to break down the types of investments into two categories active and passive active investing requires a hands-on approach typically by a portfolio manager or yourself passive investing involves buying into a curated grouping of companies or securities let's start with active an individual stock a stock represents a piece of ownership in a company or a share by owning stock in a company you are a part owner of that business you have stake in the business's success now and in the company's future for as long as you continue to own your shares mutual funds a mutual fund is a professionally managed investment fund that pools money together for many investors to purchase securities because these often involve a manager actively making investments on your behalf you'll want to watch out for steep fees now passive the prime example of a passive approach is to buy an index that follows something like the S&P500 index fund an index fund tracks an index or a defined collection of stocks these could be well-known groupings of stocks like the S&P500 500 of the largest companies in the stock market or simpler groupings of stocks with a certain sector like tech stocks or health care stocks this is a super easy way to diversify you aren't putting all your money on one company that way it's a less risky option if one company doesn't perform well etf most often exchange traded funds operate as index funds easily tracking large groups of stocks the special distinction as an etf simply means you can trade these in the stock market the same way you would in individual stock reits or a real estate investment trust is a company that owns and in most cases operates income producing real estate reits own many types of commercial real estate ranging from office and apartment buildings to warehouses hospitals shopping centers hotels and commercial forests you did it made it to the end hopefully you learned a lot from this video and feel more comfortable taking the first steps to invest into the stock market often a lot of people make investing into the stock market more difficult than it needs to be at the

analysis of what is remaining and what am i kind of getting for my 5.50 and what he found was that in his view curate slash qvc was trading at about only three or four years worth of free cash flow so a very very cheap stock assuming the business didn't just deteriorate rapidly over the next few years so in his words he really only had to be right for three years and that was a bit that he was comfortable making with a large chunk of his portfolio and that too for me has always been one of the attractions to sort of the deep value style of investment so uh looking at these weird little beat up companies trading at very low pml multiples um is the fact that you can sometimes buy some of these things for three or four or five times earnings and uh assuming that the earnings aren't going to fall off a cliff and that frankly is the sole job of you as an investment analyst to try and figure out whether you think that's going to happen if you're investing in one of these companies um if you can get yourself into a situation where the multiples are cheap you think that's probably not going to happen in terms of this big drop off in earnings uh you can bet really big because you only have to be right for a short period of time because you're getting your money back in three or four or five years if it's trading at that sort of multiple and when you sort of compare that to uh some of the more high growth stocks that are trading at very high multiples um that is a situation where you have to really be right for a longer period of time so if you go and buy a company trading at 30 times earnings you have to be right for maybe 15 or 20 years assuming that it continues to grow if you're not right and it never grows you're going to get your money back in about 30 years time which is a pretty uh anemic return and you would certainly have hopefully been better off investing in an index at that point so you really have to be confident about the ability for that business to grow and you have to be confident about the ability for that business to grow for a long time so you have to be right for 5 10 15 maybe 20 years if you're investing in one of these really high multiple companies and that's not to say investing in those things doesn't work they can clearly work very very well it's just kind of a different bet to invest in a low multiple business where you're going to get a lot of capital back very very quickly so that's really my view on portfolio allocations i'm willing to bet maybe up to about 20 of the portfolio roughly in one particular stock but it really has to take a lot of boxes and i'm willing to size as low as maybe about five percent"", ""investments in Securities Market are subject to Market risks read all the related documents carefully before investing friends in this video for author advisor I am going to talk to the topic selling too soon when you buy very very early when you buy at a valuation which is completely in your favor the stock May double within a short span of time it could be less than a year or maybe within two years when this happens you feel you've made a lot of profit in a short spell of time and you start thinking that you will have to wait a long time to make more money but if you're so early in an idea it's actually worth waiting that long time because you will make a lot more money there have been instances where a stock doubled in a very short span of time and then went on to go up many times more later most people settle for that smaller component of profit you would find that that immediate doubling would barely be 10 or 20 percent of the total profit that the idea generates over seven eight years so imagine you're early you're the first to spot an idea you bought it early and you didn't last the journey you bailed out too soon this could happen to any of us what can change this because that's exactly what all of us need to do because you can have the best of ideas and you would be getting out too soon in them then at some stage you will start becoming so tired that you don't want to look at new ideas because you are regretting the mistakes you did of selling too soon the only way you can overcome this is by planning to stay invested even before you buy if you think from that prism you will see ideas which you can hold for longer periods of time that's the starting point if you start there then you rank companies which you can hold for a long period of time and then you buy the ones that are really cheap or attractively valued when you do this mentally you are conditioned to hold for much longer than just a double in stock price and when you are conditioned you keep telling yourself that this is what I did this is why I did this this is how I am going to invest and stay invested the entire thought process from the conception stage to the point of buying and across the period of ownership is then aligned clearly you don't get distracted by making quick profits and you don't mind waiting a little longer to make much bigger profits so the quick profit does not rob you of the bigger profit so when you make a double which may be twenty percent of the profits that you can make overall across the period of ownership you don't get distracted and you wait for the 80 and you try to make most of the profits and you get that into your portfolio into your financial success so extending your success happens only if you prepare to extend your success it is not an accident it will not happen suddenly it should start at the point of ideating the stock and that will help you stay invested and that will stop you from selling too soon try this for seven eight stocks across one market cycle and you will learn much more in that cycle than you learned across your investment experience so one must try to do something very differently learn what he needs to change about the way he invests stay exactly where you need to stay longer and invest only where you can stay longer that's the critical component that I believe will stop you from selling too soon when you buy very very high quality companies at very cheap valuations convince yourself that staying is equal to winning and that winning is equal to making tons of money that in essence is what every investor must condition himself towards and when you condition yourself towards that you're well prepared for big investment success thank you for watching this video"", ""and it only had 20 holes in it and every time you make a new investment you have to punch out one of those holes you would think long and hard about each individual investment you make and if we really want to minimize our invest results and you know basically burn our portfolio to the ground really quickly we're probably much better off trading actively you know paying high commissions all the time paying a lot of tax and reacting very emotionally uh to to market prices and the like rather than focusing on business fundamentals like I said in point number one we really want to combine those ideas of trying to predict what the market will do number one and then once we've got a good idea of what we think the market might do we want to trade as actively as we possibly can that real sort of mental Cesspool of trying to predict the market uh trading very actively and being extremely emotional uh that is just that's gold that that is exactly what you want to be doing now the third Point here for trying to get really bad investment results is uh perhaps for those that aren't quite as interested in point one and point two of uh trying to you know predict what the market will do and trade actively around that uh not all hope is lost there are other ways for us to lose money uh in our stock market Investments and the best way that I can really think of is to try and buy the poorest Quality Companies you can possibly find ideally at the highest possible prices now a great business defined by Warren Buffett is of course one that earns a high return on Capital so if we're looking for a bad business we want to focus on those that earn a low return on Capital and if you really want to push this to the limits ideally hunt out those businesses with a negative return on Capital the ones that are losing money hand over first and really don't have a lot of prospect for ever making money out into the future if we can combine that money losing ability with a lot of capital expenditures and increasing levels of debt particularly as interest rates go up that is certainly the worst possible business you can find and that's kind of part one of this particular step of Bad Business high price now to complete step 3 of bad business in high price we need to get the high price component and there's really two ways to approach this ideally you want to find a kind of a situation where both of these boxes are ticked and that is both a high absolute price and a high relative price so when I say a high absolute price this might be looking at perhaps the long-term average PE ratio on the market of 15 times and trying to find companies that trade much much higher than that absolute multiple once we've found maybe a basket of businesses in an industry that tend to have really high relative valuations uh you know why stop there we might as well pick out the one in the bunch that has the highest relative valuation so let's take all of our electric vehicle stocks for example that all tend to trade on really high multiples of sales and earnings and let's pick out the one where with the highest multiple of sales and earnings that's pretty likely to push us even more towards those very overvalued companies now my fourth tip here to minimize our investment returns in the stock market this year and and uh you know several years following that is the chase short-term winners particularly if their stock charts are just going up and to the right on an exponential basis and they look like they might be about to take off to the Moon those are really the stocks uh the hot stocks that we want to chase if the crowd is funneling towards a particular area of the market or even better a particular stock that is really the place we want to get our money in as quickly as possible if you hear your taxi or Uber driver you know mention a particular stock or a particular stock market kind of sector that is a great great place to hunt out some of these poor Investments and it really ties in well to point number three here because typically if there's a lot of people funneling uh you know money towards a particular investment often that will mean that investment has a very high price and uh we're getting kind of two birds with one stone when we do that so um chasing those hot stocks and chasing those potential short-term winners is a is a really good way to go now the final tip here to minimize our investment results is that anytime you find an absolute no-brainer investment one that's really likely to have very high investment returns moving forward the equivalent for example of someone literally handing you ten dollars and saying I will sell this to you for five uh anytime you see those really no-brainer opportunities you want to invest the smallest amount of money in that thing that you possibly can in the interest of diversifying widely now in all seriousness the diversification Point here is a little bit of a controversial one some people will certainly argue well in favor of diversification""]"
27,26,71,26_berkshire_charlie_munger_charlie munger,"['berkshire', 'charlie', 'munger', 'charlie munger', 'business', 'buffett', 'businesses', 'hathaway', 'warren', 'kind']","[""all right so firstly i just want to read a quick extract from uh buffett's 1981 annual report annual letter and this is under a section that is called berkshire acquisition objectives if you want to kind of go and find the letter i'll leave it linked down in the description below highly recommend reading through as many of these as you can so um basically the sort of preamble before the section i'm about to read buffett is sort of talking about how he'd struggled to find he'd struggled during that particular year to find a lot of private businesses to buy so berkshire hathaway buys both private businesses and public companies uh depending on basically the opportunity set they will tend to move into more heavily into one or the other just depending on kind of the opportunities available if private business investments look more attractive that's where they'll go if public business investments look more attractive that's where they'll go you know just depending on what's available at the time so with that in mind this is what buffett had to say so currently we find values most easily obtained through the open market purchase of fractional positions in companies with excellent business franchises and competent honest managements we never expect to run these companies but we do expect to profit from them we expect that undistributed earnings from such companies will produce full value subject to tax when realized for berkshire and its shareholders if they don't we've made mistakes as to either one the management we have elected to join two the future economics of the business or three the price we have paid we've made plenty of such mistakes both in the purchase of non-controlling and controlling interests and businesses category two miscalculations are the most common and that's referring back to sort of the future economics of the business of course it is necessary to dig deep into our history to find illustrations of such mistakes sometimes as deep as two or three months back for example last year your chairman volunteered his expert opinion on the rosy future of the aluminium business several minor adjustments to that opinion now aggregating approximately 180 degrees have since been required there you have it even the great warren buffett makes mistakes and he makes mistakes very very frequently and they generally fall into one of these three categories so either they partnered with the wrong management they were wrong on the future economics of the business or they simply paid too high a price so i want to walk through in more detail what each of those three things kind of refer to and try to give you some examples along the way um so sit back relax hit like on the video if you do enjoy and let's get straight into that so let's talk about the first mistake that warren buffett lists here with partnering with the wrong management now unfortunately for us as investors there are a whole range of things that managers of businesses ceos cfos boards of directors all sorts of people uh there's a crazy wide range of things that they can do that can really spoil an investment uh for individual stockholders who don't really have much say in kind of controlling and sort of running the business and although there are a wide range of things that can happen there's generally a couple of key kind of ideas that push management teams into making mistakes or doing things that aren't in the interest of shareholders and the first big one that i really like to look at strongly is simply the incentives of management now ideally what you really want as an investor someone at the helm of that company with the exact same incentives as you now the incentive for you as a shareholder is for the share price to go up is for dividend payments and share buybacks and things over time to to go up and for you to get a good long-term return from simply holding shares in that business that is your incentive now the incentive for the management team may be different uh in some cases it's similar um for example if we have someone as a ceo of a business who started that company and they have a very large shareholding in that business or if they have acquired a very large share holding in that business over time you know maybe someone like warren buffett at berkshire hathaway owns about a third of all the shares but didn't actually start the business or perhaps you have someone like mark zuckerberg at facebook who did start the business and has a substantial shareholding in the company if you're in uh and teamed up with one of those types of people you're going to be in a position where the incentives of both you as the shareholder and them as the management team are pretty much exactly aligned now one of the things you can run into every now and then is you have misaligned incentives so you have you as the shareholder hoping that the stock goes up over time and maybe you have a ceo that is incentivized on maybe one or two kind of key metrics within the business that don't always correlate with uh good returns over time now a really good example of this would be something like a management team being incentivized based on revenue growth now revenue growth is fantastic that's something that you ideally need over time in order to grow the earnings of the business generally as well um but there are some dodgy things that you can do to grow revenue without really growing the sort of economic prospects of the underlying business now for example you can go out uh you can borrow a bunch of money and you can acquire another business"", ""and he said that he often goes to Warren Buffett's house on a Sunday afternoon and they kind of just talk business and invest in and Buffett has said to him how many names in the s p are going to be at 15 times earnings in the next 12 months how many of those are going to earn more in five years than they are today with a 90 confidence interval and how many will compound at seven percent a year using a 50 confidence interval Combs kind of described that by going through this exercise you're solving for a range of things and eliminating a lot of businesses very quickly he said you're solving for cyclicality compounding and initial price and Todd Combs actually explained that this is one of the reasons that they found Apple a few years ago they were going through this process in the same three to five companies kind of just kept coming up over and over again and apple was one of those businesses to me this is really interesting because I've heard Buffett talk for years at this point about kind of the concepts behind valuation you know it's the whole a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush and how sure are you that kind of idea that uh Buffett has talked about for a long period of time but I've never seen sort of quantitative metrics put behind it and uh to see this idea of you know 15 times earnings and are they going to earn more in five years with a very high degree of confidence and slightly lower kind of confidence intervals around how long they can compound at a certain rate to have some quantitative data behind how Buffett thinks about that to kind of weed out a lot of stocks that he isn't necessarily interested in that for me is a pretty huge Insight next hot Combs talked quite a bit about company management and how it goes about assessing management teams and so on and some of the ways that he and Buffett think about company management and capital allocation he said businesses are run by people Buffett likes removing the cash from managers and investing it himself my interpretation of that is that's probably one of the reasons that Buffett is such a fan of sheer BuyBacks as opposed to CEOs going out and doing big Acquisitions and so on he also said that you know as we've heard many times before he's looking for a business that a dummy can run because eventually a dummy will run it and there's a very old school Charlie Munger idea about focusing on CEO incentives and that that can tell you a huge amount and there's a couple of things that Todd Combs had to say on that is Todd Combs said if he was 150 dedicated just to analyzing companies he'd focus on Delta reports and see what management is changing from year to year he said in 2005 beer Stearns which obviously ended up going bankrupt in the in the global financial crisis he said beer Stearns changed something very essential in their reports while saying something different to the street or saying something different to investors and analysts article goes on to say that a big signaling effect for Combs is when management changes the key performance indicators for which they are compensated by that's kind of a major red flag for Todd Combs and combs estimated that in the Fortune 500 approximately 20 percent of companies are changing incentive metrics for management and that that's not an accident again to get a really good feel for how management are thinking about running the business and their underlying incentives uh Todd Combs said that if he ever talks with company management he basically asks them two questions firstly he says how long do you spend talking to investors and secondly he says what would you be doing if you were not publicly traded if you were a privately owned business for example um he said the median response is about 25 percent of time is spent talking to investors and in response to the second question about what would they be doing differently if they were a private company um he said that generally management teams list off a few things that make a whole lot of sense and then Combs proceeds to ask them why they don't do that and they say because they feel handcuffed um you know they're forced often times to focus on quarterly performance they don't think they have the proper time Horizons they're not empowered to do the right thing and that's a really good example of again things that you would not like to see Berkshire hathway for example does not care about a quarterly performance at all they care about long-term performance they spend zero time talking to analysts they have you know letters and annual reports and stuff that come out and they have the annual meeting but they don't um you know spend day-to-day time kind of talking to analysts and that's a common theme I've actually seen through a few companies now over time that have successful track records toddcombe spent quite a bit of time talking about how he thinks about valuation and owner earnings for companies so he says that you should focus on basically two things you should focus on unit economics and the underlying business and you should focus on owner earnings as opposed to reported you know generally accepted accounting principles earnings he gave the example of birch Hathaway which you know each quarter has to Mark to Market their stock portfolio that flows through the income statement so in a quarter where the stock market simply goes up a lot berkshire's earnings can look really good and that is obviously not um kind of a true reflection of the underlying operating businesses so you really have to focus on the underlying earnings for a kind of true owner of that business how much cash could be extracted from the business after you know maintenance Capital expenditures and so on so that's one thing he pays a lot of attention to and the other thing like I said was unit economics and that can change quite a bit from business to business so he said for example you can have a software as a service business incurring 100 cents on the dollar and expenses on day one and uh going forward earn whatever the lifetime value of the customers so you have to have a view where you can understand what the financial image looks like for example in the early days of Walmart on Amazon I wouldn't focus on the fact that the reserves seem wrong and quite large look at where where it took them I build out unit growth economics and the case of Walmart look at each individual store and that's your North Star you backtrack"", ""Norbert Lou noted that you can identify certain business momentums in the real world that aren't necessarily the financials and allow for sustained High Returns on Capital now coincidentally around 2004 when Norbert Lou was in the very early days of his fund he actually traveled as part of a holiday to South America and to Argentina and he noticed a very dominant kind of beer brand in uh kilmirs I believe I'm pronouncing that correctly he basically said I remember seeing it everywhere sometimes alternatives to that brand were not even available he'd previously spent quite a bit of time basically just learning about beer businesses and reading annual reports of giant very highly valued beer companies like Anheuser-Busch and like Heineken but he'd never made an investment in any of those companies basically just because they they look too expensive but in the summer of 2004 he actually came across a press release from a company called quincer which owns the uh Kilmer's beer brand essentially and the first release explained that they were looking to pursue something called a Dutch Tinder offer for a large portion of their shares which is essentially just when a company tries to do a very large purchase oftentimes buying out quite substantial shareholders for essentially the lowest price they they can and this is what really prompted Norbert Lou to look much closer at the underlying company now there were a few things that kind of initially jumped out to Norbert Lou firstly there really were a lot of people that were turned off to the idea of investing in a place like Argentina they were very high interest rates there was a lot of inflation and the stock market had kind of just been depressed for a long period of time but for that reason when he looked at the kind of quincer company he saw that it traded at about six times operating earnings which made it just about the cheapest beer company he had ever seen you know trading at a much much lower multiples of earnings than companies like Heineken and Anheuser-Busch and so on he mentions in the out article that a critical thing was having some belief that just because it's Argentina doesn't mean you can't have a good company and if the country blows up it doesn't mean all the companies will be a disaster so after a deeper dive into the company Norbert Lou basically discovered three different things that made it a really interesting potential investment case firstly he found that Quincy had massive market share they'd been around since 1888 they had 80 market share in Argentina and almost 100 market share in Bolivia Paraguay and Uruguay and he was kind of asking himself the question you know why is that and to a significant extent he said one of the things that's so special about beer is this natural tendency for the industry to consolidate and for all the advantages to accrue to the largest player he noted that lots of consumers tended to identify with a particular beer brand you know in the U.S someone might identify as a Budweiser Drinker for example as as something that he mentioned and he mentioned that as the brands kind of start to build and scale up the sort of the self-reinforcing process where uh the beer brands that have the most sales tend to have larger advertising budgets that tends to lead to more sales it tends to lower their cost of production because they can scale into much larger production facilities and it just makes it really hard for other beer brands to compete essentially even very well capitalized International competitors can come into a market with their you know fancy new beer brand and they're going to find it really challenging to displace the beer brand that already has significant market share and that consumers are really identifying with personally all of that resulted in a couple of different things it meant that Quinta had about 60 Returns on invested capital and you know that survived a very long time they were founded in 1888 that survived Wars military coups and hyperinflation and the third thing that Norbert Lou really liked about the business is he felt that it had a degree of untapped pricing power he explains that for most companies in order to increase your Revenue you tend to have to kind of increase your expenses as well whether it's marketing or producing more units of whatever you're selling but he said with a small minority of companies you do have true pricing power you can put up the price of your products without necessarily having a material impact on the volume of that product that you're able to sell and if you can increase your prices and keep your expenses relatively flat that can do great things for operating margins and operating profits he noted two things with this particular company in relation to pricing power firstly people identify very strongly with the brand of beer that they drink and they're more than happy to pay a modest premium to other you know competitive Brands if they can drink the brand that they identify with and that they're used to and he also said that the bimberg family who had controlled the company for several decades had actually for a long time been raising the price at a far slower rate than simply the rate of inflation and for that reason he believed it was quite a bit of sort of latent pricing power built in here now the final sort of complicating factor that was happening at more of a kind of corporate level as opposed to the qualitative aspects of the business was that there was this quite complex uh put call agreement between the bimberg family who controlled most of the shares in this company and ambiv and it essentially meant two things one uh the benberg family had the right to sell this steak and the ambiv company had the right to buy those same shares at certain times in the future and after doing some kind of deep digging into various SEC filings and so on uh Norbert Lou was basically able to find that the price at which those transactions could potentially happen was very heavily influenced by the ebitdar of the business so you had kind of of a lot of things really aligning here for Norbert Lou you had basically the world's cheapest beer company you had a very dominant Market position you've got the lowest cost beer producer in the region because of their immense scale you've got untapped pricing power you've got a family looking to sell for the first time in Generations you've got that family incentivized to maximize earnings more than ever the simplest way to do that of course is to tap into some of that latent pricing power and all of these factors working in harmony created a very very compelling investment case for Norbert Lou now in terms of the timeline here Norbert Lou was doing most of this research in mid 2004 and the sort of price increase in game had actually already started back in 2003 so in 2003 um prices were bumped 10 percent in March another 10 in September and then another 10 throughout 2004 and throughout that period of time uh Norbert Lou's sort of pricing our latent pricing power theory was actually proven correct you know as the prices were being bumped up by by the company for this brand of beer the overall volume was actually still going up as well so there wasn't any notable impact at all on sales volume even with pretty significant price increases now interestingly there was actually an ADR listed in the US for quincer I guess a little bit like some of the Chinese technology companies today like Alibaba jd.com and so on they have American depository receipts listed on American stock exchanges so Norbert Lou was able to access ownership in the company kind of through that vehicle and he put on a 15 position in the punch card Capital portfolio in August of 2004 paying 17 per ADR in 2004 the company's ebitdar grew 48 in 2005 it grew another 40 percent uh prices kept increasing volumes kept growing and the operating kind of margins here for this business kept expanding very rapidly following that quite a few things happened firstly our Norbert Lou increased his position to about 20 and the fund""]"

29,28,69,28_credit_credit card_card_debt,"['credit', 'credit card', 'card', 'debt', 'score', 'credit score', 'credit cards', 'cards', 'loans', 'loan']","[""what this does is you essentially tackle the highest interest rate debt first so let's say you have five different types of debt and each one of them has a different interest rate maybe the credit card interest is the highest at 23% then you have maybe a personal loan at 17% then you have maybe some other type of debt like a student loan at 10% and then a home mortgage at 4% and an auto loan at 3% what you do in this case on the Avalanche method for paying off debt is you focus heavily on paying off the highest interest rate debt first now the key to doing this with with any debt payoff strategy that you ever use is you need to make the minimum payment every month for every type of debt that you have as soon as you start missing minimum payments two things happen first of all you get hit with the late fee I know that happens with credit cards you might get a thirty or forty dollar late fee if you skip your credit card bill don't do that"", ""so let's face it Americans have a lot of debt in fact we have over 14 trillion dollars worth of debt in the country now if you take away home mortgages and that still leaves us with trillions of dollars worth of student loans credit card bills personal loans auto loans the fact is we have a lot of debt that we owe to various different organizations and companies and so what I'm gonna do in this video is we're gonna break it down as simple as possible as how you can essentially implement one of the most effective debt payoff strategies and I want you to be very wary about people who are offering to help eradicate your credit card debt or to boost your credit score 200 points anybody who's who's offering that just be careful of what's in it for them in a lot of cases it's going to be taking a piece of the pie trying to get some money from you to help you and get rid of the the credit card bills that you owe so just be very careful with that when you go through this debt payoff journey but look we have over $30,000 in student loans on average when people graduate from college a lot of Millennials are flooded with debt and if you watch the previous video about how a lot of Millennials are going to struggle to get to retirement one of those reasons is because of debt and that holds people back from not only starting families from not only buying houses but it holds them back from contributing to their retirement accounts it holds people back from making life decisions for their long-term future for saving for their kids college plans because they're not able to save any money because they have so much debt so it's very essential to pay off debt as soon as possible I think a lot of us know that"", ""but even if you have all that money to just pay it in cash you should really never do that for reasons that i will get to in another video but as soon as you hit level 18 trust me get yourself a credit card because this side quest takes years to fully finish in order to build your credit history personally i recommend going with something like a secured credit card or this uh discover it's secured it's kind of like the gold standard if you don't have history and it's pretty cool because it gives you two percent cash back on different categories and one percent cash back on everything else but pro tip if you're a student in college instead of getting that one get yourself the cash back student edition of that card it's the same idea but it's going to give you better perks and the idea of this is to get a high score of 750 or higher and we could do all that within eight months to one year if you can follow these next few steps number one make sure to always pay your bills on time and never carry a balance because if you do you're going to pay more money in interest alone than all the rewards that you're going to get in return if you could do all that then 35 of your score will be accounted for just paying on time but if you miss your payment for whatever reason immediately pick up the phone and call the little number on the back of a credit card and ask them for forgiveness usually the first missed payment is going to be okay and it can be forgiven as long as you call and ask and number two is the utilization rate which accounts for a huge thirty percent of your score now if you can keep your utilization rate of thirty percent or lower you'll do just great for you have a thousand dollar monthly spending limit spend no more than three hundred thirty three dollars and thirty three cents but if you wanna be ultra conservative and do what i did and get there far quicker then utilize no more than ten percent or a hundred dollars or less in this case now you could literally just buy one little tiny thing like a pack of gum or just some gas and in that case your utilization rate will be in the single digits and that will improve your score dramatically and number three is your length of history which accounts for 15 of your credit score which is why it's so important to do this as early as possible now for me this is what drags my score down the most and if i had started when i was 18 my score would easily be over 800 by now but pro tip cheat code if you can have your parents co-sign on their credit cards for you then you will inherit their credit score if they have an excellent score i couldn't do this because my parents didn't have a good score but your mileage may vary if you can do these three things you will easily and quickly beat this side quest the third item on this list is something you need to get asap as soon as you hit level 18 it's probably the most important part of this video and that is a retirement account it could be traditional or a roth ira now think of these accounts like savings accounts except instead of putting your cash in here what you're putting in here is mostly stocks and the reason you want to do this is because it protects your money from taxes in the case of a traditional ira you pay no taxes today but you will pay taxes later on the money that it's grown into in the case of a roth ira you pay taxes up front but no taxes later in life when you withdraw those millions that you're ready to retire on if you have no idea which one you want to pick you can actually have both a traditional and a roth but remember you can only contribute six thousand dollars per year and you can contribute it down the middle however you want fifty fifty one year in one one year in the other doesn't really matter now if you could do this early look how much coin you can end up with assuming a growth rate of eight percent which is what you can expect from the stock market now assuming you started to max out your roth ira account at level 18 for three years only three years until level 21 when you're fully evolved into an adult you will have ended up with 781 thousand dollars which is an insane amount of money at retirement that's amazing if you had done this at 31 then you would have ended up with 287 000 at age 67 which is almost two and a half times less all because you started just 13 years later which isn't that much of a difference that's the power of time and compound interest at work so pause this video if you're 18 years or older and go and make that account because you're literally losing money right now""]"

contributor and I'm here today with our ask a fool series today's question comes from Roselle melodious who asks which is better a 457 plan or a 401 k plan now Roselle brings up a question that's really difficult for a lot of people to understand with all these numbers referring to IRS Code sections of the tax law but basically what we're talking about is a 401 K which is a normal retirement plan that employers in the private sector offer to their employees to help them save for retirement versus a 457 plan which is a similar type of plan that is usually offered to government employees and for most purposes they're very similar both tend to have limited menus of investment options that people can choose from and so in general my advice would be for someone to consider which investment options are better if the 401 K gives you a better set of low-cost investment options typically mutual funds or exchange-traded funds then the 457 then go with the 401 K on the other hand if your 457 plan offers better investment options that have lower costs and better potential returns then that's a reasonable choice to make as well now there's one aspect where 457 plans and 401 k plans especially differ and that has to do with penalties for early withdrawals 401 k plans if you take money out early before you turn age 59 and a half the money you take out is subject to a 10% penalty but that penalty doesn't apply to early withdrawals from 457 plans and so if you anticipate an early retirement where you're going to need to draw money from your plan then putting more money in a 457 may be your better bet if that's not a if that's not a problem however what you're really going to want to focus on is those investment choices and making sure you get the best deal that will help your investments grow as much as possible for more on saving for retirement in the various tax advantaged plans that are available be sure to stay tuned to to fool.com thanks for watching and fool on"", ""hello fools driver bro campus in your advisor for The Motley Fool's rule your retirement service as part of our ask a full series we have a question from Gil Gil asked what are the rules laws and regulations whereby a first time homebuyer can take a distribution from a Roth IRA to fund a home purchase and what are the tax implications involved so first of all let's define what a first-time homebuyer is it doesn't mean that you've never owned a home it just means that you've not owned a home in the past two years and to use this exception for any sort of IRA with the first-time home purchase it has to be for your principle residents can't be for any investment investment property or anything like that the general rule is for both traditional and Roth IRAs is that you can take out ten thousand dollars per person twenty thousand dollars per couple to use for a home purchase and you will not be subject to the ten percent penalty that most distributions are subject to when you take it out before fifty nine and a half now the interesting thing about the Roth IRA is that actually for any situation you can take out the contributions the money that you put in tax and penalty free because you already paid the taxes on it any growth and earnings you cannot take out before age 59 and a half except for some exceptions and one of those exceptions is the first-time homebuyer but only if the account has been open for five years if it has been open for five years you can take all that money out tax-free for the first-time home purchase if it has not been open for five years it is treated just like the traditional IRA when it comes to home purchases and that is the money the earnings are taxed as ordinary income you just escape the ten percent penalty the other thing you need to remember about this is that you don't have forever to do it you have a hundred and twenty days between the time you take the money out and the time you put it towards the home purchase so don't take it out too early I hope that answers your question Gail if you have any other questions about home buying taxes investing visit us on Facebook or fool.com"", ""investing is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth but before you can invest you need to set up a brokerage account like paying your taxes or making a three-way call it seems difficult but it's actually super easy i'm cyril doin and in this video from the isense money lab we're going to break down how to open a brokerage account and what you need to watch out for first you need to start by deciding what type of account you want and then comparing several online stockbrokers you should be able to choose the one that best meets their needs step 1 determine the type of brokerage account you need what are your investment objectives if you simply want to invest for a rainy day or for a certain relatively near-term goal and don't necessarily want your money tied up until you retired a traditional brokerage account is the way to go these accounts don't have tax advantages you may have to pay tax on investment profits and dividends but you are free to withdraw your money whenever you'd like if you choose a cash account your broker will likely ask you if you want margin privileges which basically means that you can borrow money to buy stocks with the stocks in your portfolio serving as collateral you'll pay interest on the broad money and there are some inherent risks involved with investing on margin that you should be aware of on the other hand if your goal is to save money for retirement an IRA is the best bet traditional IRAs can get you tax deductions when you contribute to them but you won't be able to use your money until you're 59 and a half contributions to Roth IRAs don't give you a tax benefit when you make them but qualified withdraws will be tax-free plus you can withdraw Roth contributions but not your investment profits whenever you want finally if you're self-employed there are some special options for you such as a simple IRA step IRA or individual 401k if you're specifically looking for an IRA check the description for a link to our guide to help you pick the best IRA step 2 compare the costs and incentives some major brokerages charge commissions some don't the costs have generally been coming down for the average investor but you need to know what you're signing up for so that fees don't eat up all your returns it's also important to review the brokers full pricing schedule particularly if you plan on trading anything other than stocks such as options funds or bonds as these often come with their own costs for example many brokers charge 75 cents per option contract on top of their standard commissioner finally many brokers offer incentives in order to attract business and you don't need to be a millionaire to take advantage of them I'm not saying that a good incentive all by itself should sway your decision""]"

interesting with barbiturn is that you can choose between flexible savings or fixed savings deposit crypto gain interest on the deposits without having to do anything the major difference between fixed and flexible savings are withdrawal and interest rates so the option you will choose depends on how patient you can be with your Investments for example imagine that you want to take Bitcoin you can choose if you want to stake for a look period or a flexible period when you click on select a wide range of options appear and show the percentage of apy depending on which type of staking you want if you choose a flexible taking period you can withdraw your posits whenever you want at whatever interest you have gotten on your principle this method involves receiving interest rewards just for keeping funds in a wallet if you suddenly change your mind you can withdraw the deposit at any time in this case you have 1.5 and apy if you decide to go on the flexible option but one thing to note is that with the apy in the flexible period you have a tier rate which means that the interest rate offered is subject to tier change but in the case you choose a locked staking period you will have to leave your deposit for a fixed period in this case 30 or 60 days but you also gain a higher apy in this case 1.8 percent staking Bitcoin the same thing happens with the other available coins if I choose to stake usdt I have three options a flexible period with a five percent API with a tier rate or a fixed period of 30 days which gives me 2.5 percent or a fixed period of 60 days giving me

many but there has been something of a buying frenzy for these commodities this year indeed the london bullion market association lbma for short were in a bit of a pickle in late january and early february this year essentially if strong inflows into silver-backed etfs had continued then that could have left the lbma london vaults running out of silver bars for those etfs the lack of silver was so great that the ishares silver trust actually changed its prospectus in early february by stating that quote the demand for silver may temporarily exceed available supply that is acceptable for delivery to the trust they went on to say it is possible that authorized participants may be unable to acquire sufficient silver that's acceptable for delivery to the trust so yes the concerns over shortages of the commodity are certainly real the good news for any crypto hoddler wanting to diversify their inflation hedge is that you can buy both gold and silver bullion with bitcoin bit guild and the european mint allow you to buy a massive assortment of gold and silver coins and bars with btc"", ""so if we go back to February last year in our web archives we can see that the hundred ounce bars trading around sixteen dollars an ounce when silver was around fifteen fourteen dollars at the time so again around a dollar or two over spot at the moment it's seven dollars over spot because there's just such a huge demand again Keith talks about this where on their website when silver fell from 18 to 12 they didn't drop their price down from their coins because they thought that's not fair value so all these guys to have their price up where they had it when silver was $18 an ounce so now we get to how we can take advantage of this and we want to use these different products so if we head over to eToro where i trade might you know my ETFs where it's the US markets and we're not things that we otherwise access to in Australia this is currently trading for $30 $30 below the actual silver price the ETF tends to track so we can do at the moment is by the SLV ETF and when it silver goes back to 18 or 21 dollars an ounce where I think it's going to go the price of silver here and the profits you're going to make are going to be up 50% from let's call it $14 to $21 to use round numbers that's a 50% gain so you're gonna be in 50% profit but at that stage once the the price of silver gets back up to 21 these hundred ounce bars you know they're only gonna be a dollar or two over spot so they're going to be trading for hopefully 22 maybe 23 dollars an ounce over spot now these are in aussie dollar prices so you know let's not get confused with all the math there but the point is that it's going to go from this beak gap at the moment which is currently around $7 back to around a dollar or two so while that is happening let's take advantage of that and let's ride the fake paper price up these ETF price up put on our traders hat make that extra money hopefully we've got 50% extra money and then we can choose to head over to our favorite bullion dealer and buy physical silver so if you do plan on doing that we're still running that promotion we also get $100 a Bitcoin when you sign up I'll put that link down below there's other ways to do this FTX have got their gold token XA UT and the packs g token so both of those are gold tokens or futures contracts we can arbitrage do the same arbitrage with gold that we just spoke about Aynsley have also got their gold and silver tokens over on coin spot and each token is one gram of silver"", 'central banks signed the fourth central bank gold agreement that goes into effect on september 26th the signing of the fourth central bank gold agreement reasserts by central banks the importance of gold as an asset in global monetary reserves the first central bank gold agreement was created in 1999 and was known as the washington agreement on gold at the time central banks held about 33 000 tons of gold which was about a quarter of all gold estimated to be above ground the central bank gold agreement was created because market fears about central bank intentions on gold caused the price of gold to decrease and become less stable in addition it caused an instability in the value of the assets of central banks this was also causing considerable hardship for gold producing countries many of which were heavily indebted poor countries the central bank gold agreement was signed by 15 european central banks the 11 central banks of the countries that were at the time members of the eurozone and also by sweden switzerland the uk and also the ecb in addition a number of other major holding central banks including the us japan australia the imf and the bank for international settlements either formally associated themselves with the agreement or announced that they would not sell gold with a five-year lifespan a new agreement that contains basically the same language has been signed every five years the agreement stated that gold would remain an important element of global monetary reserves and it agreed to limit the total combined sales of gold by central banks to 400 tons a year they also agreed that their lending and use of derivatives would not increase over the same five-year period in the press release for the first central bank gold agreement on september 26 1999 central bank stated the following quote in the interest of clarifying their attentions with respect to their gold holdings the undersigned institutions make the following statement gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves the undersigned institutions will not enter the market as sellers with the exception of already decided sales the gold sales already decided will be achieved through a concerted program of sales over the next five years annual sales will not exceed approximately 400 tons and total sales over this period will not exceed 2 000 tons the signatories to this agreement have agreed not to expand the gold leasings and their use of gold futures and options over this period this agreement will be reviewed after five years unquote in 2004 the second central bank gold agreement was signed for the second central bank gold agreement the wording was basically the same as the first one except the limit on the maximum total gold that central banks could sell

even faster rate the more time passes and that is something that we call the snowball effect with compound interest you're gonna be taking advantage of the snowball effect and what that means is that these small and seemingly insignificant results are going to have a massive effect or massive change over time so that little bit of interest you're earning every single year that interest on your interest it's going to have a massive effect on your savings and on your investing account years down the road and that right there is the reason why most people are not interested in compound interest because you have to have a lot of patience you have to understand this is a long-term investing strategy and you're gonna see most of the fruits of this years down the road 10 15 20 years down the road for people who are patient and understand the true power of compound interest you can reap the benefits but for people who are impatient and they can't see the long-term picture they're gonna end up wasting a lot of time and they're gonna wait until later in their life to begin investing now as I'm sure you guys can understand if you want to take advantage of compound interest the best way to do that is to give yourself more time a lot of people refer to compound interest as the time value of your money it's not about how much money you're investing it's really about how much time you're allowing your money to grow and so young people are at the biggest advantage young people have the most time to allow their money to grow the most amount of time they can allow themselves to earn interest on interest and as a result they can earn the most money through compound interest and as a young person if you are skeptical about this and you don't believe me talk to an older person and ask them what do you think I should be doing in my 20s as a young person I guarantee you most of them are going to say save more money and invest that money you're gonna thank yourself years down the road in fact Warren Buffett the most successful investor of our time attributes the majority of his success to compound interest he says my wealth has come from a combination of living in America some lucky genes and compound interest and Einstein also referred to this as the eighth wonder of the world"", ""so that's not really a fair analysis but all I'm getting at is that the bank is not the best place to earn compound interest you can earn compound interest through a bank account or through investments from your bank but this is not the way that most people are doing it now the second way you can earn compound interest is through the stock market and this is the best way to earn compound interest and that is because the stock market on average pays about 8 to 10 percent per year and that is a compounded return so following the rule of 72 here if you take 72 divided by your 8% return that means that you can double your money with the stock market about every 9 years and as a young person you will be able to experience more doubling cycles of your money than somebody who is much older so a 20 year old who starts investing their money is going to experience more doubling cycles than a 50 year old who begins investing their money and that right there is that time value of compound interest we were talking about the more time you allow your money to grow the more doubling cycles you'll experience and the more your money is going to grow over time and then another way that you can earn compound interest through the stock market is through dividend payments by reinvesting those dividends when you're paid dividends from a stock you can either take that dividend in cash or you can reinvest that dividend back into the issuing stock and if you reinvest those dividends back into the issuing stock you're earning dividends on dividends also known as compound interest so that is another way that you can earn compound interest for the stock market is through those dividend payments so on average a dividend stock will pay around a 3% dividend and just with that dividend alone you'll double your money every 24 years by investing those dividends and the great part of this is you can earn compound interest through asset appreciation as well as dividend reinvestment"", ""so how do you earn compound interest there's a couple of different ways you can do it some of them are really good and some of them are pretty lousy first of all one way you can earn compound interest is through your bank account through a savings account through a checking account through a money market account or through a certificate of deposit now is this a good way to earn compound interest absolutely not you're actually not even going to be outpacing inflation when you're earning compound interest through a bank account so I would not recommend doing this with your money don't put your money in the bank and think you're gonna become a millionaire through the interest earned from your checking account and if you guys don't believe me go out there and ask a millionaire how much money they made from their bank account and they're gonna tell you that they invested their money in the stock market or real estate or something else they didn't just put their money in the bank save their money let it sit there and build up a million dollar net worth so the best way to visualize these interest rates is to figure out how long it would take your money to double given that interest rate and you can calculate this very easily by looking at something called the rule of 72 and what that means is if you take the number 72 and divide it by your interest rate from whatever the investment is that's going to tell you how many years it's going to take to double your money at that given interest rate so take the bank account for example the average checking or savings account pays about a 0.05 percent interest rate so take 72 divided by 0.05 and you will find it's gonna take 1440 years to double your money so if you have $10,000 in your checking account it's gonna take you over 1,400 years for that to grow into $20,000 so that is a very lousy investment option moving on how about a money market a money market has a slightly higher interest rate and the average is around a 0.1% well not a 0.1 percent it's going to take you seven hundred twenty years to double your money so that is still a very lousy investment option and that's not an interest rate that most people would be happy with so moving on then how about a CD a certificate of deposit a short-term CD might yield about a 1% interest rate and that means that you will double your money in 72 years so if you invested $10,000 as a 20 year old and interest rates did not change by the time you are 92 years old you would have $20,000 now yes you could have a long-term CD at that point""]"

to no knowledge about investing but you want to learn more and you want to learn how to invest your money then this video is for you i'm also going to include some other great resources in the description below to learn from if you want to dive further which i highly recommend i'm going to talk through some terms for those of you that maybe don't really have any knowledge of finances or financial terminology and then kind of go through some different steps as well as some great ways to start investing your money today also stay tuned for later i'm going to be talking about stocks and that section video is sponsored by robinhood which is a platform i am a big fan of coming up soon as well as talking about some other ways to invest your money so before you considering investing you need to kind of take a look at your finances and i highly recommend trying to follow these steps first and foremost it's very important to have an emergency fund i talked about this in one of my other financial videos but this is just a great rule of thumb you never know what's gonna happen i mean we're literally living through a pandemic if that doesn't show to you enough that you never know what's gonna happen if you need emergency savings in case you lose your job or something just look at the news across the board it's recommended that you least have a month of money in your savings for an emergency and then to slowly grow that to three months to six months the second step is to pay off debt it's very important to eliminate debt as soon as you can because that's going to set you back in the long term and with any high interest rate debt you want to get rid of that before you start making any big investments because that's just money that's gonna keep going down the drain if you don't address it the third is to open a retirement account and i think i'm gonna make a whole separate video on this again as i've talked about the past i am a passionate advocate of starting your retirement as soon as possible i personally started mine when i was 19"", ""Oh or IPO he certainly didn't buy any lyft stock and that's because they're not looking for short-term gains or quick money they understand that long-term investing is how most people make their money and there's also significant tax advantages to being a long-term investor that is long-term capital gains versus short-term capital gains most high net worth investors have little interest in short-term capital gains and they will do anything they can to lower their tax bill so as a result buy-and-hold is often the strategy of any high net worth investors whether it's real estate bonds stocks whatever it is you typically see these people being long-term investors number three you see high net worth people investing in passive investments and the reason behind this is because they understand what their number one most valuable resources it's not their money it's their time and if their investments are consuming their time even if it's getting them a better return oftentimes they don't want that because they understand that their time is a much more valuable resource than potentially earning a little bit more money so rich people understand the value of their time and they're in most cases not interested in any time-consuming investments that are going to involve them you know being getting phone calls or being kept up late at night they don't want to be actively involved with their investments so you see a lot of rich or high net worth people investing in hedge funds or index funds or mutual funds these funds where they essentially don't have to do anything they're paying somebody else to manage that money and if they're fee sensitive obviously index funds are what they're going after but typically you know really rich people top one percenters are accredited investors and they're involved in hedge funds and different investments that you and me the average retail investor just do not have access to and then number four the final thing I wanted to add to this list that you see a lot with the top 1% is they invest a lot of money into charity and giving back now obviously you know you can't pour from an empty cup and if you don't yet have your own financial house in order it doesn't make sense to start giving money to other people but I do want you to think about this you know when you are in the situation or at the point where you have enough money to start giving back like a lot of the top one percenters do and rich people are often the most generous because they have the ability to be they have so much money and they have the abundance mindset and they know how much they can give back so just to give you a couple of examples of this the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which is a totally charitable cause had a value of 50 billion dollars in 2017 all money that is going to be given to charity and then second of all warren buffett since 2006 has given over 30 billion dollars to charity so right there we have eighty billion dollars being given by two of the richest people you know Bill Gates and Warren Buffett just to show you an example of what the top 1% are doing with their money and a lot of that comes down to the scarcity versus the abundance mindset and understanding that you know if you give it to people you're going to receive that's just understanding the law of attraction at that point"", ""hey guys welcome to the channel so i've been investing in the stock market since 2014 when i graduated college and in that time i've lost money i've made money and i've built up some really important investing strategies that have changed my life in this video i'll go over what those habits and strategies are and how they've resulted in my substantial portfolio growth over the last six years so let's get started number one is you should have started investing yesterday aka start investing as early as you can i'm happy because i got into investing right after graduating college when i opened up my roth ira and started playing with individual stocks however looking back at it i still wish i had started earlier investing out of college was pretty important for me and seeing the growth that i've had but you can always invest earlier now research time and time again has shown that when you start investing matters way more than how much you invest so what that means is the amount of years you spend in the stock market has an exponential effect on your growth and profits and this is because being in the stock market longer gives you the advantage of compound growth let's take a look at this chart showing the effects of investing 200 a month at different ages so the difference between starting at let's say age 25 versus age 45 is just spectacular the person starting at 25 contributes 96 000 total but has grown to over 500 000 by retirement the person that's starting at 45 however contributes 48 000 but their portfolio is worth only 100 000 so by being in the market for twice as long person 1 has 5x their money versus person 2 has only doubled it each year you hold back on investing takes away one year of crazy exponential growth thirty or forty years from now sure that five thousand dollars that you invest right now might only make you let's say four hundred dollars in the next year but in thirty years it's going to be making you about four thousand dollars each year by starting early i know that the longer i stay in the market the longer i am invested the more of an effect it will have this will lead to hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars of additional growth as i get older so what i urge you guys to do is if you haven't yet already start investing if you have the funds to do so prioritize starting early you don't have to invest a lot for day or month but the key is just to be in the market for as long as you can if you don't yet have an investment account i recommend opening up an account with weeble they're currently giving out three free stocks when you open up an account and deposit 100 or more""]"

with now i'd say that around 80 to 90 of the people i talk to or hang out with actually work for themselves and that has been a complete game changer entrepreneurship is really lonely and it's even lonelier if your friends can't relate to your struggles or you can't bounce ideas off of them so an actionable that i will give you guys right now is to go out and actually find entrepreneur friends check out your local meetups you know look on social media groups dm people on instagram you know find friends of friends this is super important and something that you should definitely be doing before you actually quit your job if you pursue entrepreneurship alone there is a chance you'll quit after some roadblocks if you're not alone on this journey however you won't quit it's also going to make you way more likely to be successful and the main reason for this is because of masterminding i've learned so much from my friends and i'll be nowhere near as close to where i am today if it weren't for them for example i was inspired by my girlfriend's mom janelle she worked her butt off to create a really successful medical aesthetics practice here in southern california and seeing the life that she built for her family was super inspiring i have tons of career friends who you know i bounce ideas off of all the time we learn from each other about what works and what doesn't work my friends like carlton who i met in this apartment building and he got me completely hooked on tax strategy which of course has been a complete game changer really your network gives you a huge competitive advantage for example i'm starting up a blog right now and one of my friends ryan scribner is actually a pro blogger and"", ""but when I look at beginners and I look at people getting started or even veteran entrepreneurs the reason they can't get started the reason they hang and going is because they don't work on themselves if you want your business to succeed work on yourself work on your views work on your opinions because nothing is going to work until you work on that for example most beginners get in they don't know how to focus on one thing they don't know how to do good work they can't make their bed for lack of better words they're extremely disorganized they have no discipline in their life they have tons of bad people they're not able to remove bad things from their life their goals are super short sight it's make money now make money now make money now if you go look in any beginner group the last thing talked about is the customer the last thing talked about is a customer and the last thing they actually care about is delivering anything good because most beginners get into the business model and I get it this is not hating on beginners this isn't a character fault this is how everybody thinks when they first get in the business they're not pursuing mastery and are not pursuing getting good they're not trying to do hard great work they're not trying to become good at something they're trying to cash out super quickly and all their flaws all their personality traits that they haven't dealt with all their insecurities come leaking out into the business instead of paying employees on time they hold money and instead of trying to get better employees they take short-term decisions the way your business operates the amount of progress you make it's all gonna come down to your views on life and your views on people your ability to make really good decisions and your discipline as a person and your ability to actually manage your own

actually a solution and the solution is to buy my course where I will teach you how to side hustle three-card Monty Style just kidding I'm an idiot I won't actually do that here's the actual solution so the one piece of advice that I wish I knew and I wish I'd taken is to switch jobs every two to three years and that's about The Sweet Spot and enough time to tell future employers that might hire you that you are committed to a long-term job without your resume looking like you're just bouncing around and you don't know what you're doing in fact according to a 2023 jobs data from zippya wage growth for job switchers is 47 higher than those who stay in their current job because on average you can expect to increase your salary by 14.8 percent by moving which is compared to wage growth which is only 5.8 percent on average if you stick with your old job so even data shows that being loyal and sticking to one job for the long term is not the most financially rewarding thing to do so Valerie from Tick Tock was actually right loyalty doesn't pay switching jobs does unfortunately there is one industry where this doesn't actually work and that is Leisure and Hospitality which had a negative wage growth when switching jobs so rip my Vegas friends now the good news is that data shows most of the people that watch my YouTube videos happen to be within 25 to 34 years old and that is also the range that sees the highest average increase across the board for switching jobs at almost 10 percent now this is a true story"", ""well the concept of the nine to five job it first started in 1867 in illinois it took a while but in 1926 henry ford started using eight hour work days for some of his employees and then finally in 1938 franklin roosevelt he signed the fair labor standards act of 1938 and this basically made working 40 hours standard anything you worked above 40 hours would be considered overtime so the 8 hour work day really came from a good place because back in those days people would work a lot like they would work 12 hour days so as a result this new rule this new law made it much more manageable for many workers in the united states but seriously you guys this was almost 100 years ago do you realize how much the world has changed since then in my opinion the world is so much more awesome right now than before we have the internet we have outsourcing we have globalization and of course we have new types of jobs that mean you don't have to stick with a nine-to-five job anymore nine-to-five jobs in fields such as manufacturing or labor and other things are probably still needed but in this video i'm focusing more on those corporate careers those very typical nine-to-five jobs that people picture when they think about corporate life one of the biggest problems is that humans just cannot sustain productivity for a long time at all like for example working in an office for eight hours does not guarantee you that you are productive for all those hours in fact research shows that the average employee only has about three hours of actual productivity per day so that literally gives us like five hours of non-productive possibly useless time spent in the office funny story i was talking to one of my friends who actually got an mba online"", ""but you just focus on one point let it be this because it's important anytime you work a career that pays you hourly most of the time you will plateau rather quickly there's just so many hours you could work on a day before eventually you max yourself out and when you reach that point you've hit a ceiling but by working any job that pays based on results your income has the potential to skyrockets because now hours no longer make a difference personally i think sales is one of the most underrated careers out there it's usually a stepping stone to making more money it'll teach you everything you need to know about time management and customer service and it could provide the funding for almost anything you want to do later on now if you're not the type who wants to go into sales and you want something a little bit more stable and consistent but you still want to make more money just consider this employees that stay in their companies longer than two years get paid an average of 50 percent less so in the interim consider switching careers leveraging your skills and using that as a way to make more money especially now when so many businesses are experiencing a shortage of talent and are willing to pay anything they can to find the right person but overall i would say that most people you hear about who built up a crazy amount of wealth rather quickly starting from nothing did so by starting a business they saw an unfulfilled niche and they created a solution to a problem or they saw an existing business doing well""]"

traders options range in complexity from simple events such as highs and lows to complex situations and pattern recognition to alerts aimed more at the institutional trader such as the V WAP and blocked trade analysis alerts the second tab titled window specific filters allows a user to filter the universe of stocks that is currently being tracked since trade ideas looks at all stocks in real time all the time if a user does not apply any filters it is easy to get inundated with information trade ideas does not require the user to know anything about programming or technical analysis it has a library of pre-configured strategies that can be used right out-of-the-box let's take a look at the high-low ticker high-low tickers are available in some applications but none give you the multi timeframe option which allows you to see the long term and the midterm trends for stocks making highs and lows additionally this is a good example of how fast information can come through trade

can come through let's unleash the full power of the system through its filters as I mentioned earlier filters located on the second tab from the left are a way to limit the amount of stocks that trade ideas monitors just like the alerts filters range from the very basic such as minimum price maximum price and average volume you know right now these filters are blank because by default we are monitoring every new high and low let's put some values in there to make things a bit more specific now the system is only looking at stocks between 10 and 100 dollars and that have a maximum spread of 10 cents at the time of the new high and low and trades an average of 1 million shares per day now let's press ok and notice how the flow of data slows down to meet the filtered criteria as we look further we notice that filters allow you to paint almost any type of graphical picture in your mind to look for very specific positive or negative situations the more you learn about filters the more power you will get out of this software additionally you can filter for stocks traded on certain exchanges and you can create symbol lists to monitor only a specific group of stocks that you want to monitor finally after setting your alerts and filters you can name the window something that makes sense in terms of what alerts and filters were created for example we will name this window trade

overall net profitability is plus 4.72 but you can tweak the properties of this strategy if you go back into the pine editor and edit the variables so you can tweak this and look at where it succeeded

going to change the success of the strategy so we can see on the hourly time frame it didn't perform as well whereas on the two hourly time frame it did perform fairly well on the three hourly time frame it was even more profitable and if we go into a higher time frame like the daily it was even more profitable netting a 6.77 profit of 67 000 now if you were to trade using the strategy on the

short series that explains covered calls if needed before watching this video you may want to watch the first video in my basic option series titled what is the stock option a covered call as a combination of two positions the first is a long position on a stock or ETF the second is a short position on a call option when one buys a call option they are locking in a preset buy price for an asset when one sells or shorts a call option they are selling their commitment to later sell an asset for a preset sell price therefore placing a covered call means that the trader is buying a stock or ETF and then selling an option contract that locks in the right for the option buyer to buy that stock or ETF from the trader for a preset price let's look at a hypothetical example to explain let's say stock XYZ is currently trading for $10 to share to place a covered call the trader buys a hundred shares of the stock for $10 a share he also sells a call option contract with an $11 strike price that expires in a month he is paid twenty five cents that share upfront for selling the option the trader has bought XYZ for $10 a share he has also sold the right for someone else to buy XYZ from him for $11 to share and he was paid 25 cents a share for that right if the price of XYZ is above eleven dollars a share when the call option he sold expires the traders obligated to sell his shares of XYZ for $11 a share he bought XYZ for $10 a share and he sells it for 11 so he makes $1 a share on the stock plus he was paid 25 cents a share selling the option so his total profit is a dollar 25 a share if the price of XYZ does not rise above 11 dollars a share before the option the traders sold expires the option expires worthless this means that the trader keeps his stock plus he keeps the 25 cents that he was paid upfront for selling the option as profit the next month he sells another option and the process repeats the risk for a covered called trader is that the price of the underlying stock makes a large move downward the premium that the covered called trader collapsed somewhat helps protect the trader against a downward movement of the underlying stock when placing a covered call a trader must choose which stock or ETF to buy and which option to sell on that stock or ETF there is a trade-off between potential profit versus downside risk for each option the trader could sell the trader must consider the cost of the option in other words the amount he would collect upfront the price at which the option is exercised in other words the option strike price the amount of downside protection that the option provides and the break-even point therefore the selection of which stock or ETF to use for covered calls and which call option to sell on that stock or ETF depends on the strategy and goals of the trader in the next video we will look at examples of covered calls I hope that you enjoyed this video thanks for watching you"", ""hello and welcome in this video I show an example of selling a put option to buy stock for this example I will use sov the silver ETF at the time of making this video sov is currently trading at eighteen dollars and sixty two cents per share let's say that a trader wants to buy a thousand shares of sov to hold long term however this trader only wants to buy sov if the price of sov drops to $18 per share which is the price that he feels is a good price to buy and hold at one choice would be for the trader to place a limit order for $18 and leave it open if SLV drops to $18 below the order is executed and the trader buys the thousand shares for $18 a share as he wanted to do another choice would be for the trader to sell ten $18 put options that expire in one month by doing so he is agreeing to buy a thousand shares of sov from the buyer of the options for $18 per share if sov should drop to $18 or below the buyer of the option space it upfront cost to buy the options called a premium in this case the premium is 33 cents a share of $330 total for premium varies from stock to stock depending mostly on the stops volatility now let's compare the two choices trader a places an open limit order to buy a thousand shares of sov for $18 and trade of B sells 10 $18 put options on sov let's say SLV does not drop to $18 a below over the next month trader a sits there with his open $18 limit order and nothing happens however trader B sold 10 $18 put options and was paid $330 to do this because sov does not drop to $18 below the put options expire worthless and unused so trader be simply Kisa $330 for trader a nothing has happened the entire month except that he had to leave 18,000 dollars sitting unused in his account waiting for the price of SLV to drop for Trader be things are a bit different he sold 10 $18 put options and was paid $330 to do it he also has $18,000 sitting in an account as well but he has made $330 worth it which is almost a two percent return in a month on his $18,000 his money is also sitting unused waiting to buy the same stock trader a is waiting to buy however he has made a 2% return in a month on that $18,000 let's say instead that sov drops to 1775 a share the limit order for trader a is executed and he buys a thousand shares of sov for $18 to share the put options for trader B are executed and he is assigned a thousand shares of sov for $18 a share which is a fancy way of saying that he buys a thousand shares of sov for $18 a share from the guy he sold the options to now let's compare it is important to note here that I'm leaving off commissions for simplicity trader a less $18,000 sit in an account then bought the stop for $18,000 with the current price of 1775 per share he is down $250 traitor be sold 10 put options and was paid in this example a total of $330 for this he also bought the stock for $18 a share but he was paid a total of 33 cents a share upfront so his total net cost is 1767 per share he is up 80 dollars while trader a is down 250 remember that both traders wanted to buy and hold the stock for $18 per share and both traders did that if the stock had never gone below 18 dollars a share trader B keeps selling put options each month making money while trader aids money just sits in his account unused let's say that sov drops way down in price both traders were gonna buy SL via $18"", ""but he had locked in the right to sell sov for $18 per share he sells SLV for 18 and he paid a total of 17 dollars and 33 cents per share so he makes 67 cents a share - brokerage commissions the trader paid 33 cents per share to lock in a sell price of $18 per share therefore for the trader to make money the price of sov must be lower than 17 dollars and 67 cents per share in other words sov must drop at least 33 cents per share below the locked-in sell price of $18 to pay for the 33 cents per share cost of the option locking in a sell price of $18 per share for a cost of 33 cents per share means that sov must drop to 1767 per share or below if sov does not drop below 1767 a share the trader loses money if sov stays at or above $18 a share the trader would not choose to use this option to sell the stock at $18 per share since you can get more for selling it at the current price at the time of more than $18 per share therefore the option expires worthless and the trader loses to 33 cents he paid up front if sov drops below $18 per share but not below 1767 per share the trader does use his option he buys sov at the current price of between 1767 and 18 and sells it for 18 making the difference between the two however the amount he makes is less than the 33 cents upfront cost he paid so he loses some money but not the whole 33 cents to share he would lose if sov was at $18 or higher now let's compare shoulding a stock versus buying a put option shorting a stock requires more capital upfront buying the $18 put option only cost a trader $33 upfront if the trader shorts the stock and the stock rises in price his losses are potentially unlimited as the stock can climb to any price but by buying a put option instead his possible losses are capped to a maximum fixed amount of 33 cents per share or $33 total plus commissions even if the trader shorts sov and uses a stop loss to protect his account to a maximum loss the price of SLV could gap overnight or over the weekend causing him to lose more than anticipated the possible losses on buying an SL V put option is cap to a fixed amount if sov does drop in price the potential percent gain is much greater with an option let's say that sov drops is $17 per share the profit on an option trade is a much larger percentage of the required money up front there are two trade offs here the first is that sov must move a certain amount for the option to become profitable so sov could drop in price only a little bit causing the traitor that shorted sov to be profitable but not enough that the put option is profitable the other trade-off is the time factor whereas the trader that bought the put option has a much larger potential gain and a capped maximum loss his contract has a one month time limit in this example the trader chose an $18 put option on sov when the current price of sov was $18 and 62 cents a share this was not his only choice of contracts to buy in the next video we will look at other contract choices to trade or could choose with emphasis on the relationship between the upfront cost of the options also known as a premium the preset sell price that is locked in also known as the options strike price the potential gain the potential loss and where the price of sov has to be in each situation for the trader to be profitable""]"

about each crypto gaming project because they're all intricate all these ecosystems and infrastructures and the way that they operate are all different so we're going to talk about all that and more in this Edition without further ado let's get into it so let's go ahead and dive in shout out to our sponsors quickly Anna mocha Brands the biggest web3 gaming company in the world Unix gaming one of

top project and this is one that I get asked about all the time I see the chat box all the time talking about pyr Vulcan Forge you know y'all want to know more information about Vulcan Forge so we're going to start this ongoing series with Vulcan Forge which is sitting at about you know when we look at the market cap at this very moment in time of a fully diluted of 158 million and an 86 million dollar market cap I think there's a ton of upside for everything that they offer top to bottom and let's go ahead and take a look you know what is Vulcan forged I would honestly have to ask what isn't Vulcan Fords I mean they have games they have in Marketplace in-house where you can use the pyr token to actually purchase and sell your nfts they have you know land they have I think 12 different games they have an ex"", ""so nothing's really changed on my stance i'm still sitting on my hands i'm ready to deploy and i'm ready to deploy when great projects like vulcan forged are getting backing in their series a from ftx and skybridge in a major metaverse move so as we're seeing here vulcan forge a leading blockchain gaming studio and incubator today has secured its series a with ftx and skybridge and this is absolutely massive obviously uh anthony scaramucci and sky bridge i believe they have 2.5 billion in management as we see scaramucci tweet we are thrilled to be joining vulcan forge community and backing jamie thompson who is behind vulcan forge jamie thompson is awesome we've had him on the show here and interviewed him from vulcan forge i love everything that they're doing and obviously if you watch the show they've been one of my highest conviction projects for a long time and one of the most exciting metaverse and gaming platforms and i definitely agree right vulcan forge is building a lot of quality projects and they just keep on going i mean i believe right now it's 10 plus projects coming to the staple and now that sky bridge is getting involved you know there's just so much more bandwidth even for vulcan forge to work with and they already have a war chest to work with anyway as they are producing quality left and right as we see their very own press release here as we'll take a look at it as skybridge led the round for 8 million for an eight million dollar round which includes the option to invest an additional 33 million to accelerate the growth of vulcan forged patent and metaverse as a service engine metascapes and enables the company to scale operations in north america so what they're going to do vulcan forge is looking to headquarter over in north america obviously i there they are some i believe in their in europe somewhere if i'm correct uh"", ""so I I really think it's really sharpened up everyone's Minds to like okay uh you know you really have to dive into these and really find out who's behind these projects and who's pushing these products and who's actually going to adopt and use and actually what is this applicable for tokenomics ETC and that's what we're here to break down for you every single day because you know if you have all these tools in your belt that we're giving you on this channel then you're going to be able to actually take advantage of this bear market like I said and then Vulcan forged looking forward to a firm part of you know what we're looking at as far as probably my top tier gaming probably my top tier gaming accumulation out of this bear Market everything they've done with Anthony scaramucci skybridge Capital the Elysium blockchain the Met escapes platform it's just absolutely phenomenal This was meant to be on polygon uh on talking about polygon about how the number of nft wallets is really approaching it is approaching the ethereum chain as far as the number one spot on in terms of nft Wallets on different chains so that's good to see as well but when you look at Vulcan Forge the med escapes platform is looking brilliant now this is their metaverse as a service platform this is their meta versus a service platform we're looking at what Jamie Thompson and Anthony scaramucci have said in a recent interview is that you know Jamie's for the CEO of Vulcan

alternatively if we were to break above and close above 38.80 on the S&P500 then these markets could defy gravity and go higher today was a reminder that the Bulls and the Bears they show up every day to fight out the direction of the markets everybody of course is saying that the markets are going to go lower and the Market's going to crash in 2023 and that's how I've set up my personal trades I'm positioned for stocks to go down however today's action reminded me that the Bulls are going to show up each and every day and fight out the direction for each and every stock these markets are not just going to be handed to the Bears I mentioned in a video a couple days ago that the vix was low it was sitting on support and that it was getting ready to fire off and get the markets moving and that's exactly what happened today the vix jumped around six percent I think that's just the beginning of the vix party I think it's just getting started I want to remind everybody what the vix is it measures volatility of the S&P500 and that volatility that it measures is the fear and stress of the Traders a while ago I gave an example of what the vix is like it's like a bunch of Traders when they go through an alley they're buyers but when they turn around and go back the way they came they're sellers and the vix measures how fearful everybody is so when some data reports come out if they come out and they scare everybody then they quickly sell their stocks they turn around they go back the Direction"", ""well if we look at the S&P500 if we look at the SPX which measures the S&P500 it wants to get around perhaps as high as 41.50 that's the big potential move that we might have ahead of us the Spy maybe around 40 4 15 420 then I believe it's unavoidable that we are going to tank too much negative news out there too many problems recession the way that we're going to have it has absolutely not been priced in and the move of the FED has not been priced in these guys are talking super hawkish different state feds were calling for a terminal rate as high as 5.6 up to this point only a 5.1 had been measured or priced into the markets there is basically in addition they know they notified us that there is no plan to Pivot in all of 2023 they do not intend to lower rates anytime soon that's the message that they gave us it was highly hawkish and to be honest with you I'm surprised we didn't get a much stronger sell-off I did add to my short position in the SQ QQ and the spxs I want to remind you guys that those are inverse ETFs they go up when the NASDAQ and the S&P500 go down we cannot load up on puts or shorts just yet even though I'm increasing my position size because we have to make sure that the full move up has been realized we got today technically we got a double top on the S&P500 as well as a doji candle I want to remind you that doji candles Mark indecision that's typically when the Bears and the Bulls are fighting equally and neither one of them overpowers the other it largely points to indecision the markets had this news from the FED today and it it responded with indecision not a strong response that's a little bit confusing because the news was in my opinion negative and hawkish and pointed to stocks falling in value because the FED is continuing to take money out of the system so those are the technicals I'm continuing to look at them I'm imagining that we're going to see an increase in the vix and volatility in the next couple days we have to be smart we have to wait for confirmation before taking our big position it if we take our positions correctly at the ideal time that's what's going to lead to the big money as always guys like subscribe and hit that Bell to be part of the conversation I'll see you in the chats peace and blessings my friends"", ""yet again another deviation right as it passed the 200 week the perfect opportunity to close positions and start shorting and week by week by week it has been read and read and it looks like we are coming right back down to see whether or not the S&P500 let's get hold on that 200 week like it did before if it snaps through there if it cannot hold that range of support you've got a great thesis for this pulling not just a March 2020 collapse but potentially having a 2008 style collapse as we've highlighted the relationship between the 200-day moving average the 200 week are very important and this has played out time and time again through previous bear markets and if that is the case it could very well mean that we are far ways away from finding the absolute bottom perhaps it's not going to be as brutal as 2008 per house it won't be as brutal as the.com bubble I'm not here to say that what I'm here to say though is that the charts are at least telling us we've got more pain to come Dow Jones is doing exactly what it did during the.com bubble showing more resiliency and strength as these are the more well-established defensive plays but yet again getting shot down at consistent resistance deviating exactly as we pointed out here back in November of 2022 and yet again more red weeks here if this breaks below the 200 day we're at a minimum likely going to come down to test the previous lows if not break to new lows and that is going to weigh that Mark it's big time but a lot of people have been asking me Nick are you being a bit too bearish here are you a bit too concerned about things are you thinking too much in a negative light I think there are a lot of clear weakness signs across the board in equities first one here is from some of the financial players Credit Suisse this has started to fall off a cliff yet again in August we broke through a decade-long descending channel so this already gives Credit Suisse one of the weaker Financial Banks in the system already some degree of support on its stock price that level has been broken and that was a descending Channel and now it has rolled over after it was clear that the FED is not pivoting that Credit Suisse is likely in trouble and they're even after you know going after bloggers and things like that for spreading fun this and that case in point I'm not here to say anything specifically about the company I'm just here to say stock price doesn't look good it looks like it's heading south as it's been doing so since back in November of 2021.""]"

crypto coins will fade into total irrelevance when you're sitting on life-changing gains you have got to sell the only people let me repeat this the only people who make any money ever in crypto are the people who click on the sell button never click sell you never make anything by the way you want to know the best time to sell pretty simple when everyone is screaming new paradigm of money when the tacticals are all overbought it's not a coincidence that the most dangerous time to buy is also the best time to sell keep that in mind also here's a thought for you this is number seven do you really want to become richer and more successful than 99 of people and if so why it's not going to make you happier"", ""and I put together packed with Alpha on altcoins D5 nfts and much more we spent about 40 hours a week putting this thing together so you can read it in 10 minutes join our over 63 000 weekly readers and sign up for free yes for free use that link Down Below in the description now the second big reason why people lose money in crypto is that they buy and sell at exactly the wrong time every time most people only wait to buy at the highs when the Euphoria kicks in feels safe but the famous saying goes what is safe in investing is rarely profitable the best times to buy or when the markets are in the red when nobody wants to buy it as a scam it's all going to zero right when everyone's freaking out not when a coin is hitting a new all-time high or when we're seeing overbought technical indicators flashing right those are more dangerous Times by the risk is higher actually than buying when things are scary basically if you buy at that time you're just signing up to be a bag holder to be someone else's exit liquidity and to experience pain and loss look you need to be able to think clearly in this market to think unemotionally in this market look we all mess up sometimes we do been there right the rule is really simple though Buy Low sell high and be careful of extremes when we see Extremes in markets to not be overly emotional right don't be overly optimistic near the top and don't be overly scared near the bottom both are equally dangerous to your folio remember there are still people out there sidelined waiting and hoping for Bitcoin to drop down to ten thousand dollars that's Max Payne right now during this hated rally as crypto keeps going up and the biggest reason the vast majority of people in this market do not and will simply never ever ever make any freaking money fail to take profits not a single sell button"", ""so once you've estimated how high and how long cryptos on your list could pump in response to upcoming events and announcements the next steps are to decide how much to allocate and when to take profits it should go without saying that going all in on a crypto you think is going to pump is a very bad idea this is because there is no guarantee that the pump will play out exactly as you projected it could start earlier or later last longer or shorter go higher or even go down in response to the news you're banking on in a worst case scenario your investment could go to zero and though you've heard this about crypto before it's especially applicable in this case that's because it's safe to say that big cryptos like bitcoin are here to stay but the same can't be said for many of the altcoins you'll inevitably end up holding as part of your mission to the moon as such it's wise to put down only what you're willing to lose not only will this help minimize your losses but it will also make cashing out easier if or when the gains start to come in that's because it's really hard to take profits if you have a huge allocation and prices are going parabolic reducing your exposure will make it easier to abide by a risk-off profit-taking strategy as i mentioned in my video about my personal crypto trading strategy the irrationality of the market often means that any sort of logical analysis doesn't work when prices really start to pump that's why i personally take profits based on the percentage gains i have rather than any psychologically comfortable price points or price targets revealed by ta more importantly i tend to keep some of my coins and tokens in the race in case the rally continues this can and often does happen especially when market euphoria is at an all-time high on that note it's worth quickly pointing out that smaller altcoins don't always care about what the rest of the crypto market is doing all coins almost always follow bitcoin's lead but there have been many instances of altcoins continuing to pump even as the rest of the market carries on dumping even so it's important to be aware of what the rest of the market is doing and factor that into your measurements allocations and profit taking strategies if we're bleeding red across the board you might want to reduce the height and length of any pumps you're predicting reduce your allocations and lower your cash out expectations in the short term once you've decided how much to allocate and when to take profits for the cryptos on your pump list the last step is to consider whether any of those cryptos has some serious longer longer-term potential chances are you'll come across a couple of these during your crypto quest and you'll know you've found a winner when you see some most or all of the following features first and foremost there's a use case or utility for the coin or token that creates constant demand for it this is because the constant buying pressure should increase its price over time second the coin or token is listed on a few reputable exchanges like kucoin and binance but has yet to list on any u.s exchanges like coinbase kraken or gemini this is because most of the money flowing into crypto is coming from the united states and as regulators continue to crack down on offshore exchanges more of this capital is staying on u.s exchanges the thing to keep in mind here is that the cryptocurrency you think has long-term potential could be too similar to a security i.e a stock in a company to us regulators this means u.s cryptocurrency exchanges won't be able to list that coin or token now you can familiarize yourself with the criteria currently used to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security or not by watching my video about the ripple versus sec lawsuit in the description the third feature of a crypto with long-term potential is lots of partnerships with popular crypto projects and protocols this is because the future of cryptocurrency is interoperability and if a crypto project has made little to no effort to cooperate and integrate with its competitors it will have a hard time flourishing in the future the fourth feature of a crypto with long-term potential is lots of vc funding assuming this vc funding comes after the cryptocurrency's main net has launched already as i mentioned in my video about the most funded crypto projects this is because any investments made by vc's post main net are a strong sign that the project is legit and still has a lot of potential the fifth feature of a crypto with long-term potential is constant development and innovation this is because the crypto space is insanely competitive and a failure to evolve can be fatal for a project the last feature of a crypto with long-term potential ties into the fifth and that's the absence of any serious competition within that cryptos niche this is because a monopoly on a certain technology or use case is insanely profitable as proven by chain link which dominates cryptocurrency's oracle niche now these are just a few of the features that define a crypto project with long-term potential and you can learn about the others by watching my video on how to find promising altcoins it's up there in the top right they say you can't predict a crypto pump but recently i found that these pumps usually have many of the same characteristics this methodology can be summed up in a single sentence and that's to pay very close attention to what's going on in cryptocurrency and be honest with yourself about what you see and what it means i personally don't chase pumps mainly because i don't think it's a sustainable long-term investment strategy i prefer to stick to huddling and swing trading cryptocurrencies i believe to be legit because there's more to life than chasing pumps and crying over dumps having said that it is interesting to go digging through the lower levels of the coin market cap leaderboards every now and then and observing some of the crazy price action in those low-cap altcoins which one could be next that's my two cents for you today folks if you enjoyed the video be sure to give that like a spike

story about anxiety fear and waiting so dr friedman who is a cardiologist hired this upholsterer to come in and reupholster the chairs in his waiting room because they'd been there for a while just like any specialist of any kind of medical practice he had his own office and he had his own waiting room and people would wait for him to come in or for a nurse to come and receive them and he hired a reupholsterer an upholsterer to come in and reupholster the chairs and the upholsterer told dr friedman before he did any work you've got to see this i have never seen anything like this in my entire career so the upholsterer brought dr freeman out into the waiting room and he said look at where the where is on this chair instead of the wear on the chairs being in the back against the back rest the wear on the chairs was on the edge it was on the front of the seat and the upholstery said he'd never seen that because most people you know they kick back and they lean back in a chair but that wasn't the case the main period the main place of wear on these chairs was on the front and they came to the conclusion that the reason for that was because as people were waiting on the cardiologist they were sitting literally on the edge of their seat i want to encourage you really quickly if you're sitting in a chair i'm sitting in a bean bag so i can't really do it"", ""i still have a bit of a cough maybe i should go see a cardiologist maybe maybe it's my heart i doubt it the point that they realized is that as people were waiting for the cardiologist they were probably feeling very anxious because they were worried about what the cardiologist would tell them because maybe their heart wasn't functioning correctly so they would wait on the edge of their seat and dr friedman said a quote that i think really explains the whole point of this video he said i wonder if people are anxious because they're at the cardiologist or are they at the cardiologist because of their anxiety what's the point here the position of our hearts and our souls and our minds and our bodies as we wait has a whole lot to do with how pleasant the weight is as the philosopher rascal flatts once said life is a highway it's not necessarily a destination because believe me i've been on a lot of highways and i've gotten to a lot of destinations and you've probably experienced the same thing you look back and you realize that 99 of the journey was the journey and the final 1 was just kind of where you got the trophy to say that you've done it how does this tie into cryptocurrency because in the title i told you guys this is how i became a millionaire in cryptocurrency and here's the point of this entire video in the same way that dr friedman postulated that perhaps the people who are at the cardiologist because of their anxiety because of how they wait i think a lot of damage will come to us as cryptocurrency traders and investors based on how we wait what do i mean by that i've been in cryptocurrency for four and a half years i've made 80 of the money i've ever made in cryptocurrency in the last 12 months seriously i made in 10 days what i made in the first two years this year just so you know that's what wading looks like the grass is not greener on the other side the grass is greener where you water it i have watered the grass of

game but it does require the work to be put in sure there are other avenues to make money running business doing Drop Shipping something like that and the lessons that we're talking about here

next decade if we want the best decades in investing history from wealth generation whether it's in AI or whatever else and yes of course crypto the coming years are going to be colossal now that

five-year expected peg ratio of 2.18 and a price to book ratio of 4.78 the current profit margin is 22.91 and they have a return equity of 29.15 they're sitting on total cash of 19.27 billion dollars and they have a current ratio of 1.43 the dividend payout ratio is 53.19 which is pretty decent analysts are rating cisco as a 2.5 meaning it is between a buy and a hold and the average endless price target is 55.17 which is just over 10 higher than the current price of 45.89 so cisco recently reported earnings where the company's announcements beat anna's estimates resulting in the six percent leap in the value of csco the company also saw revenue rising year over year from 49.8 billion dollars to 51.6 billion dollars as well as a year-over-year growth in operating income from 12.8 billion last year to 14 billion dollars this year and it makes perfect sense cisco is a tech company designing valuable software and hardware for other people to complete tasks and projects on their computer"", ""but anyway in contrast to UPS ADM actually reported some pretty solid numbers for their most recent quarter with Revenue in line with expectations and a Beat on earnings per share yet they are still down about six and a half percent in the last month so a bigger drop than the first two companies we've seen and then year to date they are down a whopping 19 cheese and as I'm sure you can imagine this puts them extremely close to their 52-week lows we can see on the right hand side of the screen there and the valuation overall is looking pretty attractive looking at the PE Ratio there 10 and a half really nice p e ratio love to see that and this is also 22 and a half percent below the five year average and scrolling down looking at their price to book it's sitting at 1.64 which in its own right is a nice price to book with that said it is 7.6 above the five year average we won't read too much into that I really like the price to book where it's at and the price to cash flow is looking great as well 9.2 sitting nice and low there in the single digits now regarding the dividend out of the three companies we've talked about so far I will say these are the least exciting at least in terms of yield and dividend growth rate as you can see in both departments it really doesn't jump off the screen at you I mean the yield is only two and a half percent the five year growth rate is only 5.3 percent but what they lack in yield and growth rate they certainly make up for inconsistency and reliability because according to Seeking Alpha they've been growing this dividend for the last almost 30 years but I actually don't think this is quite accurate I do believe and correct me if I'm wrong in the comments I do believe Archer Daniel's mid lid is a dividend King"", ""but they also have a very strong pipeline coming down the line the medical device segment also known as Medtech is also expected to return to growth after taking a breather during those pandemic years Johnson Johnson currently has a market cap of 401 billion dollars over the past 12 months the stock is down 14 percent and year to date it is down 13 percent in fact Shares are trading very close to their 52-week low giving investors a great opportunity to add to this Healthcare conglomerate we are talking about a company that has a safer credit rating than the US government if that's saying anything in terms of the dividend Johnson Johnson has paid a growing dividend for more than 60 consecutive years the company currently yields a dividend of 3.1 percent and they have a five-year dividend growth rate of 5.7 percent with the stock trading near the 52-week low let's take a look at where that puts the company's valuation analysts are looking for 2023 EPS of 10.65 cents per share which equates to a 2023 earnings multiple of 14.5 times for comparative purposes Johnson Johnson has traded at an average multiple of 17.7 times over the past five years and 17.2 times over the past decade making now an opportune time to add to jnj the third dividend stock on our list today is United Healthcare Group stock ticker UNH United Healthcare is another carryover from our May picks as the stock really didn't move all that much in the last month which is giving us another up opportunity to dip our toes into this great stock for those of you that are unaware the Dow Jones Industrial Average is actually a price weighted index unlike the S&P500 which is weighted based on market caps""]"

to learn card tricks but to learn a valuable skill that you could then apply on something like maybe fiverr.com or upwork.com which i'm not sponsored to promote or talk about i should be though but if you want to learn a skill the easiest one is the one that you're most passionate about the second easiest and arguably most useful one is tip number five and step number five learn video production doesn't matter whether you're a card expert or you're a dj who likes to twirl it spin it a photographer an accountant a real estate investor does not matter all of these people have in common one thing they learned how to use video to send their thoughts and messages to as many people as possible and as we go forward in this crazy world where online businesses and brands continue to grow and make millions of dollars the one thing that you can learn that is the most important thing is to communicate your message to millions of people and the easiest way to do that is with video and it's going to exponentially elevate every single thing you do want to get a job make a video resume that's literally how my friend ekaterina was able to land a six-figure job with l'oreal by making a video resume with a magic trick and that company's logo and branding and one of the executives for the company saw the video resume tweeted that out and hired her on the spot i actually still have that video interview with her where she taught the exact trick but i never put the video together because i was so afraid and self-conscious of what people might think of me that i never released it so if you want to see it definitely let me know but making a video of anything puts you one step ahead of everybody else step number six become a social media slash content creator let's roll our eyes everybody for those cringy words become an influencer but you don't need to actually be a social media personality you don't even need to appear in your own videos and it really doesn't cost anything to get started assuming you know how to make videos and you have something like a smartphone to record videos on and remember social media doesn't even involve being on video because you can also have something like creative writing writing a blog writing a book if you want to do a blog they're a little bit harder to get started because it's so saturated but if you can leverage the video part to invite people to come to your blog you'll have an easier time what it does cost a lot of though is confidence so if you can get over your sense of self-importance and your fear of failure which comes from fear of judgment then you'll do amazing because remember when's the last time you thought about what your friends are doing in terms of failure or success or in terms of what kind of brands they're wearing probably never they think the same about you""]"

let's say I've had a few dozen different announcements about increased trade for example in Chinese yuan in international trade China for example is now settling more trade internationally in the Chinese Yuan than in the US dollar countries all over the world from Brazil to Argentina to Pakistan the UAE to Russia and more they're getting on the Yuan train baby China's economy is set to overtake the USA as soon as 2028 the brics group that's Brazil Russia India China and South Africa is even discussing launching their own currency as a currency used as a settlement currency for trade Bloc members and we have 19 more countries looking to join the brics group including the world's biggest oil and food and Manufacturing producers I think it would be Folly to Simply dismiss the idea of dedolarization outright or some kind of conspiracy as for example Dave Ramsey called it recently remember the only thing that gives the dollar or really any Fiat money its value is is the belief in its value and that is being questioned right now with the International Community the USA is 32 trillion dollars in debt that's a debt which only gets worse in fact the debt is so bad that now the interest payments are the number one line item on the U.S budget the currency is being debased at an incredible rate right now another eight trillion dollars could be trented just for the banking crisis alone now add in that the dollar of course has been used as a weapon too many times against too many countries in the world and they're starting to get a bit tired of it right these countries are sick of the USA dictating terms to them they want to be more independent remember no currency has ever lasted as a reserve currency forever the average lifespan in fact of a reserve currency is 94 years the dollar has been around as the global Reserve currency for 99 years now tick tock tick tock so if it is not a conspiracy theory that the dedolarization trend is here if there the global trends of money the global Transit demographics the global trends of political power are indeed moving away from Washington and thus the dollar then how can investors prepare before we discuss that I want to let you know about my weekly crypto newsletter it's called wealth Mastery and look every single issue is jam-packed full of money making Alpha my team"", ""South Africa was then subsequently added to the group in 2010 although the coining of the term brick back in 2001 was mostly semantics since then we've seen a stronger Alliance start to form with these nations working together in an economic sense to help Foster stronger global economic terms for these countries today brics countries account for 42 of the global population and 32 percent of global GDP G7 which is regarded as the opposing political Alliance consists of the country's Canada France Germany Italy Japan the United Kingdom and the United States has now started to wane indominance compared to Bricks as you can see from the graph in front of you brics dominance in terms of the total GDP share is starting to flip the share of the G7 as the brics Nations continuously gain power but why does it matter if these nations gain power well because they have an alliance and they're strategically working together to implement measures to better their own currencies Financial Futures but one of the ways that they are doing this is by accepting de-dollarization and starting to settle trade payments in varying currencies back in 2014 Russia and China signed a deal to bypass the US dollar they no longer wanted to rely on the US dollar for international trade and investment the trend is called de-dollarization we are witnessing a rapid shift away from US dollars in international trade we can see this because China's Yuan has replaced the dollar as the most traded currency in Russia China and France have even completed the first Yuan settled LNG trade signaling the end of the use of the dollar for energy trades we've seen China and Brazil pledge to use their own currencies to pay for trade deals and even Saudi Arabia is now entering a trade alliance with China Russia India Pakistan and four Central Asian Nations but the most crazy thing of all is that the brics nations want to develop their own rival currency to the US dollar now whether this will be a success or not no one knows but what we do know is that they're actively working on ways to develop a new currency together and we can see politically their Alliance is only growing stronger now this August in South Africa the brics nations are set to meet to discuss the potential implementation of a new currency so things appear to be ramping up very quickly for the legitimacy of a potential rival currency to the US dollar the leader of China Chi Jinping and Vladimir Putin recently met in Moscow listen to the final few sentences of their Exchange to Improvement"", ""No in fact a lot of stars need to align for this to happen but really a lot of it's about the decline of the US dollar over time and of course really of all Fiat currencies is going to be a major driving factor in seeing that go price go up and one world leader in particular he has had enough of the US dollar and that is of course Vladimir Putin he's been doing his best to build the yellow brick road toward a new Reserve currency created by a group of country called brics earlier this year he announced that Brazil Russia India China and South Africa the brics group are working on a new basket-based Reserve currency there's also interest from other countries who are also wanting to de-dollarize countries like Egypt turkey Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia one of the big wild cards here all wanting to join the brics group the issue of creating an international Reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of their countries it's currently being worked out and gold is part of the plan Putin said it the brics business Forum that we are ready to openly work with all fair partners of five countries are also trying to create an alternative mechanism for international humans he added the case for why the brics countries would use gold it's pretty gosh darn simple more monetary Freedom they want to receive a solid currency that they can control or at least have a larger sayover in return for their goods and of course to avoid sanctions so they can transact freely without the Western countries dictating their moves the head of ing Chris Turner said safety liquidity in return make a great Reserve currency which is why bricks could potentially look toward adding gold into that basket if they're worried about the path of sanctions and the increasing weaponization of the dollar they like Russia might prefer to move into gold now this could definitely be a strong possibility here Russia of course is the third leading gold producer in the world so as of course no surprise that over the decades it has dramatically increased its gold reserves it's also tell telling that these countries are already dabbling into the world of crypto and of course of Central Bank digital currencies these countries went out of the U.S dollar system is it possible we could get a gold-backed stable coin in the future in the forms of a brics currency certainly interesting food for thought and of course that's all happening at the same time that Russia is about to allow Bitcoin for international payments so it's a very interesting coincidence if you will now the second reason that gold could boom in the same reason the Bitcoin can boom and those other store value assets right is because of increased demand from central banks around the world you see gold does well in recessions as we see investors turning to gold for its perceived safety it has produced positive gains in five out of the seven last recessions now as fears have been escalating over last year central banks have been preparing for the worst demand for gold has increased all over the world from central banks and particular we're seeing huge buying sprees according to the world gold Council demand for gold increased by 28 percent in 2022 central banks have been boosting their reserves big time with gold almost as if never before Q3 2022 saw a 55-year high demand for gold from central banks with them buying a record 399 tons worth of gold around 20 billion dollars worth that's almost double the previous record during the same period from back in 2018.""]"

was $8 a coin $1000 in sweet theorem at that time would have netted you 125 eth1 25 aetherium which at the current value would be 110,000 dollars and if the projected price of aetherium hits three to five thousand dollars a coin after Caspar and Plasma have been released you'd be looking at three hundred and seventy five to six hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars of returns after eighteen months from an original $1000 in vested that's not quite 1 million but you guys get the picture the typical amount of time it seems to take in order to get to the million dollar return I know it sounds crazy in cryptocurrencies is around 12 to 24 months if you are into the correct project even if you're just in it to make 100,000 this is even easier because this could have all been achieved with aetherium Cardno ripple like coin lumens or even iota and a six to nine month period with $1000 haven't been thrown into them so you're left with a few options and it kind of comes down to either placing your money into larger coins which I would not say just at this point because the thousand dollars won't do much $1000 into Bitcoin or aetherium will not give you a six-figure return anytime soon or you find new smaller projects again this is why I talk about certain coins when they're new and the price is still low and before I forget what's really good is to look at a website called WWI CEO stats stas calm on the left side it'll show you a list of certain things click on the where it says ROI since ICO and prepare to be amazed it shows you exactly how much all these ICO coins have grown since their inception but the point is there isn't one way to become a millionaire or to make six figures in crypto the trick is as of now finding a lasting project and putting your money into it that's literally it if you have more than $1000 this will obviously accelerate the growth now this doesn't just mean to just dump your cash inches any coin pay close attention to coins that are worth less than 50 cents or even less than that with less than a billion coins in circulation they also have someone major backing their project big names behind projects tend to cause a dramatic rise in value especially if they're associated with etherium or have someone who has worked with Ripple with the etherium team or it was a former developer for Bitcoin this method has worked for just about every single coin in the top 20 if you do the math even better the last thing is if you want to be more active or speed up the process you can learn day trading which I know sounds daunting to a lot of people when I've told them before"", ""I know the Temptation is so strong with crypto go all in as soon as you can but this temptation should be resisted you need to take your time and as to how much to invest in crypto as a total dollar sum really that comes down to you and of course your personal finance is the size of your portfolio as well as your risk tolerance to getting exposure to crypto and the golden rule of course to remember with crypto is never invest more than you can afford to lose because you always need to think this keep this in the back Your Mind Investing in prep crypto if I woke up tomorrow and my wallet has been hacked will I be okay if the answer is no then you're investing too much the next thing I want to address is how often to buy and really when to buy crypto not for many investors a nice passive approach to investing is probably going to work best so you just have an auto buy for 100 bucks a Bitcoin every Friday as an example rain or shine just dollar cost averaging think for the long term let's say that you have a bigger sum that you want to invest and you want to do it fast when should you make that big purchase when should you go all in again not super advised but you know some people are going to do that well the ideal time is when markets are low obviously when asset prices are significantly down and fear is high and everyone is saying that crypto is done for it's a scam and it's going to zero you can also of course look for oversold readings on key technical indicators such as the RSI to try and help find good entries conversely you do not want to buy at new all-time highs when prices have just pumped by hundreds or sometimes thousands of a percent that's a dangerous time to buy when greed is high is a time of danger when everyone's feeling like I'm a genius seeing people posting a picture of the Rolexes and the new cars danger signs warning signs and the media is talking about crypto as the new paradigm of money it's the worst time to buy it's the highest risk time and the lowest reward potential time so be warned of that reality because unfortunately that is when most people are going to want to buy into the cryptocurrency markets now let's talk about how much of your total portfolio should go into crypto again everyone needs to answer this for themselves I can't say three percent that's the number ten percent that's the number but Studies have shown that just one percent of your total portfolio in just Bitcoin can actually see you dramatically outperform these 60 40 stock Bond portfolios so you can do 59 40 and one percent Bitcoin for example some investors obviously much Bolder younger investors that want to make it big they go 100 crypto is seen by many as the best way to create wealth quickly personally I like to diversify profits out of crypto into things like stocks and metals and the thing to keep in mind with crypto is that it is risky it is volatile and putting too much money into crypto"", ""of course as soon as you do the crypto market recovers causing you to pile back into your previous positions at a more expensive price here's what you can do instead start by checking the full context of what the regulator or politician actually said since many mainstream media outlets will take things out of context to get clicks next ask yourself whether this individual has the power to crack down on cryptocurrency in the way they're proposing and whether their constituents and sponsors would even back such a decision more often than not you'll find that these are nothing more than empty threats and that the same folks on wall street who secured their job in the first place would never let them follow through with a crypto crackdown never mind the fact that a crypto crackdown is very unpopular among voters these days if you're wondering just how bullish institutions are on cryptocurrency you can check out my video about what's next for the crypto market using the link i'm not even going to say it you know where it is in the description the eighth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked relates to the seventh and that's to sell your crypto because the crypto market is crashing the advocates of this advice typically argue that it's best to sell while you're ahead before you end up in the red well in my experience the advocates of this approach are your concerned friends and family specifically your mum more often than not when you follow this advice the crypto market tends to rally as soon as you sell and you're left with an unwanted capital gain that's going to be a pain to explain to the taxman here's what you can do instead start by looking at other indicators besides the price to assess the current state of the crypto market this includes the balance of btc on exchanges the fear and greed index open interest on derivatives products and any upcoming crypto milestones that could cause a crypto market reversal next estimate the worst case scenario for your portfolio and ask yourself if that's something you're able to handle financially and psychologically if you think you can't then reduce your exposure to the point that you feel comfortable if you think you can then set aside some cash to buy the dip if you dare if you need help with that you can refer to my video about how to buy the dip which is in the usual place the ninth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is any advice related to specific events or dates for when a coin or token will supposedly pump or dump usually this advice is given for up-and-coming cryptocurrencies that are allegedly going to list on an exchange partner with a publicly listed company or complete an often pointless upgrade on a particular day hoping to turn a quick profit you take the bait and wait only to find that the price does the exact opposite of what you expected leaving you holding the bag or sitting on the sidelines as prices rise here's what you can do instead start by being aware that investors tend to front run these kinds of announcements as a result the pump or dump tends to occur well in advance and nothing happens on the actual day that's if you're lucky mind you next try and find out whether the event upgrade or announcement could be bullish for the crypto project in the long term if it is then an uneventful reaction to the development could be the perfect time to start allocating for future gains in a perfect world you'd be able to allocate just before these gains occur and while there's no guaranteed way of doing this there are a few ways you can increase your chances more about that in the description the tenth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to go all in on crypto because you believe the current financial system is about to fail this is a very popular idea in the crypto community""]"

in two different liquid staking protocols because they're liquid staking protocols we still have tokens that we can contribute to a lending protocol let's take a look at that next over on Soul end with msol and St Soul Assets Now on our wallet we can deposit both of these into the lending contract selecting the max amount will deposit all of the M sold that we've just created taking a look at Soul scan we can see how much gas we are needing to pay for these types of transactions here we see that it is way under one sole per in fact it looks like we could perform as many as a thousand transactions without exceeding one's Soul definitely a very cost effective ecosystem at the current block space demand we're turning again to Soul end we can contribute our St soul that we just created as well coming up next we're going to take a usdc loan against the assets that we're holding on Solan The Hope here is that we don't need to aggressively monitor our usdc position because our staked assets are earning interest on the back end and therefore becoming more valuable if our collateral becomes more valuable at a rate faster than our interests that were accruing on the loan then we don't need to worry about paying it back anytime soon selecting usdc then the borrow button at the top and an amount of fifteen dollars we can borrow 15 usdc through the protocol finally scrolling down we can see our current asset positions including some positions we set up previously but the two we just set up are right here along with the loan position we just accessed with usdc in our wallet we're ready to participate in some leveraged trading but to do this we need a leveraging protocol scrolling down to the options listed by defy Lama for Solana we do come across one labeled derivatives and that's drift here on drift we see a trading interface rather similar to what we saw when working with GMX before as you can see we have access to leverage positions here via slider as well as standard trades now in order to participate in trading on drift we do need to deposit our assets to the protocol depositing the assets does incur a fee but once they're deposited we can proceed with our leveraged trading options here we have specific leverage options based on the amount of assets we've deposited to our wallet as we can see our maximum Leverage is 10x which would allow us an 150 dollar position based on the 15 and collateral that we've deposited this is a bit strong for what we want to execute right now instead we're going to favor that same 5x position that we did in testing the other day selecting long we're able to set up our long position and here we can see that our current liquidation price on this position is 23 953 should we drop that far then we will be liquidated and lose our collateral assets however should the price increase then we're going to see that leverage working in our favor well there you have it a complex yet reasonable strategy for diversifying sole assets on Solana and producing a Bitcoin long position using entirely permissionless means it's a great solution for anybody who's looking for a censorship resistant alternative to something like buybid now that they've introduced kyc other options can also be explored with leveraged trading including incorporating different asset strategies and things of that nature of course be careful and watch your liquidation prices if you're going to execute strategies that way however it's clear to see that there's a lot of opportunity still available on Solana as we enter the next Bull run nobody really knows what's going to happen with total value locked across all these different chains the truth is we may see Solana re-emerge as a market leader and on the other hand we may see it continue to decline before a Resurgence at the end of the day it all depends on how much economic activity the network experiences and if you're part of that early activity then you stand to reap much greater rewards later on see everybody in the next video"", ""so next stop we're bridging to ethereum l2s these networks are a little different because the ethereum that we're moving over will actually become gas on the L2 this is not true for the other networks we're visiting and because of that we need to separate out our Bridge amount from the amount that we're keeping in the wallet for gas we can do this by checking the block Explorer to see how much we received following the previous Bridge let's take a look next we'll be moving our ethereum between the two most popular layer 2 defy environments on ethereum specifically arbitrum and optimism navigating to Stargate we see that we have a bridge route available here here we want to verify the amount of eth that was received on the arbitrum side after moving from Kronos once verified we can paste that amount into our Bridge interface over on Stargate with the amount specified we're ready to process the bridge transaction select and confirm and monitoring the interface for confirmation after a few minutes we can see that our assets have arrived via Stargate to optimism like with arbitrum we're going to take a look at the fully transferred amount in order to figure out how much we're going to send over to Avalanche here we can see this amount of ethereum coming in through Stargate protocol a little bit ago before we can Bridge our assets to Avalanche we need to swap them for wrapped ethereum assets we can do this using one-inch protocol here we see that slippage is not a factor but there is a transfer fee involved selecting confirm swap we'll swap our eth assets for wrapped eth next we'll return to seller bridge and move the entirety of our wrapped ethereum assets over to Avalanche first approving wrap teeth for spending by seller Bridge once approved we're ready to transfer our assets again confirming the transfer on our metamask wallet once confirmed on optimism we just need to wait for the transaction to confirm on Avalanche as well again this may take a few minutes we made it that was Bridge five we're nearly halfway there it's a great time for us to talk a little bit about how these Bridges work now there are a few different types we have mint and burn as it's often called isonomes call it lock box receipt because because the lock box is where the tokens are stored on the origin Network and the receipt is what you receive on the destination Network representative of the value of that token the other model is interlocking pools of liquidity and that's what we see with multi-chain the protocol we were using earlier in either case though we're processing a transaction on both networks and that's an important aspect to how this works whenever you're bridging you need to wait not only for confirmation of the first transaction but also the confirmation on the destination Network once that's received our assets are available and fully bridged by viewing the black Explorer for Avalanche snowtrace.io we can take a look at our assets as they come through the bridge selecting erc20 token transactions here we see wrapped ethereum removing the filter we're able to see all the incoming transactions for this asset next using Wormhole we can move the wrap teeth that we just transferred over now wrapped eth.e over to Oasis selecting next prompts us to confirm that transaction here we need to select manual payment as we will need to process a transaction using rows in order to complete this bridge selecting approve will approve our current supply of wrapped teeth for transfer we'll select max amount and then next approve once complete we're ready to transfer our assets via portal Bridge select and confirm and then confirming again with our wallet and paying the requested fee once the transaction is complete and with Oasis Emerald Rose in our wallet we're able to redeem the funds on the Oasis Network this is the Oasis Emerald Paradigm an evm layer on Oasis selecting confirm and then signing again with our wallet so that last Bridge transaction moved our eth assets from Avalanche over to Oasis Network actually the Oasis Emerald Paradigm which is the evm layer now that they're there there isn't a lot we can do with them because liquidity is too thin so instead we need to bridge them back luckily we can do this with limited slippage let's take a look taking a look at the Oasis Foundation Oasis emerald block Explorer we're able to see our recent token transfers this includes the wrapped eth.e coming into our wallet selecting the asset wrapped ether through Wormhole we see that we're the first person to use this particular Bridge route in about a year and that there are only 19 addresses holding this particular asset for this reason it's possible that we don't have any other options for our ether on this chain without moving it back through the same Bridge here we again select the max amount before bridging back to Avalanche this time approving our Bridge deep assets again for spending this time by Oasis Network and then selecting the transfer option to complete the transfer finally signing another transaction to redeem the assets back on Avalanche next stop is one of the newest Bridge protocols on the scene squid router we haven't played a lot with Squid router"", ""why but it's not evm it's common to see them launching an evm chain I would consider this generally a bullish sign for a protocol that they're keeping up with the times and looking to innovate wherever possible let's look at the next Bridge step as we continue with assets over on kava now we can move to satellite.money selecting Cava from the origin chain and polygon from the destination chain we'll go ahead and move back over to polygon this time swapping back to wrap teeth here we initiate the swap transaction which is a five stage process signing first with our wallet selecting Max and then next and then approving the bridge transaction fee next we're asked asked to sign one more transaction in order to process the transfer once complete we can see a summary at the bottom and we have an option to make another transfer so here we are back on polygon we've almost reached the end of our massive bridging Expo but we've got one more step to go to put us back on ethereum it's going to be a doozy so let's take a look at this point returning to wallet.polygon.technology we're able to view our Wallet balance on polygon here we can see that our eth assets have returned to our wallet and that we're still holding the majority of them in exploring the different cross-chain protocols available for moving assets from polygon to other networks including back to ethereum in many cases the fee to return our assets to the ethereum mainnet nearly matched the amount that we were holding this was the case with connexed a bridge we didn't use this time but one we have used in the past we had similar issues when exploring new protocols where the ethereum fee took a long time to generate and ultimately was more than the assets we were holding situations where the preview amount was very close to our origin amount indicated that a gas fee needed to be paid in Matic at today's market rate this would be about a 95 gas fee this prompted us to return to Seabridge our original Network used to bridge from ethereum to polygon in order to bridge back the reason being that the final received amount after gas fees does not exceed the balance that we're holding and only uses about half of our resources selecting transfer and then confirm transfer and then confirming with our software wallet processes the bridge transaction selecting pending from the top right allows us to see the transaction in process once complete we can see the bridge amount reflected in our balance with our assets back on ethereum our steps are not quite complete our final procedure in bridging is to turn our remaining eth into native Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain here's how we do that using Thor swap found at app.thoreswap.finance Swap here we have the option to swap native ethereum for Native Bitcoin connecting our metamask wallet first here the maximum amount that we can select is adjusted based on the amount we'll need for gas here we'll paste in a Bitcoin address that we control normally we'd be able to process this swap transaction with limited fees receiving our assets over on the Bitcoin Network unfortunately due to the congestion on bitcoin created by Bitcoin ordinals we're unable to do this at this time as Thor chain has paused Bitcoin withdraws for the time being it's likely that new updates to the Bitcoin blockchain will fix this restoring access to this interoperability method going forward""]"

ex-first wallet are currently working on integrating stacking pools while the rewards for stacking are also not entirely clear they seem to add up to about 10 in btc relative to the dollar value of stx you're stacking if you plan on stacking just be aware that there is a 16-day lock-up period i'll leave resources for stacking in the video description as well shortly after the stacks 2.0 upgrade went live about half a dozen companies signed up to become miners on the network such as foundry digital and block daemon in february stax announced the winners of their clarity smart contract challenge the winner of the advance category was a project called arcadio dao a clone of maker dao that is looking to bring crypto collateralized stable coins to the stax blockchain the winner of the basic category was a magic 8 ball which will generate randomness for the stacks blockchain in addition to eight predictions for people into superstition by march stackers had earned more than and a half million dollars in bitcoin rewards which might have been what enticed the chief strategy officer of coin shares to join the stax foundation a few weeks later the stax foundation announced its accelerator program which provides funding and guidance to any projects building on stacks for the first three months one of the people who will be guiding projects building on stacks is chain link founder sergey nazarov who seems to have a very close relationship with stax founder munib ali the stax accelerator complements the stack foundation's grants program which has reserved over 30 million stx for those contributing to the growth of the stax ecosystem in april the stx token listed on the south korean upbeat exchange which was apparently the sole driver behind its sudden 2x move according to coindesk this is because south korean traders are crazy for altcoins and many of them are also attracted to the btc rewards given by stx stacking speaking of price it's about time we popped open the charts for stx stx is up more than 10x since i covered it last november"", ""[Music] before we get stacking there are some disclaimers that need unpacking if you're looking for

topics you've found i'd love it if you watched from start to finish because the youtube algorithm gives lots of weight to your minutes that's enough of that let's get on with stacks staxx was founded in 2013 by computer scientists munib ali and ryan shea at the university of princeton stax is the product of munib's doctoral thesis which detailed a framework for an internet that could be built around the bitcoin blockchain this framework is called block stack and this was also the original name of the project until it rebranded to stacks in october last year the new york software company that developed stacks also rebranded from block stack pbc to hiro systems pbc and i'll explain why that's significant later on at the conceptual level you can think of stacks as being a layer 2 blockchain for bitcoin like the lightning network the stax blockchain also uses a novel consensus mechanism called proof of transfer that leverages bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus for security proof of transfer is conceptually similar to proof-of-stake as it involves stackers who stack the stx token on the stacks blockchain and earn bitcoin as a reward this bitcoin comes from stax miners who commit btc to the stax blockchain for a chance to mine a block on the stax blockchain and earn stx the btc they commit goes to stackers as stacking rewards the reasoning behind this consensus mechanism is that each btc coin essentially represents mining power from bitcoin's proof-of-work blockchain everything that happens on the stacks blockchain is verifiable on the bitcoin blockchain this doesn't modify or strain the bitcoin network because this information is just regular btc transactions made by stax miners in addition the stax blockchain is smart contract compatible and uses a specialized coding language called clarity that was created with the help of algorand instead of storing the data from its smart contracts on chain smart contract data generated by the stacks blockchain is stored off-chain in a decentralized storage system called gaia all data generated by a user on the stacks blockchain is assigned to their unique identity i.e their wallet address only the holder of the wallet address can access its associated data stored on gaia and give permissions to decentralized applications and third parties to do the same now this only scratches the surface of how stax works and if you want to take a closer look under the hood you can do just that by watching my first video about stacks and the link for that is as ever in the top right although the stax blockchain has technically been live since late 2019 it wasn't until mid-january this year that stacks became a finished product this was marked by the release of stax 2.0 which enabled proof of transfer mining and smart contract functionality on the stacks blockchain it turns out that how proof of transfer works in practice is pretty damn complicated but it seems to be lucrative for both miners and stackers to briefly recap the stx token has halving cycles similar to bitcoins for the first four years the block reward on the stacks blockchain is 1000 stx per block with the current market price of stx this works out to just over two thousand dollars per block plus any transaction fees in that block from the stacks blockchain now if my calculations are correct the amount of btc you'd need to commit to the stacks blockchain to minor block is currently about fifteen hundred dollars that's about a five hundred dollar profit in stx which is not too shabby that said the amount of btc that needs to be committed changes over time since the likelihood of getting chosen to minor block is proportional to how much btc you have committed relative to other minors moreover there is a risk that the btc you commit as a minor could appreciate during the 16 hour time frame it takes to receive your rewards in stx the value of the stx you're waiting for could also fall during that time now on the bright side the hardware requirements to mine stx are extremely low and if you're interested in mining on stacks i'll leave a few resources for you in the video description if you're more of a stacker the amount of stx you have to stack to earn the btc being committed by miners is likewise based on how much stx other stackers are stacking right now the minimum amount of stx you need to stack is 90 000."", ""so props to anyone who got in early to be completely honest though stx hasn't performed nearly as well as other altcoins and its price action also looks quite bizarre i suspect this is for two reasons first the distribution of the stx token is not very equitable even though the stax explorer doesn't actually show you wallet balances it's enough to know that no tokens were sold to the public during the stax ico the entirety of stx's initial supply was split between prived investors the stax foundation hira systems pbc and the project's founders these stx tokens have a fairly aggressive vesting schedule which is set to finish in october this year now given how much stx has appreciated compared to its sale price many of these tokens are probably being sold when you combine this cell pressure with the cell pressure coming from stax miners you need a lot of demand if you want prices to go higher now in theory this demand should be coming from those looking to stack stx and earn bitcoin but the costs required to do this solo are way too high and pooling stx with a third party is neither safe nor convenient for the time being what this means is that we might continue to see suppressed and sideways price action until the fall unless improvements are made to stacking or new dapps create new demand for stx however there seems to be some hope on the technical analysis side stx is printing either a bull flag or an ascending triangle on the daily time frame in either case we will likely see stx spike by 50 cents over the next few days the bearish news here is that when you zoom out on the weekly time frame you can see that people have consistently been taking profits at just above the two dollar mark as denoted by the tall wicks on top this is support for my thesis that cell pressure from miners vcs and founders is suppressing the price action of stx now if you want to learn how to do this with your favorite altcoin be sure to watch my videos about technical analysis and the first episode is hanging up there in the top right in terms of a roadmap staxx no longer has one and that's because the community decides what comes next stax community governance is coordinated by the stax foundation and all upcoming upgrades and milestones can be found on stack's governance github repository it appears that staxx is in the process of implementing fungible and non-fungible token standards which are a prerequisite for serious smart contract functionality and user adoption on that note stax has seemingly struggled with adoption despite having a solid project and raising nearly 100 million dollars in funding this is evident in the amount of stackers which is fewer than 300 for this 16-day cycle now this is concerning because these 300 stackers alone are stacking more than 30 percent of stx's circulating supply according to stacking club the next round of stacking will only see 250 of 3200 stacking slots filled now while i wasn't able to find any up-to-date statistics on how many miners there are right now in a february interview stacks founder munibali mentioned that there were just 46 miners on stacks besides the economic implications of this it also means that the stax blockchain itself is fairly centralized as far as i can tell the real reason why stacks has had such a hard time so far is because of the sec the sale of the stx token in 2019 was actually the first cryptocurrency ico to be sanctioned by the sec in the united states and the stax team went above and beyond to make it happen there's just one small problem and that's that doing the stx sale by the book within the united states meant that stx was automatically designated as a security by the sec without getting into the legal mumbo jumbo one of the side effects of stx being classified as a security is that it cannot be listed for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges inside the united states given that almost all of stack's infrastructure marketing and network effects are within the us a lack of exchange support for the stx token makes it difficult for fans of stacks in the us to participate in its ecosystem as miners stackers or users there is one caveat here and that's that the stax team has been working like mad to convince the sec to change its classification of the stx token from a security to a currency now that stacks 2.0 is live while it wasn't clear to me why stax and hiro systems had rebranded in october this makes a lot of sense when you consider the fact that this rebrand makes it easier for stx to be classified as a currency a green light from the sec seems to be the only thing preventing the buildup of institutional clients and investors in the united states from using stax and stx everything else already seems to be in place case in point coinbase already provides custody for the stx token and multiple u.s exchanges have signaled their readiness to list stx once it's cleared by the sec hirosystems recently filed its final annual report with the sec and has stated that it will no longer handle the stx token as a security now whether the sec feels the same way remains to be seen but once these floodgates are opened the adoption could be unprecedented for starters stax is built around a cryptocurrency that is seeing massive adoption by institutions and investors stax already has hundreds of apps for things like decentralized video streaming accounting and health record sharing most importantly institutions can trust the project because it was built in the united states by people from one of the world's top universities who held a token sale sanctioned by regulators according to stack's founder mani valley the real value that stacks will bring is sustainability to the bitcoin blockchain in 100 years or fewer the last btc will be mined now many have argued that transaction fees alone will be enough of an economic incentive to keep the bitcoin network going after that point however the fees for these transactions would need to be large and the transactions would need to be frequent if fees are large there will be fewer transactions and this would create a negative feedback loop that could kill bitcoin monieb argues that large and frequent transactions on the bitcoin blockchain is exactly what the stacks ecosystem will incentivize through its mining process if he's correct then stacks might actually be what bitcoin needs to maintain long-term security well into the future if you want to learn more about what happens after all the bitcoin is mined and a few of the other ways it could survive without transaction fees i happen to have a video about just that you know where to find it and if you forgot it's in the top right stax is a cryptocurrency project that has struggled to get the attention it deserves after all who wouldn't want to earn btc for securing a decentralized internet built on bitcoin it's a powerful proposition that should attract millions of people inside and outside of crypto""]"

to what your parents have to say about work and money however that same family could be really amazing in terms of their relationships and other things and so if they are look at what they're doing there and emulate that really the whole thing is identify people that are successful in certain areas and then just emulate what they do this is literally a surefire way to see success another thing that seems to happen a lot is people step outside of their circle get hurt and then come back into their circle on one side it makes sense why people do this right humans don't like pain they'll try to avoid pain but on the other side it also doesn't make any sense at all if you look at babies they continue trying to walk until they succeed in the process they'll fall on their butts like a thousand times i just don't get why adults don't have that same perseverance for example the first time you step out of that circle does not need to necessarily mean you succeed at something you can fail it's totally fine but the important part is you don't like come back to your circle and just stay there forever it's actually normal to fail a lot of times before you succeed and one great example is just gonna be like my youtube channel i've been on youtube for i think 14 years now i started a channel in 2008 and my sister and i basically just made music covers i did that for many years didn't see that much success and then in 2013 or 2014 that's when i started to try making a fitness youtube channel that also did not work out totally failed"", ""but when you think about how big the world is the chances of something really amazing coming to you parking itself in your circle is extremely small and so i like to say that luck is actually created right you can actually create your own luck by always looking for opportunities stepping outside of that circle running around learning new things if you do that you are literally a hundred times more likely to find something that makes you a millionaire than if you were to just stay in your circle right same thing with your personal relationships the moment you step out of that circle you are surrounded by a whole new different like group of people you can find people that match your interests you can find more best friends you can find that perfect significant other rather than just staying in your circle and hoping someone comes to you right the whole message here is to really just be proactive and create your own success because the worst thing that you can do is just think that you are special and that things are just going to come directly to you unfortunately i learned the hard way and that's why for so many years while i stood in that circle my life was not really going anywhere also if you've been in the same city for more than a few years then it's time to start considering moving somewhere else making the move from los angeles to costa mesa was one of the best things i've ever done and i actually do credit for a lot of the successes that i've had today of course where you live is where you spend the majority of your time and so that's where your circle is located too every once in a while move somewhere else take a trip do a work vacation or something and that's really going to expand your horizons for example right now my girlfriend"", ""whatever but if they're on a downtrend then that success is not going to last forever whereas the person that's lower on the economic ladder let's say they are continually trending upwards that to me is success and that is why you don't need to be rich to be successful as long as you're continually improving in your work in your relationships in your self-improvement and also in your personal happiness that's what really matters so don't define success in terms of comparing yourself to other people because if you do that you'll never be happy and you'll never be truly successful because there's always going to be someone that's you know making more money more happy having better relationships whatever than you so in this journey of life it's just really important to focus on yourself and your own particular journey i truly believe that the formula to making more money if that's how you want to you know define success relies on all these different key areas of your life so if you can get those things straight making more money is just going to be a byproduct of that so now let's talk a little bit more about why that circle i drew at the start of this video is so important now if you guys look behind me we are at the top of the mountain and we can see for miles and miles if i were to draw a circle right here or go back to that other circle that i drew earlier and i stayed in that circle you probably would think i was crazy right because there's so much stuff to explore in the world well most people they draw a circle around themselves and they just stay within that circle now of course that's a metaphor because you know people don't actually do that but the circle that most people draw around themselves is their comfort zone and when you have this comfort zone around you it's just so easy not to leave it why leave when you can be super comfortable standing right there enjoying your current environment doing the things that you're currently doing you know like it doesn't make any sense but for me i like to look at it in terms of this right like i could be exploring so many things i could be trying new opportunities i can be looking for new business ideas i could be getting out of my comfort zone and doing things that actually are able to help improve my life but if i choose not to i'm just going to be standing right here i can enjoy the view but i can never fully experience the things i'm seeing when you're in that circle you can't really move right you can sort of walk back and forth pace around but the maximum you can move is like five feet and the world or your barriers of opportunity are limitless so the key concept here is you can't stand you can't pace back and forth you need to actively move you need speed and so if i remove that circle of comfort i can actually start walking i can start running i can check out new locations""]"

bad or super expensive food similar with luxury clothing i used to view expensive food as sort of a luxury and status symbol now not so much on the other side of the spectrum i also know the importance of not eating really bad food so really there's a whole scale in the types of food you can eat on a day-to-day basis on the very left is really crappy foods like mcdonald's and processed foods and on the very right we have things like the french laundry where a single meal can be you know close to a thousand dollars per person zooming in on the very left all this really cheap stuff these types of foods are all processed in efficient factories for example your average one dollar box of mac and cheese it just contains wheat artificial cheese and chemical flavors slightly to the right we have places like mcdonald's and other fast food now i will say that every day more than one in three u.s adults eat some type of restaurant fast food it's a really big reason why health is starting to deteriorate in this country then you have things like fruit meats fish which are between let's say a dollar and ten dollars a pound the process to get these natural foods processed and then to the store is just much more expensive and that's why they cost a lot more especially if you look at it per calorie now if you take a look at some of the data on how much millionaires spend on groceries you can actually see that they don't spend that much money about one-third of millionaires surveyed spend less than 300 each month on groceries about 64 spend less than 450 and then less

our first module a stock is basically part ownership in a company which is why people often refer to stocks as shares the smallest trade that can be made in a particular stock is for one share which is what the price represents in the quote window that we covered in our last lesson similarly as you will notice if you look in your quote window the smallest move a stock can make is one penny per share as represented by the second decimal place in the stock quote generally traders trade in 100 share increments when trading stocks which is referred to as a round lot it is possible to trade less than 100 shares referred to as an odd lot or more than 100 shares that are not in increments of 100 which is referred to as a mix lot depending on where you are trading there may be additional fees for trading sizes other than 100 share increments so be sure to check with your broker so let's say for example that microsoft is currently trading at twenty five dollars a share and you feel from your analysis that the price is going to rise to thirty dollars a share in this case you would buy to enter the trade as you want to profit from the price increase of the stock let's say for example that you buy 100 shares which will thus cost you one hundred shares times twenty five dollars a share which equals twenty five hundred dollars plus commissions which we'll cover in a later lesson if the price of the stock goes up by five dollars a share to thirty dollars then you have earned one hundred shares times the five dollar per share gain which equals five hundred dollars pretty simple while many people are familiar with the above example of buying stock what many people are not as familiar with is the concept of selling stock short let's say for example that your analysis is telling you that instead of the price of microsoft stock rising five dollars a share from twenty five dollars a share to thirty dollars it is going to fall five dollars a share from twenty five dollars to twenty dollars per share just as you can profit from the price of a stock going up in value by buying you can profit from the stock going down in value by selling the stock you do this by barring the number of shares that you wish to sell short through your brokerage selling them in the open market and then buying them back when you're ready to exit the trade let's look at how this would work in our with our example of microsoft outlined above since i think the value of the stock is going to fall from 25 to 20 i sell 100 shares of microsoft at twenty five dollars crediting my account one hundred shares times twenty five dollars per share or twenty five hundred dollars if i am correct and the value of the stock falls from twenty five dollars to twenty dollars then i can buy the stock i have borrowed and and sold in the market back for 100 shares times the 20 per share price of the stock which amounts to two thousand dollars as i originally sold the one hundred shares of stock at twenty five hundred dollars and now i'm able to buy the same 100 shares of stock back for two thousand to replace the shares i borrowed i have just made 500 on my trade on the flip side of this if i sell the stock short at 25 dollars and the price instead rises to thirty dollars per share where i exit the trade i have now had to buy back the stock i sold for twenty five hundred dollars at a price of three thousand in this case i would have lost five hundred dollars on the trade because the price moved up which in the case of a short sale is a move against the trader that's our lesson for today in our next lesson we'll look at the different types of orders which can be used to enter and exit the market starting with the most basic order type the market order so i hope to see you in that lesson as always if there are any questions or comments please leave them in the comment section below and good luck with your trading"", ""then i can initiate new positions and i do not have to put up additional funds or sell securities to meet a margin call next let's take a look at a short stock example the first thing to understand about shorting stocks is that a margin account is required to do so because in a short sale you are borrowing stock from someone else and selling it in the open market the second thing that is important to understand is that when you sell a stock short the proceeds from the short sale are deposited into your account which increases your cash balance because of this the margin requirement for short selling is one hundred and fifty percent initial margin and one hundred and thirty percent margin on the thinkorswim platform when shorting stocks under normal market conditions because the short sale increases the cash in your account by one hundred percent of the sale price of the stock however the amount of a traders account that he or she must put up in - remains 50% initiation and 30% maintenance just as in the long stock example in other words you know because they're able to use the stock the money from the start they've just sold it doesn't actually increase the margin requirements by 100% for our short sale example I'm going to sell 5,000 shares of Microsoft stock which at the time I took this screenshot had a market price of 21 dollars and 22 cents as shown on the platform this makes the dollar value of this position one hundred and six thousand one hundred dollars since I sold this stock short the one hundred six thousand and one hundred dollar proceeds from the sale are deposited into my account bringing the balance of the account to the cash amount of ninety seven thousand one hundred and five dollars and fifty cents plus one hundred six thousand one hundred which equals two hundred and three thousand two hundred and five dollars and fifty cents because of the recent market volatility here again both the initial and the maintenance margin are one hundred and fifty percent for this stock which equals one hundred and six thousand times 1.5 or one hundred and fifty nine thousand one hundred and fifty dollars to get the cash amount available to issue to initiate new positions I simply subtract the one hundred and fifty nine thousand one hundred and fifty dollars from the two hundred and three thousand two hundred and five fifty balance of my account which gives me forty four thousand fifty five dollars and fifty cents that's a lesson for today and that wraps up our series of lessons on trading stocks on margin in our next lesson we're going to wrap up our module on the rules and regulations surrounding trading stocks with a look at something which is known as the pattern day trading rule so I hope to see you then as always if there any questions are comments please feel free to leave them in the comment section below and good luck with your trading"", ""hi folks dave waring here again with inform trades dot-com and today's lesson of the day in our last lesson we finished up our module on the logistics of stock trading with a look at how to place a trailing stop in today's lesson we're going to start a new module covering the basics of trading stocks on margin so let's get started like the concept of short-selling trading on margin is one of the more confusing concepts that traders encounter regarding the logistics of trading trading on margin very simply involves the use of borrowed money from a traders broker which increases buying power and allows traders to amplify both their profits and losses to help understand the concept of margin let's start with an example that many people are more familiar with getting a mortgage to buy an apartment for this example let's say there are two people who are buying apartments in the same building each of which costs $100,000 the first buyer in our example pays the full 100 thousand dollar purchase price in cash the second person does not have the full 100,000 so instead he puts down 20,000 of the purchase price and obtains the rest of the $100,000 cost of the apartment by obtaining a loan for eighty thousand dollars from his local bank next let's say that over the course of the next year the price of both apartments goes up by five thousand dollars to one hundred and five thousand dollars while both people in our example have a five thousand dollar gain on their apartment the percentage return on their money is quite different for the buyer we put up the full one hundred thousand dollar purchase price the five thousand dollar increase in the value of the property represents a five percent gain on his money for the buyer who put up only twenty thousand dollars however that same five thousand dollar increase in the value of the property represents a twenty five percent gain on his money now that we understand this we can see the reason why some traders choose to trade on margin so they can try to amplify the gains on their capital when trading in exactly the same manner as I have outlined here with these two apartments while the ability to amplify ones gains through the use of borrowed money is certainly an advantage it is also important to understand that trading on margin is a sword that cuts both ways in other words just as the use of margin amplifies the gain as you can see using the above example if the price goes down by five thousand instead losses are amplified as well so to take a stock trading example let's say that we have two traders each of whom buy 100 shares of stock that is trading at $10 per share the first trader trades an account without the right to use margin which is known as a cash account so he needs the entire ten thousand dollar purchase price of the stock available in his account in order to buy the stock the second trader trades an account with the right to use margin which is known as a margin account this trader is able to borrow up to fifty percent of the purchase price of the stock so he only needs to have five thousand dollars in his account in order to purchase the same ten thousand dollar stock if the price of the stock trades up from ten to eleven then both traders have a $1 per share gain on their one hundred shares for a total gain of $100 while this represents a one percent gain on the first traders account it represents double the return or a two percent gain on the second traders margin account to simplify the example here I have not included Commission costs or the cost of the interest traders Pail margin accounts which we will cover in coming lessons also keep in mind here that if the stock had traded down by one dollar to nine dollars instead then just as the percentage gain on the margin traders account was double the margin traders loss in this example would be double as well because trading on margin increases the risk on a traders account there are additional rules and regulations that we must be aware of surrounding the use of margin which we will learn about in our next lesson""]"

CIT Bank Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Ally Bank I'm not sponsored or paid by any of them to tell you this the second way to make sure that your bank accounts are actually making money is to put them to use by buying a bond now you might have seen some scary headlines like 2022 was the worst year on record for bonds even if you go back 250 years 2022 was the worst so why on Earth would anyone suggest buying a bond you see this is why I don't trust YouTubers that's a good idea you shouldn't trust them especially if they do magic tricks but in all seriousness bonds if done the right way cannot lose you money and this is because all a bond is is you lending money to someone else that's someone else in my opinion should almost always be the US government because the US government has never defaulted on its loans it has always paid that money back and once you loan that money out that Bond pays you into interest every six months or twice a year now every single bond has its own maturity date aka the amount of time you loan someone your money for and once that Bond reaches the full maturity date you get to get all of your money back aka the principal investment plus all of the interest that you've made from it the longer you loan your money out for the higher the interest rate will be but that's not always the case now my favorite Bond right now is the series I bonds which are tied to the measure of inflation or the CPI last year they were paying 9.6 interest which is insane so I put in the maximum allowed ten thousand dollars into it and now the money's sitting there and it's collecting interest I made a step-by-step video on how you can buy it from the government website at treasury direct.gov because it's not super simple or straightforward but the cool part is that after 12 months I get all of my initial principal value out plus the interest and that's why I don't care what this bond is worth on the open market because I'm not buying it to trade or sell ahead of time now if I don't want to put away my money for 12 months at the time there's a shorter term bond that is the six month treasury bond and right now that is yielding a juicy 4.8 percent which is still higher than 99 of any savings accounts that I've ever seen so this is a great way that if you know you don't need all of this checking account cash you can just put it away into the six month Bond and now it's generating interest so after six months you get all the money back plus the interest it's a win-win trick number three to start saving money really fast is to maximize your 401k employer contribution matches this is a 100 return on investment now if you're employed you already know this trick"", ""so why should you guys buy them right now well right now investors are largely feeling unsure or bearish about the current stock market so investing your money in shares may not be the safest option at the moment because of this negative market sentiment it seems like bonds and i bonds in particular are a really reliable place to put your money right now because yeah the government always needs money from the people but here's the problem the feds continue to increase interest rates which will cause bond prices to falter this is destroying the bond market as we speak for example the vanguard total bond market index fund admiral shares has been suffering heavily this past year on top of that we're looking at historically high inflation rates which also diminishes the value of most low yield bonds fortunately this is why we go to series i bonds to save the day and the first question that you guys are probably asking is why are series i bonds inflation proof so these are inflation proof because they pay you a fixed rate of return as well as a variable rate of return that changes as economic inflation changes too and what's even crazier is that series i bonds provide guaranteed returns which also essentially makes them crash proof this feels like a cheat code in the bond market but these assets are fully real and perfectly legal in fact they're literally sponsored by the us treasury so now how do series i bonds work before investing anything it's really important to understand what you're investing into and how it works so basically with series i bonds you're earning monthly interest that is added to your bond every six months more specifically you are earning a fixed interest rate that doesn't change plus an inflation adjustment rates that changes by annually now this interest rate can build up for 30 years or up until the point you sell at your bonds now before we talk about the things that make series i bond so great let's first discuss the disadvantages and trust me guys there are not"", ""and yeah historically 10 and your t-notes have been really sought after they've been a great balance between risk and reward and they're heavily used as a benchmark for setting mortgage rates and then finally we have t bills like I mentioned earlier these are much shorter term investments and right now with t-built interest rates at around five percent they are an extremely attractive investment option now there are three main different ways that you guys can invest in treasury bills the first is directly through the government by buying on Treasury direct this is run directly by the US Department of Treasury and on this platform it's very easy to buy hold and redeem treasury debt Securities the second way to buy t-bills is through the secondary Market you can buy tables on most of the main online Brokers for example Vanguard Charles Schwab Fidelity TD Ameritrade and more and all these platforms they offer new issue treasuries without fees later on this video I'll show you guys exactly how that works and the third option is instead of buying T bills directly you can invest in ETFs that actually just invest in t-build so let's talk a little bit more about Treasurer direct this is really great if you don't have a brokerage account and are not looking to set one up it's also good if you're looking to hold treasuries until maturity because you aren't allowed to actually exchange them on Treasury direct itself it's also a great place if you want a safe virtually risk-free platform for Investments and if you want full ownership and control over your treasuries here's what the treasure direct website looks like I'm not going to show you guys exactly how to you know buy a t build step by step on this platform but super easy and we'll link a tutorial down the description below now like I mentioned earlier another way to buy treasury bills is through an online broker and this might be good for you if you want to buy and actually sell treasuries instead of actually waiting to the maturity date it's also good if you want to use your own treasuries towards the buying power of other Securities you can purchase from a higher pool of treasuries that are being sold right before maturity or it's also good if you don't want to open up a treasury direct account see a lot of you guys might already have access to an online broker like Vanguard or Charles Schwab and""]"

you do scroll out here on the daily time frame you can see that ethereum still has a long way to go to go back to the all-time highs the all-time high was around 4.8 K and fun fact when ethereum was

ethereum right now you might have thought i was going to talk about the charts and we're about to but that actually has absolutely nothing to do with it the fact that ethereum is not even back to all-time high when bitcoin is sitting at almost twice this all-time high figure is a great reason to buy ethereum and that's definitely important but more importantly than that think about what you're buying you're not buying ethereum coins you're buying ethereum's blockchain you're buying the value representative of that blockchain the ethereum coin represents the value that ethereum is providing to developers around the world that's why it's valuable and that my friends is why ethereum is number two and not number 50 or something it is valuable because it's being built upon it is infrastructure in the same way that google amazon apple verizon t-mobile all these different companies are infrastructure if there was a company that owned the interstate you bet your bottom dollar that it would be worth billions ethereum is infrastructure for decentralized application development in the same way that bitcoin is infrastructure for secure payments so with that said i will show you the charts the last couple of days on ethereum have been very bearish in the same way that bitcoin has we saw a 31 drop in a day and a half from there ethereum bounced back up set a thousand

millions of dollars you can buy millions of dollars uh over over just a few minutes if you want to personally even just uh yesterday I put a million dollars into Bitcoin and I had no issues with that at all even though Bitcoin experiences volatility it's among the most stable options available to investors in the crypto Market which places it among the best crypto currencies that you can invest in right now in my opinion no note that although Bitcoin operates on a proof of work consensus model it's considered to be the best crypto to invest in because of its sizable market share and the fact that Bitcoin is the king of all crypto Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to ever be created it can never be replicated you can never copy Bitcoin everything else becomes just a cheap version of Bitcoin unless you're trying to solve another problem that Bitcoin is not trying to solve and that takes me to ethereum ethereum is not a competitor to bitcoin ethereum is considered to be the very first smart contract platform and it has the largest market cap among all such layer 1 networks as such it's considered one of the best later one crypto projects to date and personally I have a bunch of ethereum in my wallet one reason is the ethereum virtual machine or the evm a decentralized computer that developers interact with while creating smart contracts because of this compatibility many other cryptocurrencies are based on the code that ethereum uses which allows developers to implement their projects on numerous blockchains even though Bitcoin is the most used currency on this list ethereum has a strong ecosystem and is considered to be the most decentralized later one currency by many which makes ethereum one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in right now number three on this list is cardano cardano aims to be a competitor to ethereum with a focus on scalability as well as ease of use the platform's scalability is centered around two distinct layers of technology which include Technologies for transferring value and tracking Ledger balances personally I do hold a little bit of cardano and not long ago I was at the Satoshi Round Table the most elite crypto

And you can see what I've earned from appreciation as well. And they're very transparent too, about what you're paying in advisory fees. Now, if you're wondering why these overall returns seem kind of low, well that's because I just recently ramped up my contributions here. So because I added so much money over the last couple of months, I haven't had that much time where that money's actually been invested, earning dividends and potentially earning appreciation. Now here's one of the big differences between investing in Fundrise and investing in a REIT. And that is the level of transparency available to you. Because right here, I can see exactly what my portfolio is invested in and it's across 187 different projects. Now of those projects, we can see 67% are equity and 33% are debt. And you can also see the rating of each of these properties telling you what are the more conservative investments and what are the riskier ones. So for example, let's just click on a random one here."", ""A lot of these different sites out there for crowdfunded real estate have different structures, and a lot of them are not very transparent about the fees they are charging.

Right on the homepage of your portfolio you can see your returns to date, and down here it shows you what you've earned from dividends, what you've earned from asset appreciation, and exactly how much money you paid in advisory fees. So, they're very transparent about that fee structure. And obviously guys looking at my performance here, these returns are what I actually earned after I paid that 1% fee to Fundrise. So, anyways guys that's gonna wrap up this portfolio update here. Let me know down in the Comment section below if you want to see me do a quarterly update of this portfolio, or how often you guys want me to update you on the balance and the growth of this portfolio."", ""But the problem with a publicly traded REIT is that it's susceptible to panic selling because of the high liquidity. And it's also almost directly correlated with the stock market. You want your assets doing different things at different times. And if your real estate investment takes a dip at the same time as your stock market investment, that essentially defeats the purpose of diversification. And again, not to mention, as we spoke to earlier, those publicly traded REITs are often lower in returns than private real state investments. And there is a lot less transparency because you really have no idea what exactly it is that you are investing in. In a little bit here we're gonna open up my Fundrise account and you're gonna be amazed at the level of transparency Fundrise offers showing you exactly what your money is invested in. Now, lastly, before we get into that live demo here, I want to cover the Fundrise fees so you are familiar with them. First of all, they have an advisory fee and an asset management fee and combined that is 1% per year that's going to be automatically deducted from your account.""]"

'stocks']","[""but there's also a few significant downsides that come with the territory like number one Dividends are not guaranteed even though companies generally try to avoid cutting or reducing dividends it does happen and because Dividends are generally a reflection of the company's profits in the event of a downturn they may choose to turn the money printer off until conditions improve second dividend payments mean nothing when the company itself declines in value in this case earning a five percent dividend could actually lose you money when the stock price declines something like 30 percent and this is an example that happens all the time just take a look at 3M Who currently pays A 5.6 dividend but they've lost more than 55 percent in value throughout the last five years from an ongoing lawsuit this year of course there's a chance the stock price recovers while you sit back and collect all the extra cash flow but there's also a chance that doesn't happen and that needs to be considered the third even though there can be some tax advantages there could also be some tax disadvantages"", ""see I'm like buying a stock and only being taxed when you sell Dividends are taxed the moment you receive them and depending on your tax bracket that could be a price of 20 or more not to mention in a way Dividends are even taxed twice once the corporate level is profit and then once again when you receive them so they're not exactly the most tax efficient and fourth dividends could flat out be Irrelevant in this case two well-known economists argued that if an investor needs the money all they really need to do is sell the stock and that dividends don't actually create any more value for the company itself it would be kind of like saying instead of getting paid a two percent dividend the stock price would just go up by an extra two percent whereas in both scenarios your value stays the exact same although in the big picture I do think that there are some major advantages for anyone looking to replace their income with this strategy so as far as how to do this as well as my own portfolio here's what you need to know although before we go into that when it comes to investing it's important to have as much information at your disposal as possible even for myself I'll spend hours combing through the most obscure reports just to find a few new details to

dollars when you use the link in the description or go to public.com feel free to check out all of the details down below and now with that said let's get back to the video all right now in terms of my own dividend portion of my own portfolio I currently receive almost ten thousand dollars a month through five main sources the first and largest is from a broad U.S Market ETF schb with the dividend yield of 1.56 percent this encompasses 2500 of the largest publicly traded us companies with slightly more exposure to smaller stocks than the S&P500 although not by much since both are weighted by market cap which means that the largest companies still make up the bulk of this investment but when you have over 3.8 million dollars invested here that's a dividend yield of about five thousand dollars a month second in addition to that I also have an international Equity ETF schf with a dividend yield of 2.65 percent for those of aware this fund includes large and mid-cap stocks from developed countries outside of the United States including Nestle's Samsung shell and Toyota along with about a hundred others I personally use this as a way to get diversification outside of the United States and since I have almost a million dollars invested here that brings in an additional two thousand dollars a month third in addition to that I also have a variety of individual stocks that I hold on the side to satisfy my need to feel like I could somehow beat the market that brings my total to about ninety four hundred dollars in dividends every single month or about a hundred and twelve thousand dollars a year regardless of what happens to the stock market but as far as how much you need to live entirely off the dividends here's the entire calculation to begin it all comes down to how much do you need after all the person living in a luxury high-rise Penthouse in New York City is going to live a much different lifestyle than someone who prefers to live off the grid in a tiny home in Montana so it would depend on what your expenses are but since the average retiree spends 50 thousand dollars a year we'll go with that as our Baseline the second when it comes to dividends you don't necessarily want to go for the stock that just pays the highest yield after all you want consistency and that's what brings us to the Holy Grail of passive income dividend Aristocrats"", ""and they essentially live off of the earnings of their money now the most simple example of this is dividends when you invest money in a dividend paying stock you end up earning those dividends typically every single quarter and this is a 100% passive method of investing and earning income so essentially the simplest way that you could never run out of money is by investing in a diversified collection of stocks that pay you dividends and then living off of those dividends and never touching a penny of principle and this right here is a concept that these true old-school rich people really understand if they can live off of the children of their money they're never going to run out of that initial pool of money so you're not gonna see a rich person putting millions of dollars into coca-cola or one specific stock they're typically going to be investing in a pool of different stocks also known as an ETF so one example of this is actually the Vanguard high dividend yield ETF it invests in companies like JP Morgan Chase ExxonMobil Johnson & Johnson AT&T and this ETF pays a three point one seven percent dividend yield so what that means is that for every $100 invested in this high dividend yield ETF you're going to earn 3 dollars and 17 cents per year in dividends so let's say for example you wanted to replace your $100,000 per year salary with 100% passive dividend income you would need to have about 3.2 million dollars in this ETF to give you about a hundred thousand dollars of dividends per year at that three point one seven percent yield so if you wanted to live off of your money never touch a penny of principal and have a six-figure income coming in from your dividends you're gonna need about 3.2 million dollars but the beauty of this is that you have 100% preservation of principal here you're living off of the dividends you're not touching a penny of principal and you could foreseeably live for the rest of your life off of that three million dollars but in general that is what these people are doing that is how rich people never run money now are they actually out there doing this themselves picking dividend stocks and investing in ETFs they are probably doing this""]"

10K account which is what that would be one hundred dollars and let's say for this specific trade our stop loss is 25 Pips so our risk tolerance is one hundred dollars and our stop loss is 25 Pips now see if you can do the math really quickly it should not take long at all using this equation to figure out what our losses per pip can be in order for us to be risking a hundred dollars on a trade would we have a 25 pip stop loss we can actually do this on a calculator really quickly to make it super easy we have a 100 risk that's our risk tolerance divided by the amount of Pips in our stop loss which is what 25 that gives us four that means four dollars is our lpp so lpp meaning the amount of money we can lose per pip is four dollars now with this being the case I want you to look over at our table and tell me what position size you should be using remember we can multiply these position sizes all of these by any number so with that being the case what you would do for a position size just by using the simple formula and having this table beside you you can figure this out in seconds the only thing you need to do is look over here lpp and figure out where can I get four dollars out of this"", ""and you want to risk 10 on this trade well if that's the case do you think you can actually do it now with a 50 pip stop instead of a five pip stop let's take a look with a 50 pip stop loss if we want to risk 10 then how much does each pip need to be worth that would mean that each pip would need to be worth 20 cents so if each pip needs to be worth 20 cents we already discussed this one micro lot is equal to 10 cents per pip and how much is a micro lot 1 000 units of currency so at this point we would need 2 000 units in order to place this trade so now just because we increased the size of the stop loss we can actually place this trade and still have 8 000 units left over because we're just taking that 2 000 units off of our 10 000 units of buying power so this is another way to avoid the insufficient margin situation is by doing nothing more than increasing the time frame you're trading on increasing the size of your stop loss because the bigger the stop loss the less amount of units you're going to need in order to equal that 10 risk or whatever your risk is you can by the way before i end the video you can exchange these numbers for any number at all and the equations are still exactly the same again if there was something here you didn't understand rewind the video and check it out i just wanted to get this out to you guys really quickly didn't happen to be that quickly looks like i'm above 15 minutes at this point"", ""and if not here's a little lesson for you a mini lot or 10 000 units of currency is normally equal to one dollar per pip is what that is normally worth so with this being the case if we are trying to have a five pip stop loss equal ten dollars of risk how many units of this currency will we have to buy for this situation to play out we will need all we have to do is multiply this by two right we need this to be two dollars per pip because in order to have a ten dollar risk on five pips of stop loss we need two dollars per pip to equal that ten dollar risk right so if 10 000 units is one dollar per pip then 20 000 units is what we need to purchase in order to make this trade happen and the reason we get the message that says insufficient margin is because you cannot hold 20 000 units of any currency or any pair while you only have 10 000 units of buying power does that make sense so this is the first reason your broker will say no to you every time you try to make this trade the reason they say no is because you are attempting to use 20 000 units on an account where you can only have 10 000 units of buying power and what is the cause of all this your stop-loss being too small the reason you're you're having this situation is because you have too small of a stop-loss and you're trying to risk too much money with that small stop-loss so let's talk about way number two that's the first way that you're going to get that message of insufficient funds insufficient margin whatever your brokerage calls it is because you're trying to hold whether your risk remember our risk right now we're still we're trying to risk only ten dollars so in most beginners heads it makes sense that i should be able to risk ten dollars on a hundred dollar account but the other two steps are to find out how many units i have to hold in order for this ten dollar risk to exist and in this case that would be twenty thousand units which your brokerage will not allow if you can only have uh 10 000 units of buying power so hopefully that made sense if it didn't watch that a couple of times i'm gonna try to make this into like a pretty short video the concepts are just pretty simple math""]"

inflation is a long-term one the decade of inflation that happened in the 70s could very well happen this time around if we don't play our cards right if we do not fix the issue and the imbalance between supply and demand and the monetary stimulus that is kept that demand so high we have doubled the base monetary Supply and that is going to have ramifications when it comes to oil natural gas property prices everything that plays a role in our cost of living now one other important thing to note is that as of last week although we don't have the data just yet as there's a bit of a lag on the data for the U.S strategic petroleum Reserve back on February 17th this is where we last have the data we can see that on the 14th the United States has announced that they're going to continue depleting that petroleum Reserve now I think this is definitely an important step in the short term to get us below that 200 week and to confirm the trend to the downside but again this can only affect oil's price for so long and eventually in order to have that negotiating weight there are periods of time where we're going to likely have to add to the Strategic petroleum Reserve to have that additional weight when we need it most to weigh down prices so again we're going to have to see how this plays out here but either way we only have so much firing power and I think this is a clear sign since back in January that the U.S is trying to test whether or not it needs to deploy that firing power I think if it was going to play it effectively it would have used a bit more in the short term and crush the trend so that the 200 we could start serving as resistance trust me guys things like this do matter when it comes to the overall trend here because you do have investors you do have long-term stakeholders who are preparing and staff backing up energy players like Europe that are trying to counteract this geopolitical tension between Russia which is previously one of its largest providers and producers of oil and natural gas so there is a key Dynamic we need to keep in mind here that but going back here to the topic around crypto right if we don't have inflation done I wanted to go ahead and spend some time to talk about crypto Quant there are data science partner here on the data Dash Channel and on top of that they've got a really great board that you guys can access to

signs of real capitulation any Bitcoin bear market now again I really want to bring this topic back into the conversation we have not seen even the typical corrective or capitulative signs of a traditional Bitcoin bear Market but Bitcoin has never lived through a proper 30 50 recession in equities"", ""well I'm not going to sit here and act like I can predict that and the short term nobody knows and in the short term there is really no floor or ceiling for what commodity prices can do and oil is absolutely no exception but in the long term there are a few things that I think are worth sharing now there's some really good research I kind of stumbled across from a guy called Gary Turner who is the CEO of Trove research and he published a really interesting study on basically Returns on equity and Returns on invested capital and Renewables and and oil companies and how that changes at different oil prices now the US is the largest producer of oil in the world and the Returns on equity and Returns on invested Capital that the companies and then you know of course the returns that investors can generate are going to be heavily dependent on the price of oil as Warren Buffett has just told us and uh This research from uh Gary Turner suggests that if oil were to stabilize in the 40 to 60 dollar Barrel range then the typical large U.S oil company would only earn about a four percent return on Capital and within that 40 to 60 dollar range those Returns on investor Capital actually changed quite dramatically uh at sixty dollar oil the average large U.S oil and gas company would earn about an eight percent return on invested capital and at forty dollar oil they would earn about a 1.3 return on invested Capital so all of that is to say that if oil were to get below say forty to sixty dollars a barrel in the very long term the US basically doesn't have a sustainable oil industry the returns will be too anemic to Warrant you know new Investments so that sort of puts potentially a longer term flaw on oil prices and you would think that over time the cost of production for oil will tend to go up we have that just through General inflation and asset prices and labor prices going up but we also have that through sort of the physical reality ways of finding oil you know all the easy oil has largely been sucked out of the ground already and oil companies are having to get sort of increasingly heroic and go further distances and so on to find new oil now in terms of a potential sealing price or upper limit for where Oil could go to there's a pretty famous saying in commodity businesses that the cure to high prices is high prices and that basically means that as commodity prices go up and companies start earning very high sort of super normal Returns on Capital that tends to encourage more people to produce that particular commodity and earn those super high Returns on Capital and that of course pushes prices back down again if it gets too extreme you have sort of the marginal producers of a particular commodity kind of pull back and restrain production and that's how you have these Epson flows and commodity prices over time but there are a few things that are potentially different this time and I know that is the most dangerous phrase and invest in but you have this very kind of political situation where producing more oil is very very frowned upon and you also have an investor base that is really demanding a capital return through dividends or BuyBacks having been burnt in a recent cycle add to that the fact again that oil will without doubt get harder to find over time I really don't know what the cln 2 oil prices could be now to sum up Buffett's investment case at an Occidental and Chevron I actually think it's very simple there's a lot of moving Parts here but I think there are really two core drivers behind this investment from Buffett firstly I think he probably has a view that long-term oil prices will be higher and they'll be higher for longer than most investors probably anticipate in many ways there is the structural mismatch between oil supply and oil demand and if those two things that I just said turn out to be correct they can really only mean one thing for oil prices which is that they have to go up the second thing that I think Buffett likes is that there is very little capital expenditure for growth he's getting a lot of his cash back very quickly through dividends and BuyBacks particularly when oil prices are as high as they have been recently oils come back a little bit in the past month but you know if we look at just the sheer amount of cash flow that companies like Occidental have been producing it's been pretty insane I mean oxy produced 4.2 billion dollars of free cash flow in their second quarter this year which is a six percent free cash flow yield just from that one quarters cash flow they also retired 4.8 billion in debt and purchase back 1.1 billion of stock"", ""so you're asking oil companies to further lower what makes you think that they are going to listen to an Administration that is ultimately trying to put them out of business how how is the administration trying to put them out of business well they produce fossil fuels and this President says he wants to end fossil fuel so look there's a couple of other things at play in terms of the investors and these oil companies firstly we've come out of a couple of really interesting phases of the oil cycle in 2007 and eight the last time that oil companies really rocketed up and oil prices were very high there was a lot of incentive for oil companies to grow and to deploy capital and finding more oil and that really caused quite a significant oversupply in the oil Market it meant that oil prices went down and really there were a lot of investors burned from encouraging companies to go through that exercise so there's been a real shift and if you listen to the likes of the Occidental quarterly conference calls you'll no longer hear them talking a lot about finding new oil and spending a lot of money on Capital expenditures to drill more Wells and so on uh you'll instead hear them talking a lot about debt repayment about sheer BuyBacks and about paying dividends to shareholders and finally there's some research that I covered in a previous video here on the channel that suggests that over the very long term if oil were to get below the say 40 to 60 dollar per barrel range it would really no longer be economic for most oil companies to exist so anything can happen in the short term with all sorts of commodity prices but that probably is some sort of very long-term floor for oil so to sum up where I think Buffett's head is probably out if I really had to guess I think there's probably two core factors really at play when he's investing in the likes of Occidental and Chevron I think firstly he probably has a view that oil prices stay higher for longer than most people anticipate and secondly I think he really likes the capital allocation taking place at these companies limited capital expenditure for growth and exploration and a lot of cash being funneled back towards shareholders through debt repayments dividends and share BuyBacks and to an extent I think that second capital allocation points probably reinforces the first point of oil prices Staying High if every company is just doing a bunch of sheer BuyBacks and paying dividends and no one's spending money on looking for new oil that is another kind of big constraint over the long term on oil supply now I recently actually got the chance to sit down and interview Jake Taylor who some of you may know from the value after hours podcast he's also the CEO of Farnam Street Investments and the author of The Rebel allocator the full podcast episode with Jake will be going live probably later this week on the investing with Tom podcast YouTube channel on and on all audio platforms as well and I just want to play a clip of something that Jake said in that podcast episode really exactly on some of the points I've been discussing in this video like I'm very hopeful that Humanity will make the transition from hydrocarbons to more renewable sources of energy and I think we will get there eventually I just think it's going to take a long time and as an investor if everyone thinks it's going to take a short time and you think it's going to take longer that that has often been a pretty good bet to make is that things take longer than than everyone thinks now we all know that Warren Buffett is a value investor anytime he's looking to buy into a particular company and oil is no exception he's looking to buy that business below its intrinsic value and he actually mentioned specifically in the 2007 annual shareholder meeting for Birch Hathaway uh how he thinks about investing in oil companies he said if we are in an oil stock it's because we think it offers a lot of value at this price but it does not mean we think the price of oil is going up if we thought oil was going up we could buy oil Futures which we actually did once so how exactly does Warren Buffett calculate something like intrinsic value for an oil company because these businesses are very different from a apple or Microsoft or Costco which a very steady businesses that produce stable and growing amounts of cash flow and earnings oil companies are quite different they can be very very volatile and the earnings year to year are heavily influenced by the price of oil again I want to play another clip here from my interview with Jake Taylor where he presents a pretty nice idea of thinking about valuation with some of these very cyclical businesses I think I ideally in a in like that type of commodity company you would you probably like Buy on Price to Book and sell on PE so wait until you buy when the business isn't working assuming that you know that it's it's a cyclical Decline and not a secular Decline

latest things that are tentatively within this a tonative deal and what it means for us I first of all let's start with this a course member asked me on Thursday if they should be buying shorts on this Market I said the big risk you're running buying shorts going into this three-day weekend is that you've got three days with no ability to close out your shorts or a debt deal could get done and it looks like that's what's happening now no guarantees that the Market's going to Skyrocket on this all it takes is j-pow or you know someone from the FED coming out saying you know what we are going to raise rates again in June which so far the market is actually pricing in that we are going to get another rate hike even though drone piles basically committed to the idea of a pause although then there's this idea of maybe we pause in June and re-hike again in July which is weird because that brings us back to the mid 70s which led to the Paul Volker era not what you want to hear but forget the FED for a moment let's think about the deals here or the details of this deal so basically we had a 90-minute phone call between Biden and McCarthy the two teams uh to negotiate the final details of the framework that they had roughly agreed to earlier this week now uh Janet Yellen this morning came out and said and gave a revised X date that's the date where the treasury Department expects to run out of money at first she gave a date of June 1st however this led a lot of Republicans to say nah that's a BS deadline most of the Wall Street expectations are June 8th through 9th which honestly I mean there's probably some buffer room she's giving because she you know if we hit that date wants to be able to have a few extra days just in case a deal is done then you got to get the procedurals done like the actual bill voted on which we got to talk about that because there could be some things that come up and actually slow that process down too the hardlining could still happen so buckle up for that but Jenny Ellen this morning came out and announced that June 5th would be the day that the treasury Department has about 130 billion dollars of payments that need to be made and that's going to be pretty tight so maybe June 5th is actually the X date uh either way here's the framework of roughly what was agreed to between McCarthy and Joe Biden after Janet Yellen came out with his date a lot of folks say that was sort of the leftover motivation Republicans needed to get over the edge though realistically I'm not sure how much of this date mattered uh whether it was the first or the fifth we just got to get it done"", ""Biden and McCarthy they reached a handshake deal on the debt ceiling both parties are claiming success while many in both parties are saying they got nothing out of it carthy came out to tell the American people that this was transformational while Jeffries said it was an incredibly significant step towards protecting Social Security here's the bottom line the government's in gridlock Republicans control the house Democrats control the Senate so they have to compromise Wall Street thinks this is a good thing because they do not want any one party to Rule the Day president has to sell it to the Democrats and McCarthy has to sell to the Republicans to get a place of agreement there's a ton of reasons why members in both parties would not sign and would not agree because largely in my view after looking at the agreement there was really very minor concessions made on all sides no somebody was getting a lot out of the deal it kind of was business as usual in Washington but here's the timeline that we're gonna watch it gets kicked off on Wednesday the house is going to vote and then it's gonna go if it passes there to the Senate and those guys will have four days to get it passed if they sign it in that four day period it's then going to get rushed over to the president who's going to sign it into law if everything went perfectly that would give us the date of June 5th which would be next Monday for a resolution to the debt ceiling crisis we already know though that Janet Yellen has been out sounding the alarms that the U.S government will absolutely run out of cash early June and if we were to default she has said many times that it would cause severe damage to financial institutions as well as the general economy and on that note a recent analytics report said that a brief debt ceiling breach would slash 1.5 million jobs wow raising unemployment from 3 point four percent to five percent my first thought on that is well that would make the FED happy his goal is to get unemployment up to begin to put pressure on inflation and that would immediately solve that concern so you really never know what the powers that be may do in this situation and we also got a report from Goldman Sachs they predicted that the treasury will run low on cash by June 8th or 9th unless the debt ceiling limit was raised this basically means that the government is just barely screeching across the finish line to get this whole thing resolved now I have to play this clip by Warren Buffett on balancing the U.S budget because in my view it is timeless classic war and wisdom and it's spot on so check this out these problems aren't been mature enough for a president that's been mature enough to take this head off"", ""they can make more money number two they can spend less money or number three they can increase the cred credit card limit and continue taking loans out from the credit card because they now have a higher line of credit that's what the US government is doing every single year when this becomes an issue instead of raising expenditure by raising taxes or cutting the deficit by cutting expenditure the government just kicks the can down the road by raising the debt ceiling this debt ceiling then therefore becomes a political football between fiscal conservatives who want to cut expenditure and liberals that want to increase expenditure while also increasing taxes and that's the exact position that we're in right now there has become a showdown between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican house Speaker Kevin McCarthy house Speaker Kevin McCarthy leads a theoretically Coalition of fiscal conservatives that want to get the budget under control Joe Biden leads the Democrats who are much more inclined to spend more money and just raise the deficit even farther Kevin McCarthy and Joe Biden have been going back and forth for weeks trying to reach some kind of agreement that would raise the debt limit stopping the United States government from entering into a default just a couple of days ago speaker McCarthy tweeted this I just got off the phone with president obedico after he wasted time and refused to negotiate for months we've come to an agreement in principle that is worthy of the American people it seems that there's a last minute agreement coming through and there more than likely will be nobody on Capitol Hill wants to be the person that caused the entire global economy to collapse but the uncertainty of whether or not that will occur is hanging over the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and stock market like a dark cloud and for good reason treasury secretary Janet Yellen says a U.S default would trigger a global economic downturn and Moody's predicts that a default would lead to 6 million jobs lost 12 trillion dollars in household wealth evaporating and four percent of gross domestic products disappearing on top of that that would lead to a complete demise of United States treasuries which are widely considered to be the safest investment you can possibly make a default on U.S debt would be the destruction of the United States economy and would send shock waves through geopolitics for the rest of the century basically it'd be the movie 2012 meets the big short but the debt ceiling is likely to have an agreement rate Sean in the next couple of days and then after that comes through we'll likely see a rally on the stock market which will then lead to a rally on bitcoin however it's not all Sunshine rainbows after that happens because we're still having to deal with CPI you see the Consumer Price Index is a metric that tracks inflation in the United States economy and everything thing from shelter to gasoline to natural gas or electricity to eggs and then CPI is broken up into two categories number one all items and number two all items minus food and energy while all items has been coming down nicely to 4.9 percent all items less food and energy currently sits at 5.5 percent and its drop is completely stagnative over the course of the last five months CPI dropping is a very good thing but the problem is all items and core inflation that being all items minus food and energy have both started to stagnate right around five percent and this season of inflation coming down very aggressively is likely to be over starting this month when the next data comes out on June 13th in fact many economists are predicting that inflation is going to get a lot stickier under the five percent Mark for all items and for core inflation and that's very important because that impacts Jerome Powell's fed's decision on effective federal funds right hikes you see the effect of federal funds rate is described by the New York fed like this the effective federal funds rate is calculated as a volume weighted median of overnight federal funds transactions in English the effective federal funds rate is more or less the base rate that all other interest rates in the United States economy are based off of that includes car loans Home Loans personal loans commercial loans and pretty much any other kind of loan including credit card loans whenever the infected federal funds rate increases then that causes every single other interest rate to increase which increase the cost of taking on debt which reduces the amount of liquidity in the United States market and makes it harder to expand because we live in a credit and debt based society the FED has been hiking rates at their fastest rate in over 40 years in a Hail Mary attempt to try and get inflation under control the problem is that inflation is not going down anymore because of the hiking interest rates it's staying sticky at five percent because of various geopolitical realities that the FED has no power over whereas many of us were hoping for a Fed rate pause come June 14th when the meeting happens now many people including myself are predicting that we're going to see another 25 basis point rate hike from 5.15 percent all the way up to 5.4 another rate hike when we were hoping for a pause would almost certainly lead to a major drop in Bitcoin especially considering the right decision will come out the day after CPI comes out which is likely to be lackluster in conclusion Bitcoin has been looking forward to a very bullish June as a result of a recent Lux algo Buy Signal and a bullish cross on on macd followed by a bullish cross above the 50 level on RSI however as a result of the uncertainty around the debt ceiling we've seen timidity coming from the United States stock market as it attempts to break above critical resistance at 420 that timidity is spilled over into Bitcoin and means that it's having a hard time going into a rally as well that timidity on U.S stocks is going to continue until we reach a decision on the debt ceiling hike because many people are predicting if a decision does not get made and the United States defaults on its debt the stock market could drop by over 45 percent 20 trillion dollars and while there is most likely going to be a decision reached which will lead to that timidity Vanishing in the United States stock market just a week after that decision is probably going to be raged on June 5th or 6th then we're probably going to see bearish data coming from CPI in the very next day on June 14th we're going to see a Fed rate hike when we were hoping for a pause all of that to mean that the first two weeks of June are shaping up to actually be very difficult for Bitcoin and if we see any bullishness from Bitcoin we should take that as a great sign of the health of the market because it's got so many things standing in its way right now but the thing I want you guys to remember is that these dark clouds are temporary I just decision on the debt ceiling will be made in the next week and the decision that seems to be taking place will kick the can down the road for another two years and we won't have to worry about until January of 2025.""]"
85,84,35,84_whale_cryptocurrencies_cryptocurrency_movements,"['whale', 'cryptocurrencies', 'cryptocurrency', 'movements', 'altcoins', 'crypto', 'onchain', 'coin', 'coins', 'supply']","[""well the answer changes depending on which whale tracking tool you're using for example whale alert seems to report every transaction on 13 blockchains that exceeds 1 million us dollars in its twitter feed this arbitrary threshold can be a huge problem when it comes to measuring how much of an impact a well movement could have on the price of a cryptocurrency this is because of market depth market depth tells you how much money is required to push the price of a cryptocurrency up or down on any given cryptocurrency exchange this can easily be checked on coingecko or coin market cap under the markets tab the more money it takes to push up or push down the price by two percent the greater the market debt that crypto has here's why that's relevant if you see 10 million dollars worth of bitcoin being transferred from a wallet to an exchange with a market depth of 20 or 30 million dollars to the downside even if all that bitcoin is sold immediately it will have a negligible effect on price however most altcoins have market depths in the millions and sometimes less this means a whale movement of that size would decimate the price of that altcoin as it would bleed the order books dry what's more is that sometimes an altcoins whale movement is so small in dollar terms that it's not even picked up by whale tracking tools even then it could still be enough to crash the price as such it's important to take note of the market depth for a cryptocurrency when you're trying to determine what effect a whale movement will actually have on its price and not immediately assume that the sky is falling or that we're going to the moon whenever whale alert makes a tweet this brings me to the second factor that's often forgotten about whale movements and that's that not all whale movements are created equal because most altcoins are heavily correlated to bitcoin a bitcoin whale movement could crush your favorite alt even though there was no significant whale activity taking place on that altcoins blockchain moreover as we approach the peak of this bull market certain whale transactions will become more important than others here's what i mean by that on any given day we see a few dozen whale movements for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum some of these are large a few of them are massive and they have a predictable effect on price what you don't see every day is an old bitcoin wallet making a transaction for the first time in a very long while transactions from these dormant bitcoin wallets can seriously shake up the market and that's because they suggest that prices have risen high enough that even the most hardcore huddlers want to sell usually these ancient whale movements make the crypto news and are sometimes noted by whale trackers as well luckily most of these have been small wallet to wallet transactions in recent months however if we start to approach that 100k or 200k mark and you start to see some of these old wallets start to move a bunch of their bitcoin onto exchanges it might mean we are at or near the top in terms of price for this cycle it's also important to remember that the significance of a whale transaction depends on the tokenomics of the cryptocurrency and which whale wallet the transaction is coming from there's a difference between the largest dogecoin holder dumping 10 million doge and a smaller dogecoin wallet doing the same if large whale transactions from a wallet to an exchange are consistently coming from the largest holder of a cryptocurrency that's inequitably distributed it might be time to abandon ship the same rule applies to transactions made from cryptocurrency wallets belonging to famous crypto billionaires like vitalik buterin vitalik is known for selling a substantial chunk of his ethereum near the peak of the previous bull market now unlike most crypto billionaires vitalik has made his wallet address public"", ""take note of whether the cryptos on your lists meet these minimum thresholds if you notice one of the cryptocurrencies you're considering has a remarkably low following compared to its ranking then there is a chance that a lot of the price action you're seeing is manipulation after all if there is hardly any community engagement then who the hell is doing all the trading shady price action is usually quite easy to spot on coin market cap and coin gecko dead giveaways are low trading volumes with sudden spikes and limited exchange support for reference most cryptocurrencies in the top 100 have 24-hour trading volumes in the billions or at least the hundreds of millions those in the top 200 have 24-hour trading volumes in the hundreds of millions or at least the tens of millions now again take note if you see any abnormalities here for the cryptos you're considering once you've established that the cryptos you're examining have a decent amount of social engagement that isn't just hype the next step in your triage is to check supply sources and demand drivers broadly speaking there are two supply sources in cryptocurrency inflation and vesting i.e the unlock periods for any coins or tokens allocated to private investors or the team behind the crypto project if we're being technically accurate almost every single cryptocurrency on the market has some amount of real inflation even if it has a maximum supply since new coins or tokens are being created every day most cryptocurrencies have levels of inflation that range from five to ten percent others such as tokens you earn from yield farming and d5 can have annual inflation rates in the hundreds of percent inflation isn't really a problem if you're only planning on holding a cryptocurrency for a few weeks or months you can also sometimes offset that inflation while you wait to sell by staking that coin or token however inflation can have some serious implications when you couple it with a vesting schedule and this is something that is often overlooked by even the most experienced crypto investors as i discussed in my video on tokenomics most cryptocurrencies we see today were pre-mined meaning the founders created some or all of the supply of that cryptocurrency in advance usually only a very small percentage of that initial supply is sold to retail investors like you and me with the rest going to venture capitalists private investors and the team behind the project this is why most cryptocurrencies have a low circulating supply and you can usually check how that cryptocurrency was initially allocated using ico drops or massari the coins or tokens allocated to private parties usually have a lengthy unlock period to prevent everyone from selling too soon after the coin or token starts trading because it would crash the price while vesting schedules come in all shapes and sizes the main thing to look out for is any large vesting cliffs because this sudden release of tokens in such a short period of time often suppresses price action using polygons matic token as an example we can see that its price seems to have stagnated in the first week or two after each vesting cliff as private investors sell some of their unlocked tokens the worst part is that many cryptocurrency projects allow their initial investors to stake their coins or tokens while they are vesting in other words they are earning inflationary rewards while they wait in some cases these coins or tokens have been vesting for years and sometimes the inflationary rewards from staking began accumulating well before that crypto even began trading on the market this can turn an initial allocation of 10 million tokens into an actual allocation of 12 or 15 or even 20 million tokens by the time they're unlocked when that vesting cliff comes a crash could come with it if you see a coin or token on your wish list that has a high inflation schedule coupled with an aggressive vesting schedule wherein staking was possible you might want to count it out that is unless it has strong demand drivers while there are multiple demand drivers in cryptocurrency two of the most powerful are use case and institutional demand in terms of use case btc's primary use case is as a store of value whereas eth's primary use case is to pay for gas fees on the ethereum network the robustness of the bitcoin network and the size of ethereum's ecosystem is why there is a constant demand for both even if the cryptocurrencies you're considering have high inflation and aggressive vesting schedules it is very possible that the demand for some of them could be high enough to overcome that supply shock polygons matic token is again a good example of this even with vesting matic has been flying lately and that's because people want to use ethereum dapps with cheaper fees on its layer 2 blockchain now if you're lucky some of the cryptocurrencies you're considering might be on the radar of institutional investors like retail investors institutional investors are starting to get more comfortable with altcoins and have been getting exposure through various exchange-traded products like greyscale's crypto trusts grayscale has been buying up billions of dollars of cryptocurrency on behalf of its clients and it's currently in the process of getting confirmation for almost a dozen more trusts i'll leave links to a few of those trust filings in the video description so that you can check if one of your crypto picks is on the list pro tip be aware that many crypto projects will shill their institutional connections and partnerships even though they have no practical effect on their coin or token do extra research for these claims when examining the cryptocurrencies on your list ask yourself if there are any use cases beyond speculative retail investing that could push up the price of those coins or tokens ideally the demand coming from the use case should be real something long-term and not due to a short-term incentive of some kind once you've identified those use cases you have to honestly ask yourself whether there are other crypto projects competing in that niche that are doing a better job or could do a better job in my experience some of the best cryptocurrencies are those that have a practical use case in a small niche without much competition travala's ava token comes to mind here anyways the problem with most cryptocurrencies that have a strong use case or institutional investment is that they have seen most of their growth for this bull market so this brings me to the final factor you need to keep in mind assuming the cryptos left on your list have high social engagement with minimal hype and demand drivers that outweigh its supply sources the last thing to check for is growth potential now let's start with a reality check the bull market technically began in may last year and we have anywhere between four to eight months left before this one is over unfortunately most cryptocurrencies have gone up by 10x or more already on the bright side though even large cryptocurrencies like btc and eth will likely double and possibly triple in price by the end of the year as i mentioned earlier though a 2 or 3x on a small investment isn't a life-changing amount and you'll lose a lot of that money in exchange fees and transaction fees if you go with btc and eth luckily for you there are still dozens of cryptocurrencies that could 10x or more and a few of them might be on your list start by organizing the remaining cryptos on your list by market cap from largest to smallest as a general rule of thumb the smaller the market cap the more potential it will have to grow the trade-off here is risk smaller capitals will be very volatile and there's no guarantee that they'll pump next open up the coin market cap or coin gecko pages for each of those cryptos again and check to see what exchanges they're trading on if they're trading on good exchanges but not binance or coinbase then there's a possibility one of them could be listed there if they continue to see community growth and development now while i'm not sure about binance's listing criteria i recently made a video about coinbase's listing criteria which is linked to in the top right"", ""[Music] before we go for a swim there's a disclaimer i need to pin if you're here hoping to get some

to skip to any topics that you can't wait to know just remember watching the whole way through will help this video find its way to others like you so without further ado let's take a look at what whale movements can do to understand whale movements you need to be familiar with on-chain analysis so here's a quick crash course as you know most cryptocurrency blockchains are publicly viewable that means that anyone can see most crypto transactions happening in real time and this can easily be done using a blockchain explorer what's cool is that this level of transparency lets you do much more than just verify whether your transaction went through or not most blockchain explorers make it possible to rank wallet addresses based on how much of that crypto coin or token they hold some like etherscan.io do this by default now this is extremely useful because it can show you whether the supply of that coin or token is evenly distributed among its holders or whether there are just a few wallets holding most of the supply if the supply of a coin or token is heavily concentrated among a few wallets there's a big risk that one of those wallet holders could start to sell and this would crash the price of that coin or token blockchain explorers can even help you figure what people are doing with their cryptocurrency most blockchain explorers will label wallets belonging to centralized and decentralized exchanges this can give you a sense of whether people are trading or holding those coins or tokens if a significant amount of a cryptocurrency supply is sitting on exchanges it's likely that the people who hold that cryptocurrency aren't looking to do so for the long term if you can see that most of a cryptocurrency supply is being held often exchange this suggests that the people who hold that crypto don't plan on selling it anytime soon now some clever crypto traders have even gone as far as tracking down crypto wallets belonging to rich individuals and institutions this makes it possible to mimic the buying and selling behavior of smart money and sometimes makes it possible to spot and buy a hot 100x altcoin before it even makes the news these more elaborate on-chain tactics are much harder to do manually and that's why companies like glassnode and crypto quant exist on-chain analytics platforms combine price with on-chain data to create new indicators that often give you a much clearer view of the crypto market than technical analysis indicators and price patterns for example glassnode's hodl wave indicator shows you how much of bitcoin's supply has moved over a given time period when those darker hodl waves start to peak it means people are starting to sell as you can see the tip of those peaks corresponds quite nicely to previous bull market tops the only problem is that most of these advanced on-chain indicators cost thousands of dollars to use some of them even cost tens of thousands of dollars per year the good news is that many of the free on-chain metrics are just as good if you know how to use them correctly and this includes whale movements in a sentence a whale movement is a large cryptocurrency transaction insert your own joke about moby dick using the bathroom here it's a simple signal that can have a colossal effect on the price of a cryptocurrency depending on where that transaction is going when you see a cryptocurrency is being sent from a regular wallet to an exchange wallet on a blockchain explorer this means the person who sent that cryptocurrency probably wants to sell it this isn't a big deal when the transaction is small but if you see hundreds of millions of dollars of a cryptocurrency being sent from a wallet to an exchange that amount of cell pressure could crash the price conversely if you see that hundreds of millions of dollars of a cryptocurrency is being sent from an exchange and into a wallet whoever's behind that wallet is not planning on selling anytime soon if there are enough whale movements off exchanges and into wallets for a specific cryptocurrency this sudden reduction in market ready supply can be rocket fuel for positive price action the effects are reversed for these two whale movements when they involve stable coins if hundreds of millions of usdt or usdc are moving from a wallet to an exchange this means that whales are looking to buy and that could mean the market is about to pump if hundreds of millions of stable coins are moving off exchanges this means that whales don't plan on investing anytime soon and that could mean a temporary downturn or even a full-on bear market if you're wondering what those exchange to exchange whale movements are all about the answer is arbitrage in other words a whale is taking advantage of a small difference in price between two exchanges and because they have so much capital that small difference offers a sizeable return in dollar terms the last type of whale movement is wallet to wallet transactions and these are probably the most misunderstood of the bunch believe it or not most large investors don't use cryptocurrency exchanges this is because the large amount of crypto they're looking to buy or sell could stir up the market in the ways i just mentioned instead they do over-the-counter trading or otc otc allows big investors to buy or sell large amounts of cryptocurrency directly from an exchange or cryptocustodian at a fixed price when you're seeing hundreds of millions of dollars of cryptocurrency going between wallets it's probably an otc trade of some kind the thing is that you can never know for sure whether it was a purchase or a sale until after the fact now this is why tesla's purchase of bitcoin didn't affect the price of btc until they publicly announced it so what this means is that you don't have to pay too much attention to wallet to wallet whale movements since they typically have a negligible effect on price now in theory the transaction dynamics i just mentioned are all you need to know about whale movements and some of you might be familiar with everything i've said up to this point the thing is there are a few factors that can turn whale movements into a misleading signal and these are often overlooked by the average crypto trader the first factor relates to definition how large does a cryptocurrency transaction have to be for it to be classified as a whale movement""]"

So if you\'re confused, you\'re like, ""Clay, how are you making money ""when Boeing is falling and falling?"" \'Cause I went short on it and that\'s how that works. But like I said, you saw the revision right down there. Then I alerted it again. The dead cat, dead cat meaning a dead cat bounce. And all a dead cat bounce is something begins to bounce like Boeing did, right? You saw it bouncing, but you believe it to be just a failure, not a true bounce. And you\'re gonna looking for it to roll back over which is exactly what happened. And you saw me get in up above the 180, I got in at 184.70. So like I said, I was anticipating the break.', ""but sometimes I stock went down for whatever reason because the margins weren't what they were supposed to be or because guidance was a little weak the next quarter for whatever reason that stock would go down and then I would get burnt because then I would have margin calls coming after me and all those kinds of things so that's why I highly suggest you do not short-term trade on margin if possible you have to have a margin account pretty much too short-term trade because if your short-term trading you're in and out of stocks every day every week or whatever and it takes three business days for a stock position to close out so which means you pretty much have to make a margin account but the trick is you don't really want to go on margin and if you do go on March and don't go heavy like I used to because that is when real bad things should happen because then you're forced to sell a position before you may want to because the margin calls and those kinds of things or deposit more money plus if you lose money you're paying interest on that margin usually I used to pay like six and a half percent so say I had a 100k on margin six and a half percent over the course of a year that's six thousand five hundred dollars not fun if you're losing money and you're paying margin so when short term trading try to stay away from margin in my opinion even if you think you're so right because I felt I was so where I don't so many and sometimes it just didn't go the way I expect it you know this made my numbers were all right they blew them out but the stock would go down or vice versa so these four tips hopefully guys should help you immensely as a short-term trader and as a beginner to understand these tips are critical in my opinion they're critical because you're going to need them every step of the way I thank you so much for watching this today guys if you have not subscribed yet you may want to I talk about personal finance on the channel talk about entrepreneurship I'm an entrepreneur so I give a lot of tips and we talk so much about the stock market on the channel and do videos like we did today hit that thumbs up button if you enjoyed and have a great day""]"

in sketchy markets big name brands can act as a figurative Rock holding them down but what a big name brand enters the mix that also serves as a catalyst for potential moves example GoPro ran up 12% the day of announcing a partnership with apprentice capital which is a big name in the niche and likewise if you can identify opportunities with a large amount of institutional investors holding on you are less likely to be investing in Smoak and Meers big name brands such as Blackrock or Vanguard have teams and teams of analysts scavenging through each and every opportunity while I always say that analysts are monkeys when it comes to firms that are actually putting their money where their mouth is they're less likely to be monkeys but understanding institutional investment decisions also gives you a heads up when a big name brand finds an opportunity that we may have missed and as retail traders we just don't have the brainpower or the resources who find each and every opportunity as they present themselves for example in my personal research I found that tt NP which is essentially gutted both fundamentally and in terms of their share price I found that they are still receiving large increases quarter-over-quarter of investment from large institutions thus I've added that to my watchlist and I'm looking for other elevating factors that might predate a run up such as the other ones we've talked about ok next criteria so if you're looking for a penny stock that is about to spike doesn't it make sense for that penny stock to have a previous pattern of doing so that's something that I like to call spike ability if you can identify a stock with previous spike ability you can then identify what made it spike in the first place and then aim to target similar events in the future for example Etan was our previous pick and it spiked massively"", ""Peter Lynch famously said that insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons but they'd buy them for only one they think the price will rise and the data on the specs Peter Lynch up stocks that insiders buy do tend to perform better than average and although stocks that insiders sell do tend to perform worse than average the relationship is far stronger on the buy side studies from Cohen in 2010 and the University of Michigan in 2000 both concluded that insiders who buy their stock in the open market tend to outperform the market and it's especially the case in situations where The Insider Buys in an opportunistic fashion as opposed to more of a routine regular buying fashion in this video I want to share where I personally look for large Insider transactions I want to share an example of one recent Insider buy and a very well-known company that really ticks a lot of boxes in terms of what I would be looking for and a large and very interesting Insider purchase and I also want to share some tips for looking at both Insider purchases and sales to get a better understanding of why those transactions might have taken place if you enjoyed the video and haven't subscribed to the channel already please be sure to do so but with all that said let's get straight into this video on inside of buying and selling now firstly it's really important to remember that just buying stocks that insiders have been buying is not some guaranteed path to outperforming the stock market it's really just maybe a filter for finding new ideas and it's kind of an interesting place to start you know they always say to fish where the fish are look for stocks and markets that are generally cheap or in areas where those stocks tend to outperform and this is potentially another one of those interesting places to look you still need to do your work on understanding the business looking for a competitive Advantage partnering with talented Anonymous management and buying at a reasonable price but oftentimes when exactly in the company are putting a large percentage of their net worth into their own stock it's a pretty good sign and it's a very interesting place to hunt for ideas and the US directors and officers of the company are required to disclose any transactions that they have when they're buying or selling stock in the open market that's done through something called a form four form fours also need to be filed in cases where someone who owns more than 10 percent of all this year's outstanding makes a transaction and there's a number of websites out there that pull together the form for us from all sorts of different companies to allow investors to search and kind of hunt for interesting ideas the website I use personally is one called open Insider it allows me to filter on different sizes of purchases uh what position that person has in the company and I can also kind of type in individual stocks that I might be looking at just to see what's happening under the hood in terms of Insider transactions now a somewhat recent example which I thought might be interest to sheer and this purely is just for example purposes this is not me telling you to go ahead and buy the stock or sell the stock or anything like that it's just one that came on my radar that I had a lot of the things that I kind of look for when putting weight behind Insider purchases and that was actually a recent investment by an Insider and none other than Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire Hathaway of course is unique for many reasons but one of the reasons that it's Unique in this case is because uh any kind of insiders who end up owning a bunch of stock and Berkshire they're generally doing it through pulling money out of their own pockets and buying stock in the open market Berkshire is famous for kind of not having any sort of stock option programs that incentivize their managers uh their managers are certainly incentivized and can earn a lot of money by doing well on the individual business units but they're almost always compensated by cash payments as opposed to issuing them with purchase stock so it was very cool to see that Greg Abel very likely the future CEO of Berkshire probably the front runner to take over from Warren Buffett go out and buy a significant amount of stock in the open market back in October 2022.""]"

business was something grand emphasized continuously and Buffett credits Graham for helping him think of investing as a business owner rather than just a stock certificate holder in the intelligent investor Graham wrote quote investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike he went on to say a corporate security may be best viewed in the first instance as an ownership interest in or claim against a specific business enterprise end quote although they should most investors don't take that businesslike mindset when investing in the stock market coming in at number 7 and this is difficult for many investors is maintaining a disciplined and systematic investment approach Graham specifically promoted a quantitative approach to investing a quantitative method provided more protection in Graham's mind because I offered a disciplined unemotional way to buy a group of value stocks that over time would have the potential to outperform qualitative investing approaches according to Graham and evolve forecasts and predictions which he believed represented a speculative way to invest that would lead to poor results in chapters 14 and 15 of the intelligent investor grandma aligned to different investing strategies using specific and concrete fundamental and valuation criteria the first was the defensive investor method and this is a strategy we run on video it includes things like looking at the size of the company whether or not the company has a strong financial condition its earnings record and lastly multiple valuation metrics many investors aren't wired to follow a systematic investment strategy but in Graham's mind this was the best chance for long-term success in the market in the number-8 slot his investors should realize that stock prices are there for your convenience only Graham wrote that stock prices were there to be quote taken advantage of or to be ignored"", ""quote Graham understood the future was largely unknowable and then investing in the stock market came with uncertainty and risk he wrote quote the future itself can be approached in two different ways which may be called the way of prediction or projection and the way of protection and quo by staying away from predicting and focusing on protection Graham gravitated towards stocks of companies that were so cheap that even if the future was worse than expected there was limited downside in their price and this plays into our next point which is finding stocks with a margin of safety buying shares of companies that had a margin of safety was a central concept in Graham's investment approach the margin of safety was intended to provide downside protection in the event that the future profits of the company deteriorated because Graham believed the future was highly unpredictable and that earnings of companies were also highly variable he favored stocks of companies that could be bought at or below their net asset value to determine this he would take a firm's current assets and net out all liabilities this formula effectively gives you the price a buyer would pay in the event of a liquidation and assigns no value to long term assets for companies valued at or below this level it was implied that there could be upside as the business improved and also limited downside in the event that the business didn't improve number five on the list you got to be willing to put in the work if you've ever picked up the intelligent investor you know it's a daunting book over 500 pages in small eight type font security analysis Graham's first book was even longer at 725 pages the thoroughness in the books reflect Graham's thinking that to fully educate yourself on the markets and value investing it takes a lot of time a lot of work and a lot of effort Todd combs one of the portfolio managers handpicked by Warren Buffett to manage part of Berkshire Hathaway's public market portfolio one said that his daily work schedule is quote literally just reading about 12 hours a day and quote the bottom-line investing takes a lot of time energy and continuous learning and it's difficult for many of us to have the patience and interest in pursuing what it takes to become knowledgeable on the markets and how to become a true value investor investors need to think more like business owners and that's number six in Berkshire Hathaway's 2013 annual letter to shareholders Warren Buffett wrote about two small real estate investments he had made one an investment in a farm in Iowa and to a building New York Siti both proved to be good investments for Buffett but that really wasn't his main objective in sharing the information with us what he was trying to emphasize is the importance that when you're buying an asset such as a stock or a piece of property you're actually buying into the business and you're entitled to the future cash flows generated by those assets Buffett writes quote stocks provide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas yet to see a quotation for either my farm or my New York real estate investment end"", ""but as Warren Buffett once said value investing is simple but not easy the truth is the vast majority of investors will never be able to become value investors as defined by Ben Graham for the reasons we'll outline in a moment this isn't our critique but rather an exercise in illustrating the many components of a value investing approach and mentality while the list we're going to walk through is by no means exhaustive it captures the central tenets behind what Graham believed contributed to successful value investing number one on the list be an independent critical thinker Graham encouraged investors to think for themselves in mind an intelligent investor wasn't the smartest guy in the room but instead the one that used a fact-based methodology and was able to control his or her own emotions Wall Street Journal columnist Jason schwag who updated and provided commentary for the third edition of the intelligent investor neatly summarizes this he writes quote the components that are needed in the character of an intelligent investor are patient's independent thinking discipline eagerness to learn self-control and self-knowledge end quote by being an independent thinker there's a good chance you won't be influenced by the consensus and you will come to your own conclusion based on the facts the vast majority of investors rely on others to form their opinions the so called market experts are busy giving their daily market predictions Graham preached forming conclusions based on cold hard numbers and believed that following the advice of the forecasters was always a bad idea number two on the list maintain a contrary and mindset Seth Klarman founder the value oriented firm Bob Post group called value investing quote a marriage between a contrarian and a calculator end quote for Graham and most other D value investors the contrary anism comes through and buying value stocks which are often stocks that investors are negative on for one reason or another I mean look at the top stocks driving the market today Google Amazon Facebook

Now it's estimated that the meat market is going to grow by about one point five percent per year. So if we were to grow one point four trillion out until 2029 which is 10 years from our current year and 11 years from our 2018 one point four trillion Well we end up with about one point six five trillion dollars in meat spent for twenty twenty nine. So now we have to make a few more assumptions. First let's assume that only half of the entire meat industry can actually have a similar product created with plant based products. Now Beyond Meat is doing this for pork beef and poultry. So management is Beyond Meat claims that they can actually do 100 percent of products out there. But let's be conservative and assume only half of the meat market will have a viable replacement with plant based meats. That leaves us with the potential market for BYND of about eight hundred and twenty five billion dollars."", ""here's the thing is if the overall AI Market is expanding and growing massively right now then this company not growing its sales actually means that they are losing massive amounts of market share and they're not really executing it that well they may have a high performance corporate culture and a veteran disciplined management team but the company's profits are going completely the wrong direction the company is losing more money than ever and the management is really making more money than ever at the same time so let's head back over to stock unlock and we're going to take a look at this company's income statement and very clearly right here the green bars are the revenue that the company generates and then the bars beside that red bars are the expenses or the costs for the company we can see that the overall trend here and the trailing 12 months is that the company's Revenue isn't really growing but its expenses continue growing quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter and it continues losing more and more money if we also head over to the balance sheet here and take a look at the company's total cash we can see that it peaked here in the first quarter of 2021 at 1.1 billion and ever since then every single quarter it has been losing money this is because the company is in fact losing money and it's burning through its cash position to stay in business which is exactly what we saw with the cash flow statement as well now if we also go and take a look at the recent Insider transactions there has been absolutely no buys there is no buys on the list of drop downs here on stock unlock so let's take a look at the cells and when we scroll down we can see that insiders are consistently selling off their shares large blocks of shares are being sold and no insiders ever buy this stock and all of the selling is going on all of this selling this whole entire page of selling is just within the last year back to June of 2022 so over the past year insiders seemed like they were selling off massive amount of shares and this is why the stock was declining as well this is why the stock was down like 90 from its all-time highs this is not what I'd like to see personally in management teams I like to see management buy more shares while the stock is falling and basically in all of the businesses that I own especially in smaller cap companies like this I really focus on the management team how effective are they and are they continuing to buy the shares while it's going down and I also like to see them have large positions in the stocks that I own this is not the case with AI right here"", ""so how this company is staying in business is it is selling off its Investments to raise money and keep the lights on and we can see right here that the net cash provided by investing activities was 60 million dollars of this year and 317 Million last year so again that is how how the company is staying in business is slowly selling off its Investments and its Assets Now at the bottom of the cash flow statement here we can see that the net decrease in cash this year was 55 million dollars whereas last year it was 236 million so now if we go to the company's balance sheet we can see that the cash and cash equivalents this year have declined by about 50 million and the short-term Investments have declined by about 160 or 180 million ultimately this means that the total current assets have declined by about 200 million dollars year over year and slowly this company's cash is in fact running out now lastly I went over to the company's investor presentation for their most recent quarter and this is what they have to say and while we're reading this keep in mind that this company's revenue is not growing its expenses are growing the management is paying themselves a massive amount of stock based compensation and the company is losing more money than ever before right now now let's take a look at this slide from their their most recent quarter huge addressable Market of nearly 800 billion dollars by 2026 they have a first mover advantage they have patented Enterprise and AI application platform substantial Market partner ecosystem recognized AI Market leadership proven track record of success veteran discipline management team high performance corporate culture and excellence in execution so they're basically saying that their total addressable Market is 800 billion dollars over the next just three years so this is a massive Market that they are in and they have a first mover advantage and they're executing well""]"

(sighs) Oh, the travesty. (man crying) But here's the reality, according to GOBankingRates.com, over 69% of Americans do not have at least 1,000 dollars in their savings account. So if getting a tax refund is the only way that they can actually save money, then so be it. Because chances are people were not getting that tax refund then they were takin' that money outta their paycheck. It's not like they're actually going to invest it because people kind of struggling with their money stuff. So are tax refunds really that evil? No, no. Sorry Suze. All right bad advice number five. And that is renting is throwing away money. And another way you can look at this is that your home is your most valuable asset. And I get it, if you had a balance sheet and you've been paying off your mortgage for a number of years, your home might look like your biggest asset.

dollars and nine cents I want you guys to take some notes on that one we will revisit it in about about two weeks volume is down 22 percent today which again tells me it's in a cooling off phase let's take a moment let's step back and talk about the markets and the big picture I've been comparing this current recession that we've been in to pass recessions and the one that's beginning for it to resemble in performance is the 2008 Great Recession if that comparison is correct then later in this year the markets could have another 50 percent down move from where it's sitting at now there are some data points that don't align though such as the fact that some sectors of the economy are still showing signs of strength such as Manufacturing in the labor market what is aligning the most is how the stock market has been trading similar to how it traded back then I think the reason we got people like Michael burry who successfully called the past financial crisis is because he obviously is seeing some of the same things that I'm looking at in the charts right now I don't want you to get it mixed up even though the markets are bullish right now there's a lot of people looking at the same things and realizing that we are not out of the woods one of the charts I've recently been studying is selling pressure the market shows us that the June low was actually the peak of selling pressure since the recession began now we know that later in October the markets dropped further but not at the same level of selling pressure this is all about momentum when the markets see that the level capitulates like we saw in June that typically should Mark the bottom of an average recession and it could be seen as a valid Buy Signal to begin to go into accumulation phase for investing when the markets got that signal back in January of 2008 the Great Recession after the markets had dropped for most of 2007 when that signal fired in 2008 that was only the beginning of the bear Market ahead but many began to load up and get back into their desired positions people were buying back then only for the markets to later completely fall off the edge could the same thing be setting up to happen now that is what I'm watching carefully each and every day one of the confirmations that I'm seeing that reminds me of this being very similar to The Great Recession back in 2008-2009 is that this time when we got the moment of capitulation in June that should have marked the bottom of the move and we shouldn't be breaking that low but we've seen that we saw deeper lows in October and then big Tech in December we saw it get to 52-week lows we should have climbed from June until now which we've not I just wanted to throw that out there for you guys today get some feedback from you I'm going to cover this more in a future video If you haven't been winning in these markets and the last two weeks I just want to say don't get discouraged there is always always money to be made on Wall

photos on their phone right like it doesn't have to be professional photographers lots of people sell presets geared towards hobbyists and instagramers who want to edit their photos on their phone now to sell your presets you can use a marketplace like filter grade that will help streamline the process of marketing and selling the product these services usually take a percentage of your sales so if you're looking to actually keep all of your profit you should instead sell them on your own website or e-commerce shop overall a super cool way to make money with an evergreen digital product so that brings us to the next digital product which is selling social media templates this includes things like instagram story templates content creating media kits or really any template that will help anyone on social media for example you could sell templates for real estate agents that need better advertising for their properties on social media the reason why people buy these social media templates is for two reasons one they don't want to take the time to learn how to use photoshop which is what most people assume is needed even with free and easy to use platforms like canva people don't have the time to spend creating and designing their own posts which is where you come in especially with the growing number of professionals joining social media platforms the demand for these types of templates will continue to go up and up and as you guys know i love selling things that are trending upwards in demand like all other digital products you need to invest time to create the templates upfront"", ""so yeah by no means are they high ticket digital products which is good because it makes it way easier to sell similar to the notion templates you'll find that it becomes lucrative once you start selling packages bundles and add-ons that give people even more value which of course will allow you to charge an even higher price another cool thing about creating pdfs is that you don't actually have to make money off of it right away you can instead offer it for free as a lead magnet when people sign up on your website so that you can grow your email marketing list and make a profit later down the line with other digital products if you want to get started with selling pdfs the easiest ways to design them are through websites like canva google slides and also using programs like keynote once you've finished designing you can export it into a pdf and upload it onto your website your course or a platform like thinkific gumroad or etsy overall it's a really solid way to get into the digital space with very little overhead plus pdfs on average are way easier to make than many of the other digital products we're talking about in this video next is digital art which encompasses any artwork that you sell digitally online you can create logos for youtube channels or brands you can create and sell downloadable patterns or wallpaper that people can purchase and the reason why these are so much better than selling physical art is that you're once again leveraging the power of the internet meaning your art can be shown to pretty much the entire world now there's so many different ways that you can sell your artwork but the one i'm going to focus on in this video is just selling digital arts on a platform like etsy when putting your digital art up for sale there are two main ways that you can list it either as an instant download or made to order an instant download would be an image that immediately becomes available after they purchase it and a made to order is when you have custom digital art that will take time to customize and make before sending it to the purchaser now definitely prefer instant downloads because you have the ability to make fully passive income that has zero product cost but of course if you want to charge more per order you can definitely go down the custom print rep there's so many people out there selling their digital arts and"", ""but after that they can sell over and over with zero product costs to you and you're really saving people a ton of time by supplying them with these types of templates which means you can charge a good amount for them the process is very simple if you use a platform like canva to create all of your templates because you have tons of click and drag elements so you don't need to be a design expert at all there's also programs like photoshop and illustrator that take a long time to master but if you want the easiest program to use i just recommend going with canva focus on making targeted templates for specific people so for example you can make instagram story templates for specific niches like real estate agents loan originators and other entrepreneurs these types of people are the ones joining social media professionally for the first time and they're absolutely going to be looking for these types of templates it makes sense because if they buy a template all they have to do is plug in their own text and pictures to have a social media post in under a minute next up is fonts and i think that this is one that you guys use a lot but don't realize you can actually sell your own font as a product preferences and fonts are constantly changing so if you're someone that can create fonts you're in luck more than 600 000 companies are being made every year and with everyone moving to an online business model there will be a huge demand for new fonts if you guys are into graphic design then this could be a really great way for you to experiment with your artistic creativity while also making a good amount of passive income per month the average price for a font is about 30 let's say you do a hundred sales per month that's going to equate to three thousand dollars which is amazing if you don't care about keeping 100 of sales but want more exposure you can also sell it through an online font reseller like creative market where you keep between 10 to 70 i know selling fonts sounds a little bit out there but you can really make a living off of it depending on how much effort you put in for example jeremy vesey makes six figures per year selling fonts on creative market it's definitely a strenuous process to create a font and it's definitely a skill you need to perfect but like every other product on this list it's a crate once get continuous sales 24 7 type of deal and your buyers can come from anywhere in the world making the market absolutely massive for our next digital product we have spreadsheets these include documents calculator spreadsheets and any template that helps do conversions or calculations billions of people use spreadsheets every day and because of this you can actually make a ton of money selling them some popular templates that have been created are ones to help people with bookkeeping dieting expenses data sets and more the problem is that many of the applications out there like microsoft excel or google sheets can get very advanced which is why you see tons of influencers on tick tock and youtube starting accounts dedicated to teaching others how to use it if you're curious about whether there really is an interest in this market take a look at miss excel or your excel friend on tiktok their videos generate tens and even sometimes hundreds of thousands of views for their excel tutorials which i'll admit are extremely helpful i can also see these types of tutorials being helpful if you're a college student taking an excel class as well as anyone that's just you know looking to make your life easier if you guys are already in a certain niche i guarantee you that you can create spreadsheets to help people if you're in real estate you can create

dipped a little bit lower the bond price dipped our yield would have been a bit higher we could have jumped in and bought then and ultimately our returns would have been better than the 10 because we would have paid a lower price and either way we know we're getting back the 100 at the end of the day so speaking specifically to people who are looking at or investors who are looking at their portfolio and saying hey I own these different Bond ETFs and I'm buying them for safety I'm buying them for security one thing you might consider doing is perhaps not owning the ETF itself perhaps tips the treasury inflation protected securities we talked about before are a great investment but there really only as good as we're willing to hold them to maturity if we have to buy a bond and we buy the bond ETF and then things don't go the way we expected from a macroeconomic standpoint that can hurt us but if we buy a five-year Bond or a two-year Bond or a 20-year Bond and we hold it to maturity assuming in this case the U.S government can pay us back at the end of the 20 years we know today exactly what those returns are going to be if they're enough for the safety part of our portfolio that we need that could be a very good move now for me I'm more focused on stocks and longer term investing I'm trying to get bigger returns than even what today's bonds are are paying us so for me I'm trying to focus on stocks with that in mind let me tell you real quick about a website that we're building where it will be different we're going to we're building a platform that allows us to Value companies quickly and easily now we've already built the discounted cash flow version of the platform and we're gradually going to introduce a bunch of different ways to Value different types of stocks different ways that are good for different companies based on their own economic profile based on their own financials so ideally we could punch in the ticker of a company like a Tesla and it will the website will kick back some of the best ways to value that stock what the fair value is using that valuation method guiding us as to whether or not we should consider investing in it or really consider researching it more or maybe a bank discounted cash flow doesn't work for a bank but it could work but Price to Book value press the tangible Book value these could be ways that work very very well companies like apple discount cash flow would be perfect for that it's a large Blue Chip company very reliable free cash flow that could be a great way discounted cash flow is a great way to do it that's already working we got the beta version of the website up now the advantage of signing up today before the the whole website is done being built is that we are locking in the price for anybody who signs up today"", ""well we got a comment where somebody had put up where they explained that they invested in treasury ETFs so uh tip CTS which is treasury inflation protected securities tips for short now there's a tips ETF that is the I shares tips ETF and basically the higher inflation goes the more yield we get the better the dividends we get in that particular ETF given how high inflation has been and given how bad the stock market has been well you would think that the bond market would be a good place to invest the issue the real issue is that Bond ETFs are different so let's jump into why so this is a chart of the returns of that very same tips ETF so each bar represents a single month and it's looking back over the past five or six years and basically what it's doing is if the bar is green this that ETF was up in that given month if the bar is read the ETF was down in that given month over this entire time period Well the total return was about up 8.4 percent when if we annualize those numbers that means we returned about 1.3 percent per year which is logical given where interest rates have been and what we would expect to return from a government treasury investment we would expect it to be low but we would expect it to be safe over that entire time period that made a lot of sense but now what would happen if we were to Overlay interest rates on top of this chart so this orange line is the Fed funds rate that is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve sets the target interest rate on an overnight basis and basically when you hear Hey the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 75 basis points this is the interest rate that they're talking about but before we go any further there's one important point that is going to make all of this come together if we are either already invested in a bond ETF or if we're thinking about investing in Bonds in general and that is how bonds are tied to yields so we can see that the yield the orange line is the yield the interest rate that is being that is being paid out by the government so the if the price of a bond goes up the yield goes down always that's the way it works assuming the yield stays the same assuming the interest payment stays the same and in bonds they do if the yield go if the price goes down the yield goes up the two act inversely so they're it's sort of like a seesaw effect now that's very important because if you were to buy a bond and interest rates after you bought the bond go higher well people are probably going to sell the bond that you have driving the price down and they're going to buy the bond with the higher yield so your price goes down because that's the bond we owe people are selling that more sellers the price goes down"", ""in this video we're going to look at the basics of a bond what it is and how you can make money investing in it we're gonna look at two real-life examples one from Nike and one from Kroger a bond is a loan you make to the company let's look at some examples here are the details for a Nike bond and here are the details for a Kroger bond we're gonna keep this simple let's imagine you're going to invest $1,000 worth of each bond here's an overview of how a typical bond would work when a bond is first issued it has on it what is called par value or face value typically that's a hundred or thousand dollars so let's imagine you invest a thousand dollars on that day in return what you will receive is interest payments usually twice a year let's assume the coupon rate on that bond is 10 percent that would mean if you invest a thousand dollars you would receive $100 a year or $50 every six months that's typically the way it works twice a year you would receive this until the maturity date were on the maturity date in addition to your final interest payment you would receive back the par value of the bond in this case a thousand dollars so in looking at the Nike bond the three point eight 75% tells you that for the thousand dollars invested you would receive thirty eight dollars and seventy five cents for the kroger bond the seven point five percent coupon tells you would receive seventy-five dollars a year if you look at the price of each the Nike bond is trading at one hundred and two point four while the kroger bond is trading at one hundred and thirty point three why the difference people have flooded into the kroger bond that is paying seven and a half percent the more people that buy it the higher the price goes so what does this mean for you as an investor the hundred and thirty point three means it would cost you one thousand three hundred and three dollars for the same thousand dollars worth of a bond while the Nike bond will cost you one thousand twenty four dollars the advantage of buying the kroger is if you pay thirteen hundred and three dollars you will receive 75 dollars a year versus the thousand twenty four dollars for Nike we are only going to receive thirty eight seventy five a year no matter what the price you pay you're going to receive the interest payments based on the par value of the bond and at the end of the bond when the bond matures you're going to receive back that par value also known as the face value that's the purpose of investing in bonds it's steady it's consistent and in theory it's safer than stocks if you

$2 or $3 and that might be enticing but if you don't know the company you know how good the execution is gonna be on those trades another thing you just don't know if that company is insured by the SI pc so make sure it's a thing that you recognize it could be Scottrade e Trade TD Ameritrade there are many different choices the second thing you want to figure out is what are you actually going to be buying online is it stocks ETFs mutual funds all the different online brokers have their little niches that they focus on for example if you're looking for stocks purely stocks each ray t v--

stocks but want to focus on dividend reinvestment capital one share builder is another great resource to go to and the last thing you want to focus on is fees mostly the online brokers are really cheap in their fees but make sure there's nothing on the back end they're going to try to ding you on for example do they have an annual account fee or an annual maintenance fee are they going to charge you if you transfer your account out do they charge for advice if you have a question you want to call their toll-free number is there additional cost hopefully this isn't an add-on just an additional service that they provide so if you have a question you're not going to get charged for it if you're not sure what the best online stock broker is for you be sure to head over to the site

Morningstar foreign trading some brokers offer the ability to convert money in your account into foreign currencies in order to trade on international stock exchanges if this is important to you make sure the broker you choose allows this trading platforms the various brokerages offer a wide variety of trading software and mobile apps and many actually allow people to test out their platforms before opening account for example fidelity offers a demo version of its active trader pro platform for prospective clients to test drive also read some reviews of brokers mobile apps if being able to access your account on-the-go is important to you convenience some brokers have large networks of local branch offices you can visit for face-to-face investment guidance while others do not for example Merrill edge customers can get one-on-one advice and guidance at more than 2,000 Bank of America locations also brokerage is operated by banks offer customers the ability to connect their

policies in an increasingly interconnected world naturally shifted capital away from boring first world financial centers and towards new exciting economies like china brazil and indonesia to take advantage of this obvious trend wealthy investors poured money into emerging market etfs and mutual funds through the late 2000s in their mind providing capital that would accelerate the inevitable

trends in developing economies the world bank declared growth in developing countries stock markets will be enhanced as policies liberalizing trade and investment regulations realigning exchange rates consolidating public financings and continuing privatization are implemented as with el aryan the world bank's prediction may indeed have come to pass as today's global economy features liberal trade policies investment deregulation and aligned exchange rates but in a key sense we noticed the world bank was wrong these changes simply did not drive equity returns moreover these em equities underperform their developed market equivalence despite a higher gdp growth according to imf the average annual gdp growth in emerging economies was 4.7 versus 1.8 percent for developed economies the disappointing results for em equity investors were even worse for investors who specifically thought to invest in em growth stocks which in theory should have benefited the most from the sort of realignment el aryan and the world bank described these stocks were in fact the major cause of em underperformance as em value stocks delivered returns on par with the S&P500 hundred dollars in em growth stocks in 1989 would have been worth less than half of the same investment in the S&P500 or an em value stocks taken together these insights paint a bleak picture for emerging market equity investing over the past 30 years over this period emerging market investors took on more risk for less reward while being unable to capture the benefits of gdp growth in these economies the frequency and severity of emerging market crises help explain both slow growth and high volatility in emerging market equity in 1989 emerging economies have experienced significantly more crises than their developed counterparts as measured by the percentage drawdown in these equity markets not only are these crises more frequent in emerging markets they're also more severe when crises occur in

classes introduction pundits prognosticators and even investment boards often make misleading declarations that an asset class is broken that its prospects for earning investors a reasonable future return are very dim these proclamations can lead to investors abandoning these assets to chase recent winners advisors are uniquely positioned to educate their clients about historical asset class returns and to provide context for recent perhaps disappointing performance in this way advisors can prepare their clients for substantial variations in an assets returns a prepared client is a confident one and confidence begets the tenacity to hold assets over the long term raising the likelihood of a successful investment experience via diversification rebalancing and long-term compounding and isn't that what financial advice is all about warnings of the long-term impaired viability of asset classes have spooked investors through history one of the most notorious was businessweek's cover story the death of equities published in 1979 u.s stocks are not alone however other quote-unquote broken asset classes abound by the late 1990s reits were dismissed as losing the power to diversify a portfolio and a 1999 article in the economists concluded cheap oil is likely to remain so fast forward 20 years to the present headlines team with sentiments such as does investing in emerging markets still make sense and is value investing dead it might be and here's what killed it so history is littered with examples of reputable pundits media outlets and prognosticators cautioning investors about broken asset classes typically at the heels of sagging absolute returns or poor results relative to mainstream markets similar warnings also occurred during investment board meetings in his consulting days john recalls back in february 2000 a board meeting of an 800 million pension fund recent market movements namely growth stock outperformance had pushed the fund's asset allocation out of compliance with its investment policy statement requiring a larger balance out of growth stocks into core bonds and small cap value the resistance to the mandated rebalance was unsurprisingly for those who may have lived through this period stiff with one board member stating that small cap value is a dead asset class indeed it appeared the board preferred to eliminate small cap value rather than top it up fortunately the investment policy statement compelled the rebalance to go through and to this day john will tell you it was one of his most rewarding experiences in investment management given the absolute dollar value created for the funds members as growth stocks plunged small value stocks surged and bonds steadily advanced during the bear market that eventually culminated in late 2002 when headlines lead to clients questioning their investment strategy we suggest advisors use comprehensive historical return ranges to most effectively gauge recent results on an absolute basis and relative to a mainstream asset such as u.s equities that is the S&P500 index we will review how seemingly impaired assets are rarely permanently defunct in most cases the performance of a broken asset class is well within its range of historical returns and outperformance often follows a period of underperformance as mean reversion takes hold clients benefit from a greater understanding of the potential long-term upside in recently beaten down assets the broken asset classes before delving into our review let's begin with a few caveats first our selection of broken asset classes is far from exhaustive in making our selection we relied primarily on a global roster of historical articles published in the well-established financial press including businessweek barons the economist and financial times if your own experience includes other asset classes that have been declared broken please let us know second the headlines or conversations that question the long-term viability of an asset class represent just one opinion or voice at that time alongside those who warn and question others may have presented an opposite more favorable view contrarians are often an endangered species but rarely extinct given our survey's purpose is to show how broken asset classes typically mend themselves with time our sample emphasizes the former these are the same troubled asset classes that grab the headlines grip the attention of investors and lead to tough questions for advisors from their clients and finally we are restricted by the availability of return data although we use well-known proxies with an extended return history few asset classes other than u.s stocks and high-yield bonds have a monthly series longer than a half-century a notable example is emerging market stocks in our study we use a return history for em stocks that begins in 1985."", ""approximately half of the group commodities high-yield bonds and value stocks generated negative returns that fell within the worst decile of each assets long-term historical three-year rolling return these are disappointing infrequent outcomes but they are not atypical or improbable broadly performance results relative to the S&P500 tended to be more severe than absolute outcomes suggesting that anchoring on mainstream assets is pervasive for instance three asset classes reits small value stocks and em stocks managed to deliver returns slightly above their long-term median levels in the three years preceding the declaration's warning that they were defunct but when viewed relative to mainstream assets all three suffered relative shortfalls trailing u.s stocks by up to 14 percent a year over the three-year period preceding their respective warning dates they are not alone every asset class in our subset except for one trailed the S&P500 in the three years leading up to the warning date the three-year relative losses of four of the five stragglers fell into the worst quintile of all historical outcomes with two in the bottom decile so despite alarming warnings of the impaired viability of asset classes the performance of broken asset classes is not particularly exceptional generally falling within the normal albeit bottom range of return outcomes mean reversion and missed opportunities far too many investors focus on the rearview mirror and react to fear-inducing headlines doing so incurs the risk that investors will miss good opportunities markets are supposed to pay a risk or fear premium to reward risk bearing perception of risk and fear tend to go hand in hand asset classes get sold down to bargain levels because people are fearful and as our colleague rob arnott regularly says when risks and bad news are known to the market and fears prevalent it's time to buy what's out of favor unloved and legitimately creating fear fear-based anomalies persist because their genesis is in humans primal impulses in the five years after an asset class was declared broken each roared back in a strong and for many swift rebound all except one snapped back within one year generating returns that ranged from 14 for u.s stocks to 68 percent for commodities the sole doddler reits rebounded in 18 months ultimately delivering a cumulative 86 percent return at the five-year mark the weakest performance of the group we recognize the substantial survivorship bias in our survey having personally survived most of these episodes ourselves so to be more comprehensive we also plot other periods when these asset classes fell within their lowest decile of historical three-year rolling absolute returns a similar pattern unfolds a large majority or 88 percent of all observations deliver a positive five-year return the average five-year cumulative return across all observations is eighty percent or approximately twelve percent a year suggesting both the presence and strength of mean reversion how do the asset classes perform on a relative basis recall that the broken asset classes in our survey had mostly fallen short of the performance of the S&P500 in the years leading up to the proclamation they were broken in the subsequent three years these asset classes surpassed the performance of u.s stocks on a cumulative basis by an average of 45 percent or 13 a year after five years the cumulative excess return of reits commodities small value stocks and high-yield bonds versus the S&P500 averaged 101 percent or 15 percent a year over this five-year span the four asset classes fared significantly better than u.s stocks with cumulative access returns ranging from 10 percent high yield bonds to 158 percent for commodities the press is often quick to label asset classes broken but rarely is this the case although exceptions do exist for instance the german and russian stock markets during world war one japanese and german stock markets during world war ii and the egyptian stock market in the early 1950s all collapsed the near obliteration of a stock market has happened but it is an extraordinary occurrence the advisor's role we are hardwired to pay attention to headlines with fear-provoking warnings it's easy to fall prey to now casts and believe that what's already happened is a forecast of more of the same while such predictions may sound cogent they rarely offer insight our simple survey of broken asset classes reveals the following observations first warnings of the impaired viability of asset classes tends to be exaggerated the three-year performance leading up to the time that an asset class is pronounced broken is typically within the normal albeit wide range of historical return outcomes and second returns are time varying and rebounds can be strong after assets are either declared broken or declined to their lowest historical decile of three-year outcomes the majority or 90 rebound within five years the recovery also tends to be meaningful the average cumulative five-year subsequent return across all observations is 80 or 12 a year our primary point is not to conclusively say that bottom decile performance will be succeeded by brilliant subsequent returns our survey is simply not comprehensive and even if it was the future will not exactly mimic the past rather our intent is to highlight how the advisor is uniquely positioned to prepare clients for the wide range of absolute and relative returns that capital markets will inevitably throw at them in most cases parroting mark twain reports of asset class deaths are greatly exaggerated but sadly these misleading proclamations can lead to investors abandoning these assets to chase recent winners these types of poor investment decisions can be prevented however with proper preparation such as educating clients about historical asset class returns to provide context for recent perhaps disappointing performance this is particularly important with diversifying assets as compared to the more traditional asset classes of stocks and investment grade bonds by definition the role of diversifiers such as high-yield bonds and commodities is not to mimic mainstream markets like the S&P500 actor richard klein once said confidence is preparation everything else is beyond your control recent spans of market tumult has certainly taught us that returns are well outside of our control but an advisor can prepare their clients for substantial variations and in assets returns and obtain buy-in for these wide and ultimately unknowable ranges a prepared client is a confident one and confidence begets long-termism and long-termism helps tune out the noise and raises the likelihood of a successful investment experience via diversification rebalancing and long-term compounding and isn't that what financial advice is all about""]"

squeeze setup it was following the fifth iteration of a cycle of momentum that we've seen in the last two years at the same time that shorts were covering my thought process was we were looking for proof of concept that the squeeze setup would actually fulfill what needs to happen in order to well actually realize a tradable squeezy mcsqueezy and since our video on the 24th it has had a hero's journey that's taken it back and forth and overall allowed appreciation of 45 to highest as of the end of last week it's now broken past each of the previous three cycle highs and declared a higher resistance deep into the eights its sell-off towards close took it to support that was around where the previous highs had been at which means you have very solid proof of concept in terms of momentum continuing you pull up the short interest short interest as a percentage of free float is now higher than at any point in the last year according to ortex interestingly enough when we last spoke about mr blue apron shorts were in the process of covering which helps start the massive rebound in prices because they have to buy back shares to cover but since then shorts have actually decided to reverse course which is quite juicy and short interest is around double what it was when we covered it last it is now at 53 percent of free float"", ""so our top trade idea right now is MF Miss fresh very fresh indeed some would say fresh eat though this fresh is in the consumer defensive space and they are trading at just a lick just a little lick above 52 two week laws despite having a pretty solid fundamental picture behind them I often like to find the most damning charts for my top trade ideas because if you can find stocks that the market has almost unanimously given up on and has unanimously decided that they don't want to touch and at the same time the company attached to that ticker if it has an actual business model even if it's not insane but if it has an operating business model well oftentimes that's all you need for a massive massive squeeze or at least the massive massive rally ralita sort of like an underdog Arbitrage situation where the stock is such an underdog that everybody hates it it looks so sketchy to touch no one wants to even look that way and when you have these Underdog trades well what happens is that if there's any sort of semblance of a business well that means there could be an insane Ricochet effect and you've already seen a lot of proof of concept of that during today's market hours and I think you're going to see more and more of these types of runs you go over to dilution tracker as you know I am allergic to two things in this world dilution and also penicillin but the second one's not relevant but dilution tracker says the overall risk is low offering ability is low dilution amount excluding shelf is low historical dilution is low and cash need is low in fact dilution tracker estimates the company has about 54.9 months of cash left so very solid from that standpoint if these numbers are correct now of course it's worth mentioning though that when you're talking about super small cap companies and you're talking about four and ones especially there can be a discrepancy between the reporting the estimates and what actually is going on and that's fine because in that discrepancy there's a lot of opportunity for trading and debate in the market to happen and that's where a lot of the fun comes in because you could trade off those moves if everything was clear and everybody had decided on evaluation of a stock well it would be flat there'd be no opportunities it's where you get into these really really small caps and some of these sketchier areas of the market where people a lot of people don't want to touch that's where you get a lot of those rally rally toe opportunities it's also where you get a lot of risk though right got to keep that in mind but anywho if you're looking at the dilution tracker numbers looks pretty good now this is a company that did their original IPO with JPMorgan City cicc and China Renaissance in mid-2021 that was at a price of 13 and the offering amount was 273 million now in days though even after today's run well the stock is trading at a market cap of just 6.39 million dollars that's a really really far cry right sure things have been bad in the super small cap

right let's go back in time a little bit and talk about the history of Sofi we're going to time travel here in the charts on November of 2020 this thing launched at ten dollars a share and within two months it shot up 200 percent reaching its all-time high of around 29 over the next year though the price moved in a wide price range could look like distribution to some rising and falling between 12 and 24 after which It ultimately entered into a decline phase and for the first six months of 2022 it actually fell around 80 percent all the way from the high of 24 down to the low right below five dollars and for the rest of 2022 and for the first four months of 2023 it's been essentially moving sideways possibly in an accumulation phase five dollars has served as the low of that range eight dollars has served as the high in the last year though Sofi has repeatedly beat their earnings expectations but to the disappointment of the shareholders the stock only responds by selling off and it still remains within that range if you go back and you look at the charts that you see every single time before earnings Sofi tends to ramp up with positive expectation only to sell off after they beat earnings and it's not like this is a company that's struggling the CEO actually continues to raise guidance but the market just doesn't care is Sofi worth investing in or should you expect more shareholder pain I'm gonna get into some fundamentals I'm going to show you guys some things in the charts"", ""now we're going to take your ten dollars of earnings multiply it by 10 a multiple and now your company is only worth 100 this is an example of multiple compression how 50 of the share price of a company has evaporated simply because the market is less willing to pay for those earnings now some like michael bury warn us that the price to earnings crash is only half of the battle and that we face another problem and that is the problem of eps write downs remember in this example if your stock made ten dollars and you received a multiple of ten you would get one hundred dollars as your share price but while we wrote down the price to earnings multiple what happens if we now have to come in here and say ah crap we're not making ten dollars anymore because we're in a recession well now folks you have phase two of a bear market and that is the write down of earnings per share now credit suisse provides us some excellent research they say that valuation compression which is a fancy way of saying it price to earnings multiple that first part may be complete and they suggest that now phase one of our bear market is driven by d ratings on the back of higher rates and recession concerns again fancy really fancy big word way of saying that forward price to earnings multiples are now roughly in line with where they should be in a decline in fact you could say see this here in their price to earnings model suggesting that the decline in valuations is complete that we have seen market signals this dark gray line align with actual price to earnings projections this is a very good thing again it means that the first half is complete however if you take a look at this chart we can see that in the 1990 recession followed by the dot-com bubble followed by the recession the great recession in 2008 and followed by the covid recession in every single one of these instances we have seen price to earnings multiples decline an average of 25.9 and by some degree we've already exceeded that with a decline of 28.8 percent but take a look at forward earnings per share projections in 1990 earnings per share projections how much your lemonade stand is making came down seven point nine percent in two thousand seventeen point eight percent in the great recession thirty eight point nine percent and in the coveted recession twenty one point three percent with an average of 21.5 percent of decline well how much from peak to trough have forward earnings per share declined in the current bear market folks the answer is zero that means we still have to go through the pricing of a reduction of earnings per share and all of this is happening at the same time that our recession risks are being complicated by wages continuing to be strong employment continues to be strong as we saw in the june jobs report that just came out in july we saw that we're still

the client likes palantir's platform which we know they do most of the time well they'll go and start spending more and more money with palantir and then all of a sudden the whole transaction is very very profitable the problem though and why Wall Street doesn't like palantir most of the time is because if palantir is onboarding a lot of clients demoing a lot of clients well they're going to take a lot more losses from these clients so wall Street's like wait don't try to get more clients just try to scale the clients that you already have the problem though is that if you do that you're not going to get the kind of growth that palantir needs and wants building on that the second Point here is profitability so again because palantir's business model is to scale in customers but lead with losses it means that their profitability tends to be pretty hampered but of course that's a short-term problem because if those customers scale well palantir makes a lot more money and you're starting to see proof of concept that this is exactly what palantir is doing and they're doing this very very successfully palantir reports we were profitable again this quarter in the period ending March 31st 2023 we earned a net profit of 17 million according to generally accepted accounting principles and we now anticipate that we will remain profitable each quarter through the end of the year in addition for the first time in our history we earned an operating profit last quarter we generated 525 million in Revenue in the first quarter a result that surpassed our initial guidance and yet still understates the magnitude of the opportunity in front of us"", ""so what does this say it says that palantir scaling so aggressively that now they are able to consistently improve not just Revenue but now also increasingly profitability obviously Wall Street believes that if a stock is invested in its future well that's a disaster and you need to short the hell out of that stock because guess what you shouldn't be invested in your future you need to be investing in making sure that those shareholders get some big dividends again if you're trying to find a stock that's going to grow they got to be invested in their future now the third reason that palantir is running right now is because of new Catalyst announcements new Partnerships for example palantir and the ministry of digital transformation of Ukraine struck a reconstruction partnership this morning each partnership is a new opportunity for the media to cover it and spread more awareness to the stock which tends to drive at least in this current cycle tends to drive more people into the stock and the price up now the fourth reason and perhaps the most happiest reason for why pltr is trading like a hype stock right now is because of the AI Trend in a year where chat GPT and AI related Trends have pushed stock after stock to new highs and pushed nvda back above all-time highs while any stock that is seen as an AI play will get a lot of extra capital in it and palantir has always been an AI play I mean its platforms literally segment the thousands to millions of data points and draw conclusions on how a company could improve efficiency however recent press releases have caused more emphasis to be placed on this as an AI stock specifically headlines like this where they're developing greater AI Partnerships with really really well-known big retail stores and endless other numbers of Industries as well now in totality and I said this earlier this week as well I don't think that palantir's earnings were anything crazy I just think that it reminded markets that hey palantir isn't a dying company it's actually doing what it's set out to do"", ""I mean they just beat revenues very nicely last quarter they obviously beat on EPS as well they put pretty low guidance out there my opinion so they could come in with a nice beat and we're looking at a company that on 2024 numbers is trading at a 2024 PE of roughly 36.37 and once again this is a company that's at the infant stage of profitability so when you're talking about a company that's at the infant stage of profitability that has among the best gross margins you'll find of any public company in the world I think I think it might be undervalued significantly and if we want to add a cherry on top in this whole situation look what Alex carp said the depth of Engagement with and demand for artificial intelligence platform is without precedent which means they just have overwhelming amount of either government clients commercial clients asking questions about their product looking in their product interest in their product and if that's the situation you're going to see massive amounts of closed deals for palantir over this next I would say 12 to 36 months and obviously once palantir gets in the door they got a pretty sticky business model there and they're likely going to keep uh you know the majority of these customers they attract those next 12 to 36 months now that everybody has to consider an AI plan for their companies""]"

With your position being larger, you're able to increase your profits and grow your portfolio a lot faster than if you were just spot trading. It's important to note, though, that trading on a leverage also increases your potential losses. So bigger losses, bigger gains.

Now, with my link below you actually get a sign up bonus so there is no reason not to use the link below when you create your new account right now.

They are massive."", ""But before you make a decision, you need to know the difference between the two options. USD margin is simply trading Futures with a specific stablecoin. This is done in either USDT or BUSD. Either coin is absolutely fine because they're both paired to the dollar. Coin margin Futures is Futures trading, but instead of using a stablecoin as your margin, you can choose one of your other coins as the underlying asset. What is the funding rate? Funding rate is a fee you pay to hold your position if it's open using a perpetual contract. This is how they can keep these contracts open without an expiry date. In comparison to delivery contracts, there is no funding rate at all because there is an expiry date. Funding rates are payments made to either long or short traders based on the difference in perpetual contracts, markets and spot prices. Traders will either pay or get funds based on open positions. Binance implements this rate every 8 hours. Funding rates are distributed from trader to trader. As a result, Binance takes no fees from funding rates because they occur directly between traders, depending on whatever the current market sentiment is."", ""They are very, very big. And they really want you to be responsible when trading because, of course, they have a reputation on the line. Binance Futures offers its customers a whole new trading experience, with many benefits compared to normal spot trading.

there's something that people aren't saying that I think is very important to comprehend if you guys want to know what we're talking about hit the like button if you enjoy these videos hit subscribe if you haven't done so yet there's quite a few of you out there that are watching these videos and you're not subscribed maybe you already subscribed when YouTube accidentally unsubscribed to you they do that sometimes so today we're talking about metamask and their terms and conditions uh you know it's funny because no one ever reads the terms and conditions and it you always can tell when someone has red terms and conditions for the first time because they're often shocked at what they're reading and in this time it was misunderstood and so basically metamask is owned by consensus and consensus offers a lot of different products some are able to be bought by you the end user and in their terms and conditions there was some language regarding taxes and they're basically saying if you buy one of our products we're going to charge you tax in your transaction sales tax that's basically what they're talking about but this was severely misunderstood and spread like wildfire across crypto Twitter and Reddit and all those good juicy places for crypto gossip that it was misunderstood that people were thinking that metamask was going to start withholding your taxes if you weren't paying them or if you weren't reporting your cryptocurrency transactions metamask would withhold your crypto until that was all cleared um that's not true they do not do this maybe that will happen in the future and that is the point of this video not fud just raising awareness of we tend to get used to abuse uh in any form of the matter it's really unfortunate that a lot of people make justifications because of convenience or they can put up with it and in this abuse I'm talking about government control and the issuance of I'm going to call them digital currencies not the free market cryptocurrencies that we know and love these are soon to come government issued digital currencies and the fact that so many people were worried that someone could have physical programmable control over their cryptocurrencies if they didn't play by the rules that scared them so much my friends this is a future that is coming um this is not Doom and Gloom"", ""yes this wouldn't actually really stop anything it wouldn't be stopping illicit actors and this would actually raise privacy concerns so again very good point now this next section is very important this actually shows that the congresswoman and congressmen they actually know what they're talking about they realize what this means self-hosted wallets enable owners to manage and protect the cryptographic private keys without the use of a third-party intermediary as such they represent a foundational component of innovative distributed ledger technology a subset of which is commonly known as blockchain that enables two parties to exchange value on a peer-to-peer basis over the internet in this sense use of a self-hosted wallet is effectively a digital cash transaction where trust is established directly between the sender and the recipient independent of any third party eliminating the middleman through the use of self-hosted wallets means that consumers can maintain privacy and transact freely which is critically important as individuals increasingly conduct their financial lives digitally such freedoms stand in stark contract to china's digital yen where citizens transactions are surveilled and transactions involving disfavored individuals or activities can be censored so basically the four are talking about how blockchain works they say that they don't want to turn the us into china where all transactions are surveillance and transactions involving certain individuals or activities can be censored they actually want to keep the blockchain they want to keep crypto free and that is very very powerful additionally the permissionless nature of digital assets inherent with self-hosted wallets has the potential to expand banking services to the unbanked and underbanked that is also very true there's a lot of nations out there and there's people in the u.s surprising that still does not have a bank account""]"

further into the project they say that our next major step in the roadmap is to go live with our beta testing on maintenance they should have been in the early part of quarter two which is where we are now and we'll be announcing further information on how this testing will take place over the next few weeks across our various social channels based on the success of this test period will be we will be aiming to go live with our first operator by the close of quarter 2 that is around the June end of June give or take also within the next quarter we expect to announce our first third-party games developer and begin integration this will coincide with the release of more original funfair slots games and updates to existing offerings if you have not checked their website they have a an area we can pretty much check and see the things that they plan on launching they said that they're not finalized yet but they wanted to give people an idea of what type of platform and what type of games they were going to have through funfair throughout quarter 2 and beyond our team will continue to represent the company at a number of international events on the gaming calendar where the trips to g2e Asia and a disruptive online gaming conference in London among the numerous dates in the diary they also say that they are going to try their darkness so they will start giving more information on the project so exactly what's going on and it continued and quicker pace on discord and on telegram because people always like to have information about the projects that they are getting into last stop this is another very interesting one and I'll explain a bit after mainstream Financial Analysts might be fixated on Bitcoin so called death cross which apparently Bitcoin cross earlier I don't know if you guys have pretty sure a lot of you have been looking at other people's cryptocurrency videos a lot of people have been showing this thing on a graph that Bitcoin was going to cross or pass the death cross it was an indicator that there was gonna be a gigantic downtrend and the currency would fall down and they also fall down and there are people on CNBC talking about that the price would go to $1000 and people talking about it would go to 1500 so the CEO of abre his name is Bill Barr hit bar height believes that another rally is just around the corner bar height who once designed trading systems for Goldman Sachs how business insider that hedge funds and other institutions are beginning to see crypto assets as a huge opportunity and that all hell will break loose once they begin investing in the non-sentient markets I talked to hedge funds high net worth individuals even commodity speculators they look at the volatility in the crypto markets and they see this as a huge opportunity once that happens all hell will break loose II said once the floodgates are opened they're opened there are a lot of if you look at I know they're not that easy to find but I look at these things kind of all day if I have nothing to do I'm always into watching things about crypto there are a lot of really rich people and they say that the number one reason that they're actually into crypto is because of the volatility you would expect that they would be staying away because you know the prices go up and down these people know how to work the markets they have people who work for them who know how to work the markets and they're making a tremendous amount of money day trading and using BOTS to trade because of the volatility in the market you may think that people are losing money when when prices go down and they are not because they have people and BOTS like I said before who know exactly what they're doing and how to play the market so that they get money even as the market goes down he says the institution of interest is already starting to tick up in Japan which he said is a leading indicator of what will soon happen in the West regardless of retail interest which has seen a sharp decline in recent months there really is a zero large scale there really is ZERO large scale institution to money from the West and crypto right now this is already happening Japan once a large sizable chunk of Western institution and money starts to come in watch out this is probably going to happen once we get all the regulations in place Japan and South Korea and I may be one or two other places they know or have been told by their governments what these coins are what is this what is that their SEC has already jumped in and said what is going to be what it's pretty much down to Europe and the us who are pretty much saying that they will tell everybody sometime around June what all these things are not sure how many of you have been with me in this channel for a very long time this is what I was talking about before we there is no there's no rich money in the market yet everything that has kind of flown in has come from normal investors that's you and me and other people who are just trying to make an extra buck on the side once we have billionaires actually dumping their money into this this will not happen until they have proper framework for exactly what's going on like I've said before in other videos you will not have someone dump 500 million dollars into the market until they know exactly what they're going to have to pay in taxes

it really break free from that institutionalization and get out there into the world where and then involved into what we have now research and finance is similar you know Big Data people talk about that all the time but they don't really know exactly what they're saying other than the word to Big Data but in terms of it trade ideas and what we've been doing since we never gave up our mission from that initial dot-com revolution we've continued to do the same thing that we were doing before just continuing to research in the field of if you weren't a robo advised person or if you didn't have your money managed that someone else's behalf or discretion how would you do it what would be the approach that you would take to quote-unquote beat the market or at least certainly try to do better than averages which seems like it shouldn't be that difficult that was really our bottom line assumption why is it that everyone has such a hard time beating the averages I think it's a question that a lot of institutions really never ask themselves because they're more interested in getting fees under management than the actual percentages and returns it's all about the fees versus the results well we changed that we're not a broker or not an advisor we're a technology company a research company and we're giving you artificial intelligence that thinks it's a human and tries to be a very disciplined human investor has access to ever social data all the fundamental data all of the price data of course and the kind of software and technology that's been developed from scratch just for this particular purpose we of course know that not everybody necessarily wants to be just simply trading artificial intelligence which is why of course here you have the Netflix for investing

different set of tools so for trade ideas were keep you know we're here to help fulfill brokers we're here to help brokers fill their brand promises and someone do some of them are doing it better

that we've had in the innovation that we've spent and the recognition that we've received as Dan walked through some of the accolades from this year and from years past we were already in conversations with different brokers to bring this technology you can create a halo effect for them and to serve their clients and ours by bringing machine learning artificial intelligence as an analyst as an advisor into the trading decision process and we'll have more brokers buying to do that with us as we as we launch these innovations that dan mentioned about the paper trading we'll also in turn be working on our own API connectivity so that we can bring brokers into the trade ideas platform and those using a platform can just simply direct their trades to the brokers that they have accounts with and in this thing in this way we see ourselves as kind of a lending tree for online retail brokers and professionals and and any other brokerage that is looking to present this technology to their clients and by doing so we'll be able to further educate and differentiate within the offerings of how brokers are using trade ideas to say a tea trade it looks like this TD

desktop showing you the trade ideas artificial intelligence one-of-a-kind technology that lives on our website and of course you can download it through our application trade ideas Pro AI this is what it does that that's different from other vendors in finance so the idea is that we find these statistical opportunities that are triggered by either past analysis that the AI has done or read more recent specific statistical setups today but the bottom line is if you look at the percentages the percentage opportunities that were able to find it's pretty evident that even when you take small losses which you have there is no technology that gives individuals the kind of opportunities and the percentages that are possible with what we're doing at trade ideas which then I have to just ask myself it's crazy that the online brokers haven't even done the research to take a look at what we're doing nobody's really bothered to even spend the time to see if it works or if it doesn't that's the thing that probably is the oddest to us the innovators in in FinTech and in big data and artificial intelligence that is that primarily all the innovation all the interest has been on the individual side because obviously there's no vendor that provides this kind of tech it's ironic that you know I remember in the 90s when Schwab was so worried about how technology could be disruptive

drawdowns experienced for winners in the prior decade this type of analysis of past performance can't help predict which firms will succeed in the future nevertheless the research points out a clear correlation between possession of these measurable characteristics and long-term performance by looking at firms outcomes decade by decade Professor bessembinder provides patterns of evidence suggesting that over long-term Horizons returns follow fundamentals this means that the firms that perform best are those that quickly grow their assets and accumulate cash and profits are a key element here whether it's a high returning young company or a wealth generating mature company spending more in research and development is key to profitability investors should deploy Capital into the growth company's likeliest to generate Capital returns the professor's analysis makes these companies easier to spot lesson two is to expect drawdowns long-term investors in top performing companies must have the stomach for large Peak to trough share price declines two examples highlighted in the paper were emblematic of this apple and Amazon in the case of Apple The company generated more than 1.6 trillion dollars in shareholder wealth between 1981 and 2019."", ""but it too has had episodes of volatility and steep drawdowns such as during the tech bust when there were skepticisms following the post-tech burst relapse and the launch of prime and during the global financial crisis these precipitous episodes can be deeply worrying and behaviorally fraught to navigate both for companies and for shareholders recent Bender's research shows that this pattern is often repeated across a range of the largest wealth creating companies it's not news that even top returning companies are prone to severe drawdowns however Professor bassenbinder's research reveals the severity and length of some of these periods of falling value investment managers must therefore tolerate occasional volatility in pursuit of big long-term gains as share prices often reflect investors anticipating each other's next move the share price of a listed company sometimes has a remote relationship with the business it represents this suggests that investors shouldn't seek to just be different from the index but to ignore it the focus should instead be on the fundamental progress of a business so this brings us to the third lesson that we've taken from Hank bessenbender's work being aware of the biases associated with long-term winners looking at the breakdown of sectors within the research and the propensity of winners to have come from different sectors historically is quite revealing just because tax docs have been some of the strongest performers it doesn't follow that companies in that category have an outsized chance of Extreme Performance Professor bessembinder's research actually reveals the opposite to be true it's easy to see how these shortcuts and mental shortcuts can be formed seven of the top 10 wealth creating companies in the US between 1950 and 2019 are technology companies however technology companies are also underrepresented in the top 200 wealth creating firms whilst areas such as energy and Communications have been more greatly represented so perceptions of Industries can be misleading investors should beware the assumptions and mental shortcuts they use in describing top winners and what drives them industry definitions don't help and they often oversimplify Amazon for example is not just a tech company but a tech enabled retail company amongst many other activities what's needed is a careful study of individual firms and their competitors the best approach is to build relations with Founders and managers to help assess their chances of success in concluding it's fantastic to share these learnings with you in the Quest for winners focus on growth expect drawdowns and beware your biases our work with Professor basenbinder continues and there's much more that we're excited to learn and to explore here at Bailey Gifford huge thanks to Hank bessenbender for his fantastic research and our interactions thank you very much for listening and thank you to the member Faber show for the invitation to contribute to the podcast have a great day foreign"", ""The Next Step was to sift through vast volumes of company data over a much longer time frame to discover the common characteristics of those big winners the professor's work looked at the wealth creation of companies over 10-year periods as the data covers many decades some companies were measured multiple times over their lifetimes This research revealed surprising things about successful companies insights that make these companies easier to spot and to hold over time there are three key lessons that I'd like to summarize here to focus on growth to expect drawdowns and to beware biases so lesson one is to focus on growth investing in research and development while still achieving Superior growth in returns scale and profitability is a key characteristic of winning companies firms succeed or fail for Myriad reasons but this appears to be a must-have Professor bassenbinder's new Research into successful firms stems from his discovery of how over a longer time frame very few companies have made a big difference between 1926 and 2019 there was a 47 trillion dollar additional growth and wealth of shareholders in U.S stocks compared to the returns from U.S treasury bills however this growth and wealth has been disproportionately generated by a small number of companies of a sample of more than 25 000 companies fewer than a hundred have created half of this wealth this data only tells us so much though in our conversation with Professor bessembender we've supported further research into understanding with what features of companies are represented in the long-term winners the presser looked at 22 Key fundamental metrics in his analysis and reviewed more than 26 000 10-year outcomes for U.S stocks going back to 1950.""]"

began with an article from CNN claiming that Chachi BT could pick stocks better than your fund manager and since it been rather disappointed with Jim Cramer's track record I thought it would be worth the read as the article explained between March 6 and April 28th a dummy portfolio of 38 stocks gained 4.9 percent while 10 leading investment funds clocked an average loss of 0.8 percent now don't get the wrong idea it's not like you could just ask chat gbt"", ""but how exactly does this selection process work well this entire concept is based on a research paper that successfully used chat gbt to analyze which headlines were positive negative or neutral for stock prices their chat EBT recorded which headlines yielded the largest movements after being published Based On A String of keywords and what it found was that it was actually pretty good at predicting which stock prices were going to fall the most basically this chat gbt program found that negative articles yielded the largest immediate downward move in prices and when you concentrated that among smaller stocks you had the most upside if you shorted them or basically vetted against them now before you think that chat gbt

or negative relaying that against movements in the past and then making its best guess as to what might happen in the future for instance just recently chat gbt recommended Uber over Lyft based on the sentiment of recent news articles and even though basing your entire investment philosophy often news is well stupid you do have to admit it's pretty intriguing of course by now you're probably thinking to yourself but Grant how do they analyze real-time information when chat GPT isn't able to do that"", ""so if you have that that is the true cost to allow this thing to exist in your life

you do and ask yourself twice before you pay for this because maybe you should let me lose the money first but Andre chat GPT isn't even connected to the internet it's not going to be useful and those are good concerns but from what I understand of this experiment they're going to be feeding it articles manually from the internet as well as connecting apis from the news organizations and training it and keeping it up to date with macroeconomic information like interest rates the housing market the GDP unemployment things like that just to make sure that it has all of the context and it's aware of it now they're also going to be focusing on companies with 300 million dollars in market cap or bigger now each of their stocks will also need to be fed multiple articles about it almost every single day and if this was done manually this would be a massive undertaking that would almost be impossible unless they had a huge team behind them but from my understanding most of the information that they'll be collecting will be done automatically behind the scenes by collecting those apis that will gather and farm those headlines from the news articles Now using this methodology they're going to create a scoring system that will try to find the top 20 stocks with the best Market sentiment aka the stocks that people feel the most excited about in the future and they'll be buying them roughly every three days now they'll also try to leverage negative sentiment and they'll try to invest in those inverse ETFs kind of like the way the Jim Cramer ETF works so that is the methodology and it starts today now I have no clue how this will perform but that's also why I didn't invest fifty thousand dollars it could do incredibly well or it could do really bad or be somewhere in the

ways to go what we need to do right now rather than fomoing in is we need to start focusing in on the projects that are really making a difference so much of the noise that was here in the bull market that makes it so difficult to know which opportunities not only to participate in become a part of or invest in it's so difficult during bull markets because there's so much of that noise but on the other end of the spectrum during a bear Market we start to have a clean pallet a clean slate if you will for the crypto industry as The Silver Gates the ftx's all these companies start to cool down the Investments they're doing start to go down we start to really see which projects raised enough and on top of that have the team and the willpower hour to go out there and build something really exciting and that's why I want to spend some time to talk about one of our new long-term partner sponsors here on the channel and that is no other than Creek Stevia now some of you probably remember that I mentioned crixavia on the channel before I talked about quixevia over almost nearly a year ago when we did our last kind of altcoin focused video or top three altcoins to watch I think back in the month of March or April of last year cevia is one of the few play to earn metaverse MMORPG games utilizing nfts that has actually not only continued to build whereas the vast majority have gone and gone completely silent but on top of that they've not only had an alpha running for the past few months they're planning to launch their long-awaited beta that is going to come with a whole range of new worlds and features now just to give you guys some context if you have played games like World of Warcraft RuneScape like myself then you will love playing Chris Evia it is one of the few games that I actually am interested in and to put some skin to it I want to let you guys know that it's one of the few projects that I'm still holding right now you guys know we've pretty much gone to cash in the crypto Market sevia is one of the few positions I bought"", ""but I think there's a lot of opportunities and a couple of narratives that a we have exploited been able to capitalize on crypto gaming Etc but let's talk about the metaverse narrative I'll go over one that I think tremendous value mid cap I would say almost a low cap that has TR absolute top quality that I think has a lot of upside potential when this metaverse narrative with the sandbox in Saudi Arabia continues to play out with this pullback where are the opportunities let's dive into it like the video subscribe to the uh Channel down below here on crypto banter here every single day uh for daily shows updating you on every aspect of the market and shout out to our top tier sponsors here on in the game Anna mocha Brands the top web 3 gaming company are the biggest web3 gaming company in the space immutable uh immutable X the honestly the platform onboard onboarding the most games into this space in all of web 3 by bit one of the leading exchanges in crypto as well as nordvpn always be secure when you're navigating through crypto so guys check the link in the description down below for more on all of our sponsors let's go ahead and dive into the watch list quickly and kind of see what tokens have been performing right we've been seeing the AI narrative play out we talked about cytus AKA Senate yesterday it's up 25 over the 24 hour period veracity continues to rally and veracity just hit one cent again so they just shaved a zero for the time being which is a very very good sign because veracity obviously the quality of their project hasn't stopped but they definitely took a beating during the bear good to see them now back at one cent up 20 over the 24 hour and 55 over the last seven days we have wasner up 20 magic still up 20 and alluvium up 20 over the week but let's go ahead and dive into the narratives that I think along with a couple other people on the channel that I I still see a lot of opportunity in playing out where we can see in metaverse and in AI potentially and obviously in crypto gaming but what part of crypto gaming hasn't gotten attention yet where are the opportunities we'll dive into it in this Edition so we saw yesterday that Saudi Arabia and the sandbox agree to collaborate on metaverse projects now the sandbox and Saudi Arabia aside a mirandum of understanding but without revealing details explaining the scope of the agreement they have shown significant interest in the past in crypto and web3 and obviously them choosing sandbox is very powerful what does this mean for the metaverse right we saw an immediate pump we're looking at the uh chart here for sandbox yesterday we saw an immediate pump from this news"", ""[\xa0__\xa0] starting to come out in the gaming space for example eluvium just released the beta for their game with 30 000 test players ready to take the plunge it looks beautiful genso Kishi just released their game at the end of November so it's finally happening collectible card game cross the ages has opened up for Early Access people are already checking it out playing it then we have a exciting looking games like Off the Grid coming up at some point in the future which has like District 9 director Neil blomkamp on board like there's some seriously cool stuff going on in the gaming space in crypto and again those companies are portfolio companies you can check that out in the description for disclosures but my guess is that we see gaming being a leading force in crypto in 2023 and Beyond which is why I remain pretty invested in the sector now let's talk about monkey pictures I know the nfts had a really crazy crazy time in 2020 two in 2021 and we had a lot of scammy crap coming out but basically that was like wave one for nfts and while Legacy collections like board apes and crypto punks probably gonna be sticking around for a long gosh darn time the truth is that we have barely scratched the surface of nft Technology it's not just about monkey profile pictures man or flipping the next mint to make a few bucks nfts or digital ownership digital art and all kinds of use cases can grow out of that there is a reason why every Big Brand is getting into nfts right now because they're the evolution of ownership online I think 2023 this is a whole new wave of nft innovation happening a whole new wave of nft creators and collectors coming in that doesn't necessarily mean prices are going to go super nuts especially in Legacy collections but we could see some pretty cool stuff happening in the Ft space so do keep paying attention and we could see of course some cool collections come up that might be worth grabbing now before telling you about the recession regulations and of course whether or not we are going to actually see a new high in 2023 or not I just want to let you know about my weekly crypto investor newsletter it's called wealth mastering it is just

talk about the potential for recession basically everyone and their mom is calling for a recession right now and they're all saying that it's going to be super super bad man like really bad like so bad seriously bad probably not good one thing is abundantly transparent though be ready for Market turmoil in 2023 maybe we're lucky maybe the [\xa0__\xa0] doesn't hit the fan""]"

and for sponsoring this video crypto has been out for quite some time his kit and playstyle has evolved meaning the possibilities are endless when it comes to mastering this Legend in which even the algorithm cannot predict join myself and the other crypto Mains as we find out what it truly means to be off the grid new in season 16 his Recon class perk allows him to scan the survey beacons to find enemies throughout the map similar to his map room but be careful and time your scans as you want to know the last location of nearby enemies before pushing them and each scan can be used once per POI that contains the beacon when in drone view an important tip is to check the banners around the map to find the amount of squads in the area the range is calculated from crypto and has a radius of 200 meters which is roughly the size of your mini-map you can use this information to determine how to approach fights and once you've finished check for nearby third parties that may have heard you as you're initiating a fight you'd want to throw your drone at a 35 degree angle this ensures that you utilize the Drone scan radius of 30 meters and its detection radius of 240 degrees tap your Tactical to send your drone 23 meters forward in theory this creates a distance of visibility to anticipate enemies like bloodhounders and just like a mirage decoy it gives enemies a split second decision whether to shoot the Drone which allows you to push and deal the initial damage or let them prepare for the push as they are continuously scanned with a cooldown of 40 seconds is important to keep your drone healthy you can do so by recalling your drone when you see its Health while going down enemies and their traps doors Supply bins and loot ticks are all highlighted by the Drone in addition to this you can pick up Fallen teammates banners and instantly revive them the ultimate can be activated in or out of the Drone you should push after an EMP as enemies are stunned for a few seconds running away or healing leaving them vulnerable and EMP without an aggressive push is essentially a waste of an ultimate can stun and deal 50 damage to yourself and enemies and slow everyone caught in the area of effect the damage also Stacks up your EvoShield giving you free damage EMP also directly affects 14 out of the 23 Legends such as gibraltar's bubble or stick traps while some fences and pylon catalysts ferrofluid and more your Tactical the surveillance drone is the jack of all trades master of none it could provide so much Intel to your game and more holding your Tactical button will launch the Drone by 4 meters which you would then be able to enter drone view throw it on the floor or by cover as you want to prevent your drone from being shot down which is a very important tip to note as I see a few crypto players throwing it in the air thinking it's the only way to go you can also protect yourself by using those few seconds of going into drone by sliding into cover to add to this utilize the buildings and environments for cover this improves your scan and EMP potential and reduces the chance of the Drone being destroyed information such as minimap ring timer how many squads left kills and damage Lobby kill feed health bar and shield and ALT percentage are displayed in your drone user interface you are able to Ping within your drone or use your will to provide information to your teammates this is very beneficial if you do not use voice chat when in drone view you can open doors Supply bins and care packages you can also open vaults if you have the vault key in your inventory if you've used up ammo in the mag going into drone view reload your weapons for you"", ""but it takes the same time as it would if you did it manually this is great for providing quick Intel by going into your drone first when the team is pushing and once you get out of drone view you'll be able to shoot your weapons you can recall your drone back or you can go out the drones 240 meter range which will automatically come back to you be careful not to recall the Drone when you're Reviving teammates or using charge towers as it interrupts the process you may notice a green circle on your reticle within 17 meters the reticle will highlight bright green meaning that when you deploy the Drone it will rotate itself facing away from the wall this is great for covering blind spots or creating a cctv-like scenario which the Drone will watch certain angles in addition to the benefits you can create a distraction by placing the drone on the wall giving you free scans and creating pressure on the enemy team you can place the Drone in bushes and trees although some trees May block Vision or pathway stopping you from going through them like in broken moon it's a great way to have free scans and also makes the Drone harder to be seen and shot down you can also place the Drone to see through Windows to scan enemies although some windows block the scan think of the Drone as your fourth reliable teammate watching your back and notifying you when needed if your drone detects enemies or is destroyed you can make the call to disengage rotate elsewhere or look to fight the oncoming team a technique to distract enemies for a split second would be to fly your drone high in the air but still be able to utilize its 30 meter scan radius to force them to look into the sky to destroy a small pixelated drone this will allow you to push up freely giving you first Contact of the fight you can also use this distraction created from the gun noise to attract nearby enemies you can leave your drone outside the ring to scan for unsuspecting teams as the Drone sound is masked by the ring audio and the orange aura Blends in with the ring this tip is more useful in ranked but use your drone to scout for unoccupied spaces for your team to push too this can give you the advantage for being in a good spot for zone or for pinching teams when looking to climb up the ranks bring your drone Up When approaching fights to earn free assists however do not stay in drone for too long and grieve your teammates a balance of drone usage and fighting abilities are needed to rank up properly look for unopened bins and open them in drone to earn five crafting materials giving you the ability to craft what you need instead of having to run around the area one of the most dangerous ultimates in the game the EMP deals a hundred to active corsic traps and destroys and active barrels 100 to octane's jump pad and removes the amp section of rampart's walls and disables stationary Sheila for around 20 seconds it also deals 100 damage to both parts of newcastle's mobile Shields and permanently disables the electricity on his Ultima it also cancels valcol if she has Shield EMP also destroys lober's Black Market Sears exhibit Mirage decoys and lifeline's healing drone coordinating emps with your teammates that use a movement Legend ability such as octane's pad Horizon Q Rave portal or Pathfinder Zips can catch enemies off guard as they are healing or running away making escapes impossible with discount Nation try to exit your drone a few seconds before your EMP detonates that gives you those crucial moments to catch enemies awaiting their Doom the Reliance on having to pick up Fallen teammate banners with your drone aren't as important anymore since support players are able to craft their banners back but still remember your drone's 200 meter range to take your time and create a safe distance between your enemies to pick up the banners you can also help create that safe distance by EMP enemies as you grab the banner lowering their sensitivity making it hard for them to track and shoot the Drone as crypto has lost the ability to scan the next ring you can somewhat determine the next Zone by looking at the enemies that are crowded together this also means you might be able to third party if you're fast enough or look for fights that are more isolated from everyone else stopping you from being third-partied as well unfortunately crypto has no moving abilities is important to learn movement techniques and memorize building layouts to Advantage for quick and easy escapes carry at least one Autumn accelerant which removes roughly A Min net of your cooldown this prepares for unexpected fights in which you don't have your ultimate already and you can use one after the fight to prepare for the next one it is also very useful to craft or carry a Mobile Beacon you can rest teammates in the safe spot instantly especially if your support Legend teammates craft the banner back some cryptos have a tendency of hitting themselves with their EMP so it's useful to wear gold armor to heal yourself quickly if there are any enemies in the vicinity you may need to self EMP if you've taken any short damage self EMP remotely and immediately pop any Shield or use armor swaps in death boxes or floor loot to pounce on your enemies quicker there's always much to learn when playing as crypto but the important tip you can take away from this video is to not stay in your drone for long periods of time the only excuse would be if

In the past, I had a client that was working with this broker. They were out of New York. They sold him a mutual fund, which the advisor got paid an upfront commission, and then within six to nine months, they resold them another mutual fund that was a different share class. But the reason they did that was because the client didn't see the upfront cost. There wasn't a backend surrender charge on the investment that they sold them. So they got paid an upfront commission, had the client sell where their client didn't see anything coming out on the backend, and then resold them, basically, the exact same thing, getting paid an upfront commission, and the client not seeing that. That's what you call churn. Now churn is basically when an advisor is just buying and selling, not to your benefit, but just to make extra commissions, to get paid more money. And I promise you that is not in your best interest."", ""Now, the advisor, they got paid a big, fat, upfront commission for that sale, so why would they want to volunteer that information that hey, Mr. and Mrs. Client, I'm gonna get paid a lot of money, but if you need your money back, you're actually gonna have to pay a large surrender to get your money back. So I'm just not gonna share that with you. You know, it's okay, all right. Peace, I'm out. Advisor number three is the telling the truth is optional advisor. So this advisor just doesn't feel the need to tell the truth. They may not tell the truth about the surrender charge. They might not tell the truth of how much you are paying in your fees to work with them. They just don't feel the need to tell the truth about anything, and it just doesn't really make sense to me. Now, typically, these type of advisors, you're gonna find them on FINRA BrokerCheck. There is going to be a complaint filed against them."", "" This is Jeff Rose with Good Financial Cents. Today I want to talk about the difference between a fee-only financial advisor versus a fee-based financial advisor. What is the difference? A fee-only financial advisor is directly compensated from the client and only compensated from the client. That means they don’t get paid a commission from an investment product, they don't earn any trails from their brokerage firm or mutual fund company, and they don’t get paid a referral fee. The only way they get paid is directly from the client and working with that relationship. Typically the fee-only financial planner or financial advisor can get paid hourly, a fee for service or a retainer fee. Another common method is assets under management. I talk more about the fee-only financial advisor in another video so if you want more information, be sure to check it out. A fee-based financial planner is a little trickier. They have the option of earning a fee and also earning a commission. Trying to figure out what relationship or what role they are working with you makes it a little bit harder for you to distinguish.""]"

price target based on earnings and new information if it changes the data and the numbers of your estimates if it's justified you have to be willing to change the price target now that doesn't mean change the price target based on where the stock is trading if the stock went up three four hundred percent because ooh all the hedge funds are buying it because they're exploiting those up trends well that doesn't mean that the stock is worth a lot more it means that you got lucky and it factored in your price target a lot faster than it should have and similarly if the stock gets beat down massively because ooh hedge funds are shorting it or ooh interest rates or whatever then that doesn't mean that the company's worth less because all of a sudden the market wants to short and distort it upgrades or downgrades on your price target have to be based on what the company is actually doing or at least the industry if it doesn't affect the revenue projections or the earnings projections of your company then it should not affect the price target just because joe blow said you're going to be a bag holder and you're an idiot if you hold the stock because now it's down well that is not a good enough reason to downgrade a price target if you're uncertain in your price target because it's down that's fine go ahead and go back to the data but if the data still justifies the higher price target you have to be true to your analysis a price target gives you a bearing on what something is worth regardless of fud or favor so you can't use what's happening in the emotions of the market to judge the company's value or else the price target is useless it's also a good rule of thumb that if you have to update a price target more than twice a quarter you probably don't have a good enough grasp on the company i struggle with this everybody does if you're uncertain of what the price target is i found it's just better to get rid of the price target and just drop the conviction play if

of its previous run if it can do that I believe it'll be relevant for Rebound opportunities next hlbz so hlbz followed genus's lead and decided to investigate their own naked Short Selling we briefed on them at about 18 cents and it ran to just under 37 cents the company had shown proof of concept in the pre-market momentum wise and had announced a discontinuation of operations and unprofitable markets on top of that like I just mentioned they followed gns's lead in investigating short sellers which is going to drive a lot more interest into the stock moving forward which I believe is going to show very very clearly in the coming week or two that said from a trading perspective if you're looking at this for Rebound opportunities moving forward you want to make sure that you see actual proof of concept again usually that comes in the pre-market what is proof of concept it's actually being able to run solidly above an SMA line or a certain percentage gain in a short period of time proof of concept is exactly what it says it is showing that it can run before you blindly guess that it can run if subbing is diving 20 a minute well obviously that's not showing proof of concept right that's a falling knife if something has slowed down and and all of a sudden it's starting to pick up again and going up a little bit showing a bit of confirmation over an SMA line then all of a sudden at least you have some proof of concept right and people say oh proof of concept it's not a guarantee that it's going to continue running obviously not but at least at least you're filtering out the ones that can't even have enough strength to go up a slight smidgen you are free to buy in something when it's dumping like a dog but don't complain afterwards that it's continued dumping next

identify abusive Short Selling which of course set the stage for them to benefit from momentum Traders looking to buy short fighting stocks and we briefed on cosm at 348-ish on Friday morning and it ran to 642 at highs and this folks is the power of doing your homework and showing up every day for folks that say oh Charlie you know there's no value in doing your homework and following Trends and looking for patterns because patterns don't 100 repeat them ourselves well this is what I have to show you if you can acknowledge what the market is thinking and then look at what the market has done in the past in terms of rallying up similar stocks well you can start getting yourselves on the front lines when certain catalysts drop and they start causing stocks to run do little rally rally does and that's exactly how we find all these briefing plays and building off that if you are looking for more trade ideas heading into this coming week here is a cheat sheet here are the three major types of stocks and criteria that you need to be looking for number one stocks that announce or have announced Short Selling investigations which I believe a lot more announcements are coming because it's an obvious win for companies that do it their stock goes up right after they can explain away their bad stock performance to their shareholders saying it's all the short seller's fault and so everybody's happy so it's a win-win if stocks start investigating their short sellers right number two small caps that consistently hold momentum in the pre-market a lot of Runners stem in the pre-market and then add on after open number three you want to look for any sort of FDA approval or other regulatory biotech Catalyst like positive phase trials those will will have extra Firepower in

notable investors who've recently taken a large position in Baba now I'm taking the risk of going long into earnings Baba has had some challenges but one of the bullish Dynamics surrounding the stock right now is the stimulus money that China is pumping into the economy so China has shifted from stimulating the economy through infrastructure spending which is what they've mostly been known for to consumption spending for the very first time this is new and it's going to position Chinese stocks and cryptos to potentially lead the true bull market which I believe is still ahead of us all of the

remember the markets seemed Unstoppable the Bulls were breaking down trampling the Bears that was the day when Tesla was breaking above the 208 and so it wasn't easy to go against the direction or the

this morning I took profits at 39 thousands of dollars of profit made on the sqq today now I gave that 39 Target in a previous video so you guys knew where I was eyeing if you've been understanding my game plan you understand that even though these markets have been in a micro bullish Trend I expected them to back test four thousand and if the trend is going to continue to the upside we should see a pop from that 4000 level and that's the perfect spot to take profits on the bearish sq's Hedge now I know that from the chat there are a few of you guys out there that played the cues without a stop

I'm going to be doing a live on Larry's page with Keenan Grayson stockmo don't miss that I think it's going to be absolute fire now I want this video to be super clear all this talk of us being in a micro bullish Trend could be confusing now I will not believe that the markets are in a macro bullish Trend until we break above and close above that previous high that was established in the mid-august of 2022 of 43.25 until that happens all the bullishness that we have seen in the last three months is just a long bear Market rally a lot of stocks have moved back to the top of their trade range and if we break back below that 39.50 which we're very close to today and we don't make a new high or low these markets could easily give back the 20 pump up from the October low and if you got back into big Tech or Communication Service sectors the ones that have been pumping where stocks are up a hundred percent or more from their lows Tesla for example up 100 meta up over 120 percent if you got back into these and you don't intend to play with a stop loss your Investments could be positioned right now for a 50 loss in the next 45 days if we break that 39.50 if we break that higher low position then statistically the likeliness of us getting a lower low has become very high now this doesn't mean that every stock is going to get back to its June or its October lows if you didn't buy your favorite stocks at those key moments you may never see those prices again that is why I repeatedly said that you have to be prepared to buy on days that nobody wants to buy now I've provided

Generally, Brett, fantastic that you're getting invested. Don't feel like you have to go invest in IPOs. You might not even be able to because of some of the eligibility requirements.

He pointed me to a few resources that I want to share with Brett. The first one is clickipo.com. Mobile-first, friendly application that helps regular individual investors not just learn about IPOs and businesses that are setting up for an initial public offering, but actually invest in them because their online app ties directly into many brokerage accounts.

away from the money you may struggle with liquidity this is just a factor of it still being a relatively new market now if any of that was unclear to you don't worry we have a complete review of the ribbit that I've linked to below let's switch gears now as I want to talk about the broader potential for crypto options one of the biggest markets for crypto options has to be from institutional investors and miners the letter to finance operations and the former to protect or enhance crypto portfolios previously large option contracts used to only be traded over-the-counter or through swap dealers dealers such as ledger X structured bespoke option deals that saw some hedge fund traders make millions like the example of this guy who bought Bitcoin options for 1 million dollars in December of 2017 these options had a strike price of $50,000 and an expiry date at the end of 2018 the bet didn't work out too well for him but at least he didn't put his on the line like John McAfee anyways the problem with these OTC option contracts is that sometimes the dealer can't find a counterpart to their trade the OTC market is chunky and idiosyncratic this is where Exchange listed option contracts have an advantage these markets are more liquid as the contracts are standardized hence it's a lot easier for institutions to structure trades Bitcoin options are now being offered in listed form on a few exchanges in December of last year trading began on quarterly Bitcoin options are backed for those who don't know backed was the first regulated futures exchange to offer physically settled Bitcoin futures not one to be left behind in January of 2020 the CME announced the launch of their own listed Bitcoin options contracts there was a lot of anticipation for the launch of these options as open interest in the CM e futures markets spiked just before the rollout on the first day of live trading volume on the CME exchange exceeded all the volume that was traded on backs since its launch last year what's driving the demand"", ""well I think that options are less of a speculative instrument than futures are they're a great way to hedge risk in an inherently volatile markets such as bitcoins by reducing risk it could temper volatility there is strong evidence that the introduction of option instruments to the FX markets have a calming effect and brought down the wild swings that it used to have in the past as we know one of the primary arguments made against Bitcoin is that it's too volatile to be used as a medium of exchange if more stability is brought to the market could we see more adoption of Bitcoin or crypto from the reduced volatility food-for-thought I'm also hoping to see more retail exchanges offering crypto options which can be used by most of us although they're slightly more complicated than futures they give us a more sophisticated and less risky way to trade the markets they're also more of a risk management tool than a form of speculation if we take a look around crypto trading circles these days it appears to mostly be centered around multiplying an investment rather than preserving a portfolio another thing that we're likely to see pretty soon is decentralized options built with smart contract technology already there are a number of projects that are building blockchain based solutions for derivative instruments so in other words we could one day see decentralized option exchanges think 0x or khyber but for bespoke option contracts you heard it here first defy option contracts built on the blockchain and traded on chain immutable transparent and in your hands we've been through a lot so congrats if you're still with me I'm going to wrap this up now with a few of my final thoughts I'm really quite excited about the opportunity presented by Bitcoin options firstly it's going to further credential eyes Bitcoin markets in the eyes of the institutions with a regulated and liquid options market these big funds are more likely to dip their toes in it could also provide an important risk management tool not only for these funds but also for those businesses that rely on Bitcoin miners could write contracts to hedge Bitcoin risk for future mined bitcoins by providing certainty of cash flows it could encourage more capital investment today as these options bring more certainty and security to the Bitcoin markets it could quell some of that intense volatility a more stable Bitcoin is a better outcome for all no longer will you have to hear the argument the Bitcoin is too volatile as a currency moreover if Bitcoin options turn out to be a success then it could open up the possibilities of numerous other cryptocurrency options bull spread on stellar anyone how about a strangle on Tron and as mentioned earlier there are a whole host of more exotic option types that exist in the financial markets if vanilla options on Bitcoin turn out to be a success if we could see more exotic variants eventually being launched could we see American options how about the Asian kind or maybe the digital variant barrier options any one basket options this ain't all mumbo jumbo these are advanced options with unique payoff parameters they're regularly priced in traditional financial markets and they provide their own unique benefits indeed there may be an OTC broker right now that's already facilitating deals of more exotic cryptocurrency options if there's one thing that we've learned it's that dealers will line up to provide markets as long as there is demand either way I'm really excited about the future of the Bitcoin market liquidity is increasing and efficiency is on the rise volatility is decreasing and ignorance is on the decline and that my fellow crypto traders is my video on Bitcoin

That indicates that the market thinks this deal is likely to go through. Now, you can sit there and wait to see if maybe there\'s a better offer. Perhaps another company might come in and say, ""You know what? We like Medtronic\'s offer, but we\'re going to raise it. We\'re going to pay $65 a share for Mazor Robotics."" That\'s always a possibility. Now, the market is telling us probably not going to happen, and I think in Mazor\'s case, they\'d like to be a part of the Medtronic family, anyway; so, it is a little bit of a gamble, there, if you decide to go ahead and sell your shares and move on.', ' Alison Southwick: The next question comes from Vince. ""Can anyone at TMF explain what happens when a company you own sells to another company, as in what happens to the stock? I own Mazor Robotics, which recently sold to Medtronic. Do my Mazor shares automatically convert to Medtronic or automatically cash out once the sale is complete? Do I have to do anything like sign an agreement for my shares or sell the shares to Medtronic? Or do nothing and it magically takes care of itself in the mysterious trading world?"" Jason Moser: The short answer is yes. Southwick: Oh, great! Moser: Yes. It\'s an interesting situation because there are a lot of different ways this can be resolved for you. We\'ll use Mazor Robotics as the example because that was the example that was given, but there was a recent deal where Medtronic has agreed to acquire Mazor Robotics and this is an all-cash deal. So Medtronic is going to pay all cash for this. The deal has already been approved and it is expected to close during Medtronic\'s third quarter ending January 25th, 2019.']"

before seen musk's simple tweet triggered the nft floor price to see a 59 percent boost over the past seven days pushing it to hit an all-time high 4 price of 7.3 ethereum worth 13 700 before it slowly fell back to 5.6 ethereum worth 10 509 a few hours later moreover musk's tweet boosted Milady sales increasing it by a factor of 500 percent over the previous 24 hours milady's recent performance also allowed it to climb to the top trending nft spot in the popular non-fungible token Marketplace Open Sea but the Tweet didn't only affect the nft collection's price it also massively

is in no way affiliated or associated with Milady the nft project please do your own research before proceeding but just because it isn't officially affiliated with the nft project doesn't mean it won't continue to go up in price whenever Elon tweets about Dogecoin it also makes sheaves price go up even though the projects aren't affiliated and the really interesting thing about this project is that according to Cone Gekko the project was made on May 9th exactly 36 hours before Elon musk's tweet this almost seems too convenient but of course this is just speculation"", ""Shiba Inu good luck

that 20 week moving average we got an hour 52 minutes left as I do this video to see can cardano close and it's great to see this this candle getting back above the 20-week moving average everybody we've been waiting for this because we've been all year tracking the resistance at that area and if I just zoom out this has been the story of the bear Market that 20-week moving average we're seeing the Bulls stepping in this is the convergence of the 50-day moving out or the 50-week moving average a 20-week moving average the Bulls stepping in to shift this ship around that's what's happening this is the picture of it that's what we've been waiting for so there's a lot of patience here this is a weekly this is multi-month view right just in this very just sideways type of trading environment but this is the type of stuff we look for the 20-week moving average being below Ada price and so right now we'll be I'll be watching this in the short term over the next couple of hours just to see if Ada closes below and then in the upcoming week can we get the separation away from it that is always the key and in that Journey we have the 50-week moving average right around just below 40 cents so now let's dig into Ada on the short term because this is what I'm watching for couple things one thing for long-term context we still have this falling wedge that we've been tracking for quite a long time now breaking out of the upside just coming back down and just eight is just consolidating in its own way in its own roller coaster type of way since then but the target Remains the Same to the upside 70 cents what I find interesting right now happening on the short term charts for Ada and I'm not saying 70 cents is coming quick"", ""we're also seeing a higher low form compared to what we saw in late september which could indicate that we're seeing an uptrend form there on top of all of that if we look at lux algo right here we can see that we are actually pretty close to the support zone on lux algo premium and we've also had a take profit signal for all of you guys that have been shorting ever since this sell signal came into play remember you can use coupon code jeb jebb to get 20 off at checkout for lux algo if you are interested but there are a few other reasons why i think that the bottom might be in one of them has to do with our moving averages and if we go ahead and take a look here at a couple of very important moving averages especially the 200 daily exponential you can see that bitcoin excuse me cardano has bounced bullish off of this and looks to be moving to the upside now even looking down here on the 12 hourly chart we can see that cardano has put into play a bullish engulfing candlestick formation right here and down here on the macd we have been reversing bullish and are moving to the upside which is a very good signal on top of all of that we can look at the rsi here and see rsi push down to 29 indicating that we became oversold for a time also if we take a look here at our volume we can see that while the volume isn't that high we have had a little bit of a blip in volume and with the rest of the cryptocurrency market trying to put support under it and trying to continue rallying especially ethereum right now there's a very strong likelihood that bitcoin and ethereum and cardano are all going to go into uptrends and the final thing i'll say on this point is that cardano has established a strong zone of support right here around a dollar to a dollar and 50 cents and over the last couple of weeks cardano has been establishing a strong zone of support between a dollar and 80 cents and 2.45 cents i think that similarly to how we saw a couple of big rallies break out of our previous zone of support we're going to see something similar happen here and cardano is going to go on a big rally so here's what i think is going to happen i think that cardano is going to rally all the way to 2.45 cents where am i getting that from that is a local level of resistance that was set on the 25th of september i think we're going to push all the way up there in the next seven to 14 days then i think in the next month sometime before the end of november we're going to be pushing 2.80 cents which is a local level that we set back around september the 11th"", ""but two things number one we have the Fibonacci from the swing low back here which is very critical at this time and it's been critical for like probably weeks now since May 8th or so swing low to swing High we have just this higher low Fibonacci and you can see Bitcoin trending just at that 618 line right here that that's a support area it's a just higher low support error you can you can see the channel goes down to the 786 right around 33 cents a 10 drop for cardano is still very much in play if cardano needs to consolidate further to the downside I'd be watching that 786 around 33 cents as a support area now it's kind of just between though that support area right here and this the 20-day moving average which recently just crossed below the 50-day moving average so you can just see it's getting squeezed in between these two areas and it's very interesting to see which direction is it going to break there are some concerns I think in terms of really just general sentiment in markets not just crypto even if markets are going to continue to the downside it's a pretty clear scenario for for cardano to fall to the downside and I want to show you actually and illustrate a picture of what that looks like then we can talk about upside but if we go over here to this six hour chart I kind of highlighted this area back here we spot very similar structures and just setups all the time in crypto and they become very helpful in times like this when we're when we're analyzing certain areas we were looking for a support area and this we can call it our confirmation area meaning if cardano succeeds in having support here we could get a very explosive move and that would be because it diverges from what is very much in play and the picture is setting up we take our barge pattern and what I'm going to be highlighting is this move back here this consolidation move back here before this big fall and this was this was a capitulation bear Market low type of fall remember this is a very big fall not saying the fall would be this big but this is the setup let's get our barge pattern and you can see this consolidation that's that's happening back here is looking extremely similar to what's happening right

four major reasons taxes volatility fees but most importantly i think is the fact that fiat already works now let me tell you how great the banks are like for strictly commerce fiat is actually pretty efficient there just isn't a big push right now to replace it with something slightly less convenient not not in quote-unquote civilized society at least it's clear that the market values a store of

like sugar okay sugar used to be very scarce not scarce anymore there's a ton of sugar and it's basically like a penny for a pound it's no value to it well fiat currencies mean the fed itself has said they have infinite money that means there's no scarcity in it whatsoever that means there's no value in it bitcoin however 21 million bitcoin 6 million have already been lost that means there's 15 million bitcoin there's over 30 million millionaires in the world so even if every millionaire wanted to own a bitcoin and look at how popular they're becoming with institutions every millionaire couldn't every millionaire could only own half of the bitcoin you know if every person on the earth if bitcoin the 21 million bitcoin were divided upon every person on earth everybody would only get point zero zero two bitcoin so scarcest asset asset ever that's why you need to take a look at all coins compared to bitcoin because here's the thing bitcoin is going up check the scoreboard it just goes up and up and up and the problem is the human brain can't understand the exponential function in case you guys haven't yet make sure to like subscribe also click the notification bell but the brain can't understand the exponential function warren buffett and einstein have both said that the best thing ever created is compound interest well basically the inverse of compound interest is the exponential function and bitcoin every time there's a halfing it follows along the exponential function that's why we have the stock to flow model that's why we have the bitcoin rainbow chart every halfing the value of bitcoin goes up a whole another order of magnitude it was ten thousand last time it's a hundred thousand this time it'll be a millionth time after that 10 million after that now this isn't completely because of scarcity it's also because they're printing a ton of money this past year the us printed more money than has been created in a quarter of the existence of the united states so they printed 25 of the money that's ever been created in one year and they have another plan to do another two trillion dollar stimulus package coming up soon so fiat money is has no value

thanksgiving hi happy thanksgiving really quickly let me give you a definition bitcoin is the first digital verifiably scarce asset in human history what does that mean well i'm gonna break it down really simply for you first and foremost let's talk about the word digital bitcoin being digital means that it exists online it means that it is able to take advantage of all of the amazing things that the internet provides for example you're able to send payments with bitcoin all over the world nearly instantaneously with just a little bit of waiting for the transaction to clear you don't have to worry about things like banks giving you permission to send a transaction it gives it a property called permissionless and you get to reap all of those rewards of the internet now the next part digital verifiably what does verifiably mean well verifiably refers to the blockchain of bitcoin what is that it's a complicated topic i'm trying to keep this video short but basically it is something called a consensus algorithm that uh allows you to be sure that bitcoin has not been hacked been it allows you to be sure that your transaction is actually happening and is not being spent twice in something called a double spend attack it being verifiable means that bitcoin is perfectly secure it is unhackable and in fact bitcoin is the first unhackable or next to unhackable network in the entire world you would need literally hundreds of billions of dollars worth of hardware and equipment to be able to hack bitcoin that's just not realistic so it is digital meaning that it's global on the internet verifiable means that you are able to verify the third component the third component which is called scarce bitcoin has something called scarcity bitcoin will only ever have 21 million bitcoin created so far there's about 18.8 maybe about 18.9 bitcoin a million bitcoin that have been created there will only ever be 21 million which means that it is scarce the reason that's so valuable is because your us dollar has already lost a large amount of its value over just the last 18 months during the thing that i'm not allowed to say on youtube""]"

i will have a can of sardines to eat so i'll just open it and eat it well the market did crash and he opened the can to find out that the sardines were rotten so he probably went to the trader who had sold him that bad can of sardines and said these sardines are no good to obviously which the second trader responded of course they're no good for eating they are trading sardines so you might have heard this and how does it apply to bond markets so let's get into that now almost 10 trillion dollars worth of the world's government bonds when i wrote this were trading at negative yields now it's probably closer to 20 trillion and with the fed and other central banks pumping in a lot of money into the system it's possible that yields might go even further negative on a lot of the bond markets that are out there so these bond markets are trading like these sardines when a bond has negative yield like a majority of these bond markets in germany and japan do today the bonds are really being bought for trading not for holding his investments unless we somehow undertake some sort of financial alchemy to figuratively turn this garbage into gold or vice versa gold into garbage now when if yields rise a 10-year german wound that is trading close to negative 40 basis points when i wrote this paper negative 25 basis points nominal yield will almost certainly lose a good part of its principle and for those who hold it to maturity it will also provide absolutely no income for their investment because they're paying money to hold this bond in addition to parting with their principal they're also paying effectively a coupon to hold this bond so in other words unless the current holders of these bonds are able to trade them to someone else before they lose value they will likely find that these bonds were neither a good term investment nor a diversifier and not a provider of any sort of return so now let's turn to the financial financial alchemy that in the short run can potentially turn these negatively yielding bonds into positively yielding bonds so readers know that due to interest rate parity a currency with lower interest rates trades at a higher exchange rate in the future for instance if you look at the exchange rate versus the euro or the us dollar the implied forward exchange rate is very much tradable because you can change the forward exchange rate as a swap or just as a one shot forward is basically calculated based on the interest rate differential times the basis swap and it's about the writing of this paper was about three cents per euro higher than the spot exchange rate so the euro was trading at a premium to the us dollar because the euro interest rates were so much lower than the u.s interest rates and again the source for all this data is from the bloomberg taken at that time and then again recently the implied forward exchange rate for any pair of currencies is thus determined by the spot exchange rate the differential of the money market rates or whatever that tenor is and the cross-currency basis swap which essentially measures the supply and demand mismatch for the two currencies now for this discussion we'll just ignore the basis swap it's small and it's variable sometimes it can get large"", ""but then of course you have researchers and different economists claiming that we will see US economy experience a major crash by 2020 and something else we need to understand that everyone is acknowledging the issue but no one is really doing anything about it so many people have acknowledges the fact that US has a huge debt problem but what why is no one acting on it so the debt problem of the u.s. mentioned by Kim does come has been shared by both economists and government agencies like the International Monetary Fund which recently emphasized that the US has to stop ignoring the seriousness of its federal debt held by the public even if you think that public that just doesn't matter to economic outcomes the thing that you have to admit is that when we hit a downturn which might happen soon that is absolutely true if you read the Ray Dalio if you looked at Ray Dalio is famous video about how the economic machine works we are a juice for a downturn and everything is in cycles when it comes to economies when you have a credit based economy as we currently have in the Western world it always goes in cycles because as soon as you borrow money as soon as you take credit you automatically create a future where you will have to pay it back where you need to cut your expenses and when you cut your expenses you're not paying the people you used to pay and they need to cut their expenses and they're not paying people they used to pay and so everyone just comes back so cycles are just inevitable and at that time governments are less likely to take significant steps if the debt is as high as ours is now so quite interesting development and the team that come has really been fighting this situation and you know he's really on a mission to fight the US because he feels that they really you know messed him up if you read kim.com story you realize why he is so passionate towards you know replacing the US dollar and things like that because he really has had a lot of problems with the US government and just us authorities and so it's going to be interesting to follow this of course but you need to understand that the timeline is important here I mean who knows how long time it will take whether it's ten years twenty thirty fifty but definitely something to keep in mind and as long as we know that this is unsustainable as long as we can prepare ourselves I think we are in a good position so that is news number one number two we're going to discuss Sweden because Sweden may be the first country that completely switches to digital cash so this is quite interesting because in Sweden you have the situation that no one is really paying with cash no one wants to handle cash you know it's annoying you have like bills you have all these coins you need to handle people don't like that people are generally you know they like technology they are high-tech so they embrace all the new stuff all the new mobile payments all of the new you know touchless payments all of that so in that sense the Swedish people really embrace the new payments technology at the same time you realize that more and more of the economy is switching to private banks private banks controlling everything because if you're not a private bank customer you do not have a bank account you cannot buy anything currently you still can I mean currently there is still possibilities to spend cash but there are very very limited I mean practically you can say that you cannot spend spend cash because you know so many so many grocery stores nowadays so many coffee shops just say we don't accept cash we only accept cards and the central bank doesn't like that that is something to realize the central bank really doesn't like the development and many private banks are now refusing to take cash at all they're refusing to handle cash and so the central bank really sees this as a threat to the nation's economy threat to the nation's stability when everything is in the hands of a few private corporations namely a few private banks that basically dominate the swedish banking market and for several years Sweden has been developing this a crown system so you know this Swedish currency is called Karuna and this is equally a crooner like you know electronic Karuna and so now we have some updates on the situation they released a second report the central bank of Sweden Riggs Bank and and basically the outline that you know what in 2018 only 13% of of people that they surveyed paid in cash for the recent purchased and just eight years ago this number was 39% so only 13% paid in cash for their recent purchase and they also outlined that you know the mission of the central bank is to provide the general public with money and going forwards the technical development and decentralization of payments will bring the issue of the state's role to to a head basically they need to provide stability they need to provide a payments market that is functioning well and you realize that if they do not act so they write if you know not to act in the face of current developments and completely leave the payment market to private agents a few private banks we will ultimately leave the general public entirely dependent on a private payment solution you can find the link in the description for this and you realize also there is an issue that comes to state on the digital cash I mean a stent is state operated and state owned digital cash obviously cash has always been created by the state but now when you move it to the digital form it becomes kind of scary because what if the state doesn't like you like it's a simple question what if in the future you have some kind of dictatorship you never who will be ruling the country in the future and so I think you always need to ask yourself what will happen if suddenly you go to the wrong meeting you go to the wrong political party you go to the wrong protest and the state can basically freeze your account with your cash and so we've never seen this before we've never seen these kinds of development before at all and Sweden is a country that likes to experiment with money that is something we need to understand because Sweden was the first country to establish a central bank at all"", ""so the chart in the paper that's on forbes you can see the various combinations for the u.s euro and japanese 10-year maturity government bonds from the perspective of investors in all these different currencies and countries so even though every country in this list has a much lower unhedged yield than the us treasury and here i had a loan exception being italy which we'll also address in a second the hedge yields for every country's bond is higher than the yield of the u.s 10-year treasury this is an example of the carry trade at its finest and potentially at its most dangerous by taking a long-term low yielding asset and by using a derivative contract the low yield is now turned into a high yield temporarily and vice versa now the state of affairs where the u.s treasury's lower head shield than any other country is not completely an accident global central banks are easing policy pretty aggressively and as of this writing the u.s had not eased policy aggressively subsequently it has eased policy quite substantially like i commented on during that write-up and in the post-covet environment yields have indeed in the u.s been cut quite drastically now the lower policy rates in foreign countries result in carry benefits both in their internal market and also in the external market so let's get into that for a second for example in europe very negatively yielding short-term yields for example short-term meals went down to about i think negative 90 basis points result in positive carry even for a 10-year bond at negative 25 basis points for internal european buyers such as indexers or banks in europe this is because if they buy a bond at negative 0.25 then with a fixed yield curve shape the bond rolls down towards the more negative shorter term yield which results in a positive total return so even though the yield itself is negative the roll down and carry result in a positive expected return now the increasing target two deficits that's the balance of the central banks between the italian central bank and the german central bank and others are indeed a symptom of the fact that money is being recycled from italy back into german boons presumably because despite negative yields the carry and safety of being in boons is worth the risk to italian holders of euros and of italian bonds and obviously the haircut on boons is much lower so the boons can be used for repo and for other financing operations in addition by reducing short-term interest rates and the consequent application of the covered interest rate parity relationship the central banks are also encouraging unknowingly possibly the kind of speculation that has been discussed just a few minutes ago that by external buying of negatively yielding assets and converting them to positively unique assets you're allowing for external arbitrage now this state of affairs is not the first time it might sound unique but it has a very classic life cycle and it is deeply related to other forms of carry trades the currency carry trade is also very deeply related to the volatility in currencies and other asset classes and i wrote a paper in the journal of fixed income on this topic a few years ago the fact that currency volatility has remained incredibly low over the last decade has mitigated so far forced unwinds of leveraging the scary trade but the question is can it last indefinitely and currency volatility is extremely low so people think that there is no risk in currency carry trades but as we know when it unwinds it unwinds in a very rapid and uncontrolled fashion now one scenario in which currency volatility can rise sharply is a hiccup in risk assets that results in a rush into u.s fixed income assets for just protection of portfolios or due to an aggressive rate cut by the fed""]"

following one year that means that investing during a recession is one of the most profitable times to invest not to mention in the following three years after every single recession we have ever had

lot at advancing this goal and the next step towards moving to a system like this is going to be starting in about 53 days it's going to be launching right at the beginning of July which is why controversy is skyrocketed and you're seeing this covered everywhere Florida's governor Ron DeSantis called this an attempt for government surveillance and control a few days ago he signed the first in the nation legislation to protect against government surveillance of personal finances the bill prohibits the use of Central Bank digital currency in the State of Florida Texas as well just rolled out a similar bill and it's expected that more and more states are going to hop on this trend of banning Central Bank digital currencies however proponents of cbdc's have said that these are an essential step to protect the American Consumer and save the planet the Biden Administration for example has said that a central bank digital currency could and should protect consumers investors and the environment former FTX CEO and reverse philanthropist Sam bankman freed called Biden's approach constructive a lot of people are saying if he thinks it's constructive it must be a good idea right it must be very very good the IMF ran an opinion piece same at cbdc's can use less energy than existing payment systems and thus fight climate change and a lot of people are arguing out there today that hey if we could save just one polar bear over the next 500 years maybe it makes sense just to let the government control every transaction that we do because if they can allocate it well they can allocate it in a way that saves at least one polar bear obviously as humans were pretty selfish because we want to have like a good quality of life now but if we could just simply let the government control everything well maybe we wouldn't have such a good quality of life but maybe one or two more polar bears would be alive in 500 years but the fascinating thing about the cbdc program here in the United States and really everywhere abroad where they're trying this they're trying it in China they're trying it in Europe there's talks to try it in places like Australia but the fascinating thing about this Central Bank digital currency government currency digital version of whatever native currency whatever you want to call it is that it gives a lot of benefits to the government in terms of control in terms of actually being able to revoke currency if they think certain groups of people shouldn't have it in terms of limiting certain economic activity that they don't want to see like buying too much gas for example which could be a pollutant or for example just being able to see what you buy and sell gives the government a lot of control and surveillance capabilities but doesn't really give much in terms of benefits to the everyday citizen now obviously over the last few decades more and more people have felt that the government should have a bigger role in our lives and should control more things but this is one of those areas that you want to be really really careful because this might be a pretty core Freedom that you're going to lose Heartland reports perhaps most disturbing of all however is that under most of the cbdc designs discussed by the Biden Administration and Federal Reserve nearly all forms of ownership of cbdc money would also be strictly limited only large institutions such as Banks the federal government and or the Federal Reserve would actually have ownership of cbdc's everyone else would be prevented from having absolute control over their digital money now right now if somebody wants to go and give you a hundred dollars maybe you'll put it in a bank account and then the bank has those hundred dollars but you still technically have the hundred dollars yourself you're an ownership of them the hundred dollars can be inflated to the ground don't get me wrong"", ""and in the public sector AKA central banks they acknowledge that the stable coins being built by crypto are not always that stable and that the cbdc is being developed by central banks can increase the risk of Bank runs they note that the study will focus on the possibility that both types of digital currencies will integrate fully with the financial system for the purposes of the study the authors assume that these digital currencies will compete with bank deposits and if you watched our recent video about the banking crisis you'll know that Banks make money by investing deposits in other assets and they can be temporarily insolvent when the value of these assets go down naturally the authors are concerned that the ability for depositors to quickly withdraw their money as a cbdc or stablecoin could lead to financial instability as banks are forced to sell assets at a loss to honor withdrawals newsflash this is basically the cause of the current banking crisis in the United States what's interesting is that the authors predict that this outflow of deposits could be beneficial to asset prices this makes sense given that many of the outflows from banks that we've seen so far have been invested into U.S government debt AKA U.S bonds and some have been invested into alternative assets like gold and crypto what's fascinating is that the authors also predict that the benefits of digital currencies to households could outweigh the financial stability risks obviously they imply that this only applies when the digital currency in question was issued by the government and specified that stable coins should be restricted the authors then give an overview of existing literature about the subject they revealed that all existing research about digital currencies focuses on how they could impact the financial system during good times and bad times they believe that this study is the first to examine the effects of a full integration now when it comes to their mathematical model I must admit that most of it flew over my head but there are a few parts that stood out to me for starters the model assumes that cbdcs and cryptocurrencies are equivalent not surprisingly the model focuses on stable coins that are backed by U.S bonds for those who don't know most of the stable coins in circulation are backed by U.S bonds this means that when you buy a stablecoin you're effectively subsidizing the US government spending meanwhile the stablecoin issuers make mad money from the interest rates on their reserves this is why it's surprising that the model does not assume that stablecoins will earn interest but does assume that cbdcs will earn interest the model also assumes that each cbdc transaction will not be automatically taxed which is something that governments have discussed extensively in their research the model even makes some assumptions about how households invest their money but that maths is way above my pay grade I must admit following many more complex mathematical models and even more complex calibration the authors finally break down the results they analyzed what would happen if the supply of digital currency in the economy increased from 18 to 26 percent for regular reasons no crisis no Black Swan Etc the authors found that this small increase in digital currency Supply would make the financial system less stable and therefore increase the probability of a financial crisis it would also cause the value of Bank stocks to fall which makes sense given that Banks make money from investing customer deposits the authors also found that this small increase in digital currency Supply would provide a slight benefit to households this is due to the aforementioned increase in asset prices that would result from such digital currency issuance and also lower levels of asset price volatility due to all the extra liquidity the authors then showcase the risks to the financial system and benefits to households using two graphs as you can see keeping the supply of digital currency close to 18 would minimize risks and maximize benefits this ties into the next section about the optimal level of digital currency Supply as hinted by the graphs the less digital currency there is in circulation the lower the risks are to financial stability conversely the higher the digital currency there is in circulation"", ""the more benefits there are to households what's annoying is that the authors don't say what the ideal percentage is they explain that this is because it's not up to them to balance the risks and benefits of digital currencies that's presumably up to politicians however they do make an epic assertion cbdcs are a bigger threat to financial stability than stable coins this is the opposite of what you tend to hear these days they explain that this is because cbdc's are more analogous to bank deposits than stable coins this makes sense when you remember that the model assumed that cbdcs would earn interest whereas stable coins would not holding a cbdc would be the logical choice if that ends up being the case the thing is that existing literature about cbdc's well at least not the Central Bank reports we've summarized does not assume that they will earn interest in fact this literature suggests that cbdcs will actively lose value due to the taxes included in every transaction you'll recall the authors referred to this what's crazy is that even though cbdcs don't earn interest are taxed on every transaction and are unlikely to be adopted research still suggests that they will pose a threat to financial stability this is because Central Bankers seem to be under the impression that everyone will see cbdc's as the safest asset ever what's funny is that projections by the bank for international settlements or bis the literal bank for central banks suggests that only between 4 and 12 percent of people will voluntarily adopt cbdcs you'll know this if you watched our first video about cbdc's that will be down in the description it's a really good watch even if I do say so myself anyways the Assumption by the authors that cbdcs will pose significant financial stability risks seems to be a way to justify limiting the supply of stable coins this is because they State quote optimal regulation would limit the supply of digital currencies when the only risk is coming from cbdc's now this relates to the conclusion of the study wherein the authors spell it out plain and simple if digital currency truly becomes a part of the economy it will benefit households by a whopping three percent and double the risk to the financial system by an equally whopping six percent up from the three percent Baseline rookie numbers Jokes Aside the authors also highlight the scapegoat they created in the discussion quote digital currency whether privately or publicly issued is likely to be detrimental to financial stability and bank valuations can be significantly harmed despite these harms coming from cbdc's as per their own admission so this brings me to the big question and that's what this study means for cryptocurrency in contrast to the stated conclusion the study suggests that stable coins are a preferable alternative to cbdcs that said neither of the two are preferable if you want Financial Freedom in a digital currency system I've said it before and I'll say it again the true definition of Financial Freedom is the ability to transact when you want with whoever you want and for however much you want this kind of Financial Freedom doesn't seem all that important but it will be when stable coins and cbdcs become more common that's because stable coins and cbdcs are both centrally controlled this means that the issuers of these digital currencies will have the final say on all of your transactions be they stable coin issuers or central banks in other words it's ultimately the issuers of these digital currencies that own them not you we've already seen a few stories about stablecoin issuers freezing tokens associated with illicit activity although I haven't seen any stories about central banks doing the same with cbdc's their own documentation states that they will have this ability and will use it whenever they feel it's Justified if you watched our recent video about a speech given by fed Vice chair Michael Barr you'll know that one of the only differences between stablecoins and cbdcs is that stable coins will provide slightly more privacy protection this is because governments will need legal permission to access stablecoin data beside the fact that most governments will spy on stablecoin transactions regardless most stable coins exist on publicly viewable cryptocurrency blockchains this means that anyone will be able to see every transaction and the mandatory kyc at exchanges means it's easier to connect crypto wallets to identities on that note another one of the only differences between stable coins and cbdcs is that a digital ID is required for cbdcs to work this is why governments around the world are so focused on rolling out digital IDs""]"

Well now I wanna get this thing a little bit of room to wiggle around. So not the greatest candle I currently formed but like I said, you got to give things a little bit of wiggle room here. So let's see if it wants to get back below 195. It was a pretty quick turnaround. Not looking so good right now.

This is all live by the way. So this is happening as I record the video. This is not a voiceover or anything. So right there, I mean, the bid just went down below 184 and the offer now below 184.

it's awesome for tenants to have owners that just come fix everything that goes through a property manager and it goes through the correct means now all of a sudden the property manager can make even 50% of the problems solve over the phone like the ant example I gave and the other problems they can deal with by going through the normal processes and channels which are a little bit more inconvenient for the tenant which often times lead to a tenant maybe you should just replace the light bulb yourself rather than have us do it now here's something really cool if the tenants don't know you're the owner and you're a handy type and you work with your property manager to go take care of repairs yourself like little repairs the tenant that doesn't think you're the owner oftentimes we'll share complaints or secrets with you about the property manager the owner which is you or the building or the neighboring tenants which is really really kind of cool insight that they just volunteer to you but you have to be a good actor don't blow your cover and again if they ask you bluntly we have already established what you should say if they bluntly ask you if you're the owner now what about contracts people always wonder we'll wait a minute won't the owners name be on a contract no at least not in the state of California the California Association of Realtors uses a standard residential lease agreement that is signed by the tenant and the landlord but landlord is defined as the person who's in control of managing the property which could either be the property manager or the owner now what about the public records that show who the owners are and then people take those names and just Facebook who you are that's definitely possible some folks like to put their properties in a trust that they label the Mickey Mouse trust or they form an LLC like 1 2 3 East Main Street just some kind of generic name"", ""well I guess I have to go kill some ants this is super common by the way tenants almost always try to ask for more and more services so we have to keep their expectations in check as landlords or property managers so having this property manager be a filter for emotion and stress levels actually creates less litigious situations whereas resentment builds so high on either side that so many self-managing landlords end up with those cocktail stories where they talked about nightmare scenarios they had with tenants or how they ended up in court with tenants and guess what guess who usually wins in court the tenants that's where the expression tenants and toilets comes from people don't want to deal with tenants and toilets because it can be stressful and that emotion and stress combined creates a disastrous situation that's why the middleman is so powerful but what is the big secret what should you never tell a tenant well now that you understand this this is exactly what you should never tell a tenant never ever ever ever tell a tenant that you are the owner of the property we're not suggesting lie but here's a psychological fact that happens when you are the owner and you tell a tenant that you're the owner as soon as a tenant knows who the owner is every time they write that rent check they picture the face of the owner and how maybe they're paying for that Beamer lease the owner has or their mortgage or whatever and it builds resentment the bottom line is one human feels like they are giving somebody else something it's very weird when people rent from apartment complex they don't have this issue because it's a corporation for some reason that feels different when people write checks to a property manager it's like they're just paying to a company feels different they paid their home loan to a bank feels different but when they write a check to a homeowner and they see that homeowner buying beer at the grocery store like my rents paying for that beer and I'm struggling to make the payment that resentment the fact is there's nothing anybody can do about that it happens it could be avoided by preventing the tenant from finding out who the owner is again we're not suggesting lie I've got some suggestions here and some tips for how to actually handle this but the biggest advice is if you have a property manager don't be that owner that wants to show their ego and show how great they are for when the tenant goes to move in here comes the owner with the key to that house"", ""today we're talking about the number one rule of property management what you should never say to a tenant first to make sense of this rule we need to understand the middleman phenomenon or middle person to make you gender neutral although middleman rolls off the tongue a little easier so we're gonna stick with that one middleman is a slang term for an intermediary that provides a service but also charges a fee or a commission because of that it's sort of built a negative connotation over time but if you understand the concept of a middleman you'll understand the concept of what you should never tell a tenant coming up let's analyze this just like in real estate sales with buyers on one side and sellers on the other tenants sit on one side across the table from landlords and they each have different desires and perspectives because of this opposing relationship they naturally tend to have an adversarial relationship with the other party that is even though they're working together for their common benefit that is the tenant gets a place to live and the landlord gets rental income they tend to have an atmosphere relationship because the tenant generally wants to pay less in rent and be able to do more such as have dogs or paint walls whatever colors they want whereas a landlord wants to make less changes to the property do less repairs but collect more on rent the same is true for buyers and sellers buyers want to pay less sellers won again more there's no surprise here but this natural dichotomy creates a tinderbox for emotions guilt appeals to pity fake friendships and drama now this isn't to say that there aren't some landlords that don't have excellent relationships with their tenants or can be friends with their tenants and can get along and the bottom line is in almost any relationship when things are going good everybody's happy it's when things get a little bit more complicated that friend relationships can very quickly turn ugly now how does the middleman come into play with this and what should I never tell a tenant let's explain the concept of the middleman phenomenon by talking about a property manager I'm the property manager a property manager is a classic middleman who is incentivized by both the tenant being happy and the owner being happy to make the entire transactional process of a tenancy significantly easier and stress-free for all parties involved when both sides have expectations hopefully set by that great property manager and both sides follow the rules of the agreement that have been created again hopefully by that great property manager then generally the level of stress and a tendency can be very low all of this is under the guidance of that middle person see the property manager doesn't just make the process of a landlord tenancy relationship simpler by facilitating paperwork photos repairs or putting a property on the market a property manager is a classic case of the middleman somebody who can remove emotion from discussions convey local norms of what customs our culture dictate happen in a certain rental market balance the priorities of both the landlord and the tenant in a reasonable manner of course and conduct business in a communicative way so that nobody feels like they're left in the dark ultimately they filter out the drama and get to the facts they get to the bottom of things so that they can handle things in a reasonable manner the nature of a middleman now let's make an example of no property manager involved tenant has problem talks to owner hay owner that faucet you worked on last time is leaking again owners typical reaction ah whiny tenant go screw yourself the order may not actually say that""]"

start getting really good when you buy into something like an S&P500 index your investment is weighted by the market cap of each company meaning the bigger the market cap the more of your money goes to that particular investment in this case if you invested a hundred dollars into something like spy seven dollars would go into apple 5.9 to microsoft 3.75 to amazon and that continues until the smallest company only gets 0.014 of your money however in michael's case he's buying an equal proportion to every single company his goldfish picks that increases his chances of picking a smaller company that will see a higher return beating wall street bets and then making a video on youtube to flaunt the fact that you beat the brightest hedge fund managers in the world with a fish this same experiment was also simulated a thousand times back in 2013 with another goldfish and as you can see from the S&P500 in black the goldfish beat that return 96.4 percent of the time over a three-year period by an average of over 14 percent however at this point you probably got to ask yourself if doing this is so effective and it makes so much money why isn't everyone doing it well the reason is simple risk even though smaller companies outperformed by 1.7 96 of the time they also experienced significantly more volatility meaning just as much as they went up they also went down like if we compare the top 000 growth companies with the top 2 thousand value companies we could see that nearly every price movement in the value category is magnified by at least 20 to 50 percent and risk is something that every investor needs to consider when they think to themselves how much money do i want to risk versus how much do i want to make and for most investors choosing the short-term volatility of investing in completely random stocks usually does not beat the safety of investing in 500 different companies throughout an index and earning slightly less my own monkey portfolio is a perfect example of this like i mentioned throughout 2021 10 randomly pick stocks outperformed the S&P500 by a full 13 but in 2022 when i repeated this experiment again the monkey portfolio lost percent during a time where the S&P500 was only down three and a half percent does that mean the experiment is flawed or i just got unlucky no when the market goes up the monkey is statistically likely to do even better"", ""and they found that their monkey portfolio consistently beat the stock market by an average of 1.7 percent a year 96 of the time and it doesn't even stop there a goldfish's stock picks were simulated over a thousand times and beat the market by an average of 14.5 percent over three years there's also a cat who beat the market by eight percent a monkey named adam who beat jim cramer a chimpanzee who beat 94 of russian bankers and even a crypto trading hamster who beat warren buffett believe it or not there's actually a formulated reason why animals are able to get such a high return and it has nothing to do with luck chance or a secret world of headless chickens is depicted in south park instead it has to do with the strategy being used to pick stocks that tend to do well consistently over and over again and here's what they discovered research conducted in 2013 found that by randomly selecting 30 stocks out of the top 1 000 companies and buying them all in equal proportions you're increasing the chances that such a portfolio would contain smaller stocks which have the potential for even higher growth and because monkeys didn't get emotional and panic sell the moment jim cramer comes out with a spooky headline that led to an outperformance of the entire market year after year as proof of this between 1980 and 2015 smaller stocks returned 11.24 annual growth on average while large stocks returned eight percent so that just means when 30 stocks are picked at random while investing an equal amount in each you're more likely to include smaller stocks which would boost the portfolio's return when compared to an overall index and uh oops voila you beat the market now even though this sounds like the ideal way to invest before i have boo pick another 10 stocks for 2022 you're probably wondering well graham if it's really that easy then why is it everybody doing it"", ""it's not just random luck either because so many animals have proven to beat the market time and time again that a year ago i created my own experiment where i personally invested a hundred thousand dollars in 10 randomly picked stocks by the youtube monkey boo and guess what to my surprise at the end of the year the youtube monkey generated a 41 return and beat the entire S&P500 by 13 so even though michael reeve's algorithm i mean goldfish seems really really impressive just like a magic trick it's all an illusion and as it turns out there's a very simple reason why all of these animal portfolios do so incredibly well see when people pick stocks they do so by trying to profit from inefficiencies in the market that just means that they pick stocks which should in theory be worth more in the future based on their growth fundamentals projected earnings seasonality and trends so if professionals have all of these resources available at their disposal to pick the next big opportunities why can't they on a consistent basis better than an animal well that's what brings us to what's called the efficient market hypothesis this argues that the stock market makes no room for excess profits because everything is already fairly and accurately priced in or in other words stocks cannot be undervalued because its current price already includes its future growth value and earnings so the only way to make more money is by choosing riskier investments where the upside is directly proportional to the chance that you will lose money now of course there are investors like peter lynch or warren buffett who have outperformed the market over multiple decades but others argue that out of your probability at any given point in a market with enough people some will outperform the mean otherwise a winning strategy would only work until enough people figure it out at which point it would no longer be effective because everyone else is doing it but in the animals case the reason they perform so well is because it's kind of rigged in fact you could replace the animal with just about anything even a snail and it's going to do well just consider this research conducted in 2013 found that by randomly selecting 30 stocks out of a list of a thousand companies and buying them all in equal proportion you're increasing the likelihood that that portfolio would contain smaller stocks which have more potential for higher growth as proof of this between 1980 and 2015 smaller stocks returned over 11 on average while large stocks only returned 8 so that just means when animal stocks are picked at random while investing an equal amount in each you're more likely to include smaller companies which have a higher return than the overall index and voila he beat the market but now what about michael's situation because after all he bought into the S&P500 where every single company is worth over 5 billion dollars""]"

thousand tokens goes up to a dollar then it becomes a hundred thousand dollars to launch that same masternode and so and and at the same time you're you're building up your your computer that you're running the masternode on is basically building another node to this total network of nodes all working together processing transactions so forth and so doing a lot of different things to improve the security of the network so forth and so on that's why you're generating this yield so ultimately that's masternodes in a nutshell the the the trick is understanding which of these has the the potential for real growth uh you know brand new masternodes like I said are generally pretty cheap to get into but you have no real assurances to whether or not they're gonna go anywhere if the Project's gonna go anywhere and then it becomes more of a token evaluation of the team of the the project itself the company how long have they been in operation what has their price history been like over the last year two years five years how long have they been around um have there been any hacks so that that that is all a part of doing research in masternodes but running them can actually be pretty fun because it is a passive yield and if you make the right bet on a master node divi's to me has proven itself pretty uh successfully over the years I've met members of the team personally uh I've had some of them on my channel in the past that's not to say that Divi is the end-all be-all their primary uh use case is for remittance uh basically the ability to transfer funds from point A to point B internationally with minimal fees and they're building a lot of relationships in the banking industry and things of that nature um to continue to grow their use case and their reach and their expansion"", ""so but the tokens are basically a penny a piece now from here what you might want to do is you want to these these Master nodes pay out in their native tokens so with this you'd earn Divi tokens with Dasher earning Dash tokens so you have to understand and this is going to be different for every one of these masternodes which of these masternodes might be more worthwhile uh based off of their use case um you know so you would want to look into like well what does dash do what's the point of it what is Divi project what does Divi do and that's basically a matter of going into the website and and trying to understand like more about the project so this shows like weekly income paid out to all Divi Master nodes monthly yearly it gives you all the financial stats and generally speaking you know you're able to go to their website to find guides and tutorials because setting up each masternode is different there's no uh there's no one way for everything right every masternode is going to have its own specific requirements its functionality one of Divi Project's big claims to fame is the fact that it's super easy to set up the master node uh but this is all you know it's all relative to your your technical experience masternodes are generally very fruitful but the question is what use case does the masternode token actually offer and will that demand increase over time ultimately increasing the value of the tokens"", ""and we're seeing the investors are getting tons and tons and tons of IMX tokens over the next couple of years and even GameStop who received an IMX Grant they dumped every single token it's just not a very strong uh outlook for the tokenomics for the schedule of the unlocks so like on the website you see token sales public and private are only 19 but the problem with that is is that 19 is a first of all accounting for two billion tokens that's a lot of capital A lot of liquidity that's in that 20 and then second of all it's unlocking every single month here Robbie and the team are doing everything possible to kind of prevent the dumps trying to lock up tokens in the ecosystem and stuff like that but at the end of the day when you redistribute it to investors they can do what they want it's an open market and as mentioned it's a bear Market a lot of people want to secure liquidity in these time periods to be able to then accumulate at their levels of DCA Comfort whatever it is so that's just one example always check out the white list always check out the distributions because the schedule of release is so much more important than like this for example obviously great at 50 is going to ecosystem development but we've also seen the developer grants that can be dumped from that right you have to read between the fine lines always check out the white paper and look at the distribution schedules and how can you find more about distribution schedules without really digging not deep into every single white paper head over to token.unlocks.app and you'll actually be able to see all the upcoming unlocks in the space this is an incredible incredible platform to use to see what unlocks are around the corner you know when you can look for potential either a dips in tokens where you can then accumulate at a better price if the unlocks are slowing down Etc or if you're like a Trader most the time these are really good opportunities potentially for short traders in the market whenever you get a good unlock on a huge project most the time there is a bit of a dip we saw it play out with axi last month we're seeing it potentially play out we saw it layout with imx's last unlock and we potentially could see it play out once again but this is a great tracker to be able to actually go in here and check

earnings to go down this next quarter Apple also has a very high price to book ratio of sixteen point one three this means that the market cap is sixteen times higher than the book value of the company based on its balance sheet let's also take a look at their profitability as this is extremely important Apple currently has a profit margin of twenty one point three five percent and the operating margin of twenty four point four eight percent these are very solid margins and shows that Apple has really streamlined its manufacturing process and as a result they are getting a very good profit margin on their products and services another value I like to look at is the current ratio and you can see that for Apple it's currently 1.5 current ratio is basically the current assets divided by the current liabilities if we're looking more at the long-term we can also take a look at their total debt to equity which is their total liabilities on top divided by the shareholders equity higher numbers means higher risk to shareholders so 151 in this case is very high note that some industries like tech do tend to have very high de ratios now while I think Apple is such a great long-term growth stock"", ""at that time it dropped around 25 percent now in addition to that the stock price has also dropped between 25 to 35 percent many many times if that happened again right now in this macro environment which we're going to get to in a minute Apple would be between 125 and 110 dollars now if Apple happens to be in a classic distribution phase one 10 would be the beginning of the decline phase With It ultimately reaching 80 to 60 dollars as the ultimate outcome I am not predicting that but what I am asking is does it make sense to take profits at this current elevated level by at least using a trailing stop loss so if you get stop loss out you would be capturing some of the amazing gains that massive run-up that's been seen over the last decade you either are going to capture some of those gains or you're going to imagine that this thing is going to run for another decade taking Apple from a three trillion dollar market cap to a four or six trillion dollar market cap that's the question that you have to answer to be in Apple at this price and so to really get to the bottom of whether or not Apple can grow to become a four trillion dollar market cap company I think we've got to answer what is the macro moment that we're in will this macro environment allow for Apple to achieve those goals which today it very very much includes the conversation of the banking crisis JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie dimon said today that this seizure of First Republic puts at rest the excruciating period of panic for the banking system this part of the crisis is over he told analysts on his Monday conference call Jamie comes out"", ""this means that Apple stock trades out just about normal volatility and right now they have a current p/e ratio of twenty three point five three their earnings per share is actually quite a bit higher than it should be and this is because Apple loves to buy back its own stock the dividend yield for Apple is currently at one point one three percent based on its current valuation if we take a look at the six-month chart you can see that it hits high at the start of 2020 and then dip down to the low 200s in mid-march since then it's recovered back to about 90 percent of its all-time highs not that Apple has been its expected earnings for at least the last four quarters but you can also see that they did not issue any guidance for q2 of 2020 due to the uncertain markets and in 2019 they had revenue of about 260 billion dollars with profits of around 55 billion dollars let's talk about some of the news right now and later on I'll go into a more in-depth analysis so with the up and coming 5g Network Apple is supposedly pushing back its newest iPhone 12 by about one month this means that we should expect these new phones by October in terms of growth apples services revenue is up 17% to thirteen point three five billion dollars for the March quarter and their wearables and accessories division also gained about twenty two point five percent to six point two eight billion dollars in the same quarter now going back to why Warren Buffett loves Apple so much he actually normally does not like tech companies at all it's a sector that he doesn't really understand but he likes the view Apple as a consumer product company he says that he believes Apple is the best business in the world and would love to own the entire company if it were possible he loves the customer loyalty expanding services high profit margins and extremely strong balance sheet speaking of balance sheet let's do a quick but deeper analysis at this company's financials so Apple's current enterprise value is one point two nine trillion dollars right now this is just about where the market cap is and we talked about how Warren Buffett likes buying companies when they are currently under the enterprise value so right now it is a toss-up whether or not he would currently invest in Apple's also take a look at its forward p/e ratio of twenty four point two seven this means that its current share price is twenty four point two seven times the expected earnings per share""]"

I've heard all three, so let's just go with 7%. Let's cut it down the middle. Gardner: All right. I've often said 10% but that's not factoring in things like inflation. So if you take out 2% inflation money, since it tends to get printed more and more over time, it tends to be devalued when we print a lot of it. That's what creates inflation. And so if you're looking at historic returns for the market of 8-10%, but you deduct 2% every year for that, the real return is somewhere closer to that 6-7%. Good.

first let's take a look at some data because data is really important and if you go directly on a cdc's website this is the thing that doesn't look good so this curve right here should not be happening to this degree if this were 100 over you can actually see there's a rise of covet in the reports to the cdc there's also reports of several variations of the virus and keep in mind i don't know all of them but some of the ones you might have heard of are called alpha beta delta and gamma variants now this next part is just in case you were thinking about traveling so let me throw some numbers at you because the alpha variant was first detected in the uk beta in south africa gamma in brazil and delta in the us and india and out of all of these variants it's just our luck that delta is the one that's the most contagious and that's because at the beginning of this month roughly 50 of covet cases were because of this delta variant but now that number is up to 83 so it's actually spreading fast and that's because it's anywhere between 43 to 90 percent more contagious than that first strand so now half of congress has started to wear their masks and what's crazy is that even though 68.3 of all u.s adults have at least one vaccine those people in congress some of them have tested positive despite getting their vaccines which is kind of terrifying to think about because here we are thinking that the worst is behind us and we're back at it again daniel now i don't want to scare anyone but the best thing we can do is once again wash our hands don't touch our face stay six feet away get vaccinated and smash that like button and if you already got vaccinated your odds of getting sick are significantly lower than if you didn't get a vaccine at all now that's the good news is so far nothing has happened but if they were to happen here are some good signs to watch out for and here's what i would personally do first i would corner the entire market by buying up all the toilet paper all the used cars and all the lumber i could afford because people will always need to use toilet paper they'll always need to use lumber to build new houses and they'll always need cars to go to work and they'll always need to smash the like button score half kidding now there's a few signs that you should watch out for to know that something is about to happen and the first of these signs is the stock market will move very fast especially once the narrative changes to be more about fear and that's because as soon as people get scared they sell off very quickly and that's because between february to march of 2020 the stock market sold off something like 30 percent which is huge we had several days of the week where we had almost double digit drops march 9th""]"

money on a trade well the stakers earn the long-term vision of games network is to become the most adopted decentralized leverage trading platform in crypto games wants to become a dow governed by the gns token and create D5 products that can bring Revenue that can can be distributed in a gns staking pool and we're going to get into how to stake um gns and how to stake die and capture upside to what is a very exciting project in crypto Lewis Cooper did a very good thread that breaks down how gains Works quite simply he says the gns token is the lifeblood of the G trade platform it's two LPS plus Vault so it's got its gns pool its genus dipole and it's divulged by staking gns in the single-sided staking pool you will receive 32.5 of all revenue that g trade processes so basically the value accrual here"", ""is that the more trading Revenue that g-trade generates the more people that are trading on the network and we've seen this is increased it has increased over time significantly the more that stakers of GNX earn and that um is a pretty linear but also a pretty effective way in my opinion of paying yield to stake because we can see see the gns pool here which is on polygon and also arbitrim now which they are launching on very very soon the gns dipole is essentially a liquidity pool where you provide liquidity to also earn rewards so it pays out on positive trades and receives trading losses so obviously if you're betting on the dipole you're betting on Traders over time losing money and the protocol making money um and the protocol having a house Edge which in general most exchanges do because most people actually lose in trading that's just kind of how trading goes and the exchanges are obviously the beneficiaries of this Dynamic and that's why um they kind of see the house always wins in this case gns is the house and if your staking die you're getting exposure to the essential losses of Traders which over time have been growing and growing as the platform gains in traction the gns token has been deflationary since its Inception stakers are not being paid with newly minted token liquidity"", ""and you can trade short you can also trade a variety of assets I'll show you an example on ethereum that's another pair that you can trade you can also trade stocks you can trade some Forex as well so there's many options to trade so let's say I want to sit um set a limit order on ethereum I can do the exact same thing of course now I only have one die in my wallet because I have a pending transaction but if you had available funds you can of course set the leverage here um and open uh limit order on ethereum either short or long and there's many other assets I think that's one of the major draw cards of games it's that you have many other assets to take advantage on so overall pretty clean pretty easy user experience when it comes to opening trades and that's why I like it and of course it will be on arbitrim soon so you'll have polygon and arbitrim that you can trade on remember if you do want to trade on games Network there is a link in the description of course use the link in the description if you want to do any trading and I'm going to try and get a giveaway sort of for you guys that actually sign up you just simply click on my referral link it is the first link in the description and you can start trading on G trade right here let's get into the Vault side of things because not all of you are Traders now of course one of the ways to capture exposure to games without trading yourself is actually via providing liquidity one of the ways to do this is via staking die in the G vault which is currently paying a 4.1 apy and is also now launched on arbitrum so you can do so on arbitrim or polygon as gains starts to roll out onto the arbitrant network as well if you stake die you are essentially representing your ownership in the vault so stakers of dire receive fees for each trade placed on the platform in exchange for serving as the counterparty to all trades obviously to power trades on the network they need liquidity so if you provide liquidity the people that are trading on the other side are using your liquidity to essentially be paid out and processed transactions if the Traders lose money the people that are staking to the Vault the liquidity providers they earn more if the Traders make money then the gdivault becomes less profitable but the theory is here that Traders actually aren't profitable and because the house always wins over time the stakers in the G diver will make more money as more people use the platform and there's more fees now of course there are risks where it comes when it comes to oracle-based dexes um and one of one of the major risks is that some kind of expert Point um or profitable trading strategy which wipes the pool be aware of that risk I'm just showing you guys the platform and giving you the option to stake if you are bullish on games and if you choose to do so I'm not necessarily saying that you have to of course you can just trade on the platform like everyone else but if you wanted to take it a step further and you like the platform and you're bullish on the platform then one way to capture exposure is through the G dive Vault the other way to capture exposure is of course through the gns pool which pays out to stakers based on how much fees the platform is earning and if we look at June analytics we can see that daily trade volume has been steadily increasing over time as well as users and obviously fees are represented in die have also increased despite dropping from last year but considering it's a bear Market this has been a pretty solid performance for gains Network and I think it's just off the back of having like a very usable product and I think it's launch on arbitrim that can also be a potential Catalyst to get more users into the platform and I think it holds it in much better stead uh long term being on arbitrim as well so of course if you do want to uh want to purchase DNS and stake it and capture upside to that then you can do so under their staking um section here you can buy gns if you click this button it will take you to Quick swap to buy gns you can approve it and then stake it as well and if you want to bridge funds across from polygon to arbitrim to stake on arbitrim they've got a bridge if you click on the bridge tab here which allows you to bridge assets across once again I want to make it clear that I'm not paid to promote the gns token or the staking my primary goal here is to show you guys how to use the platform but obviously part of that is showing you how to use the staking functions as well""]"

passes away says number one a loss of income number two it could be an unexpected and unmanageable expense in most situations that is medical some sort of thing that happens that costs you thousands and thousands of dollars I just had knee surgery and the total cost not to me thank goodness because we have good light good insurance was five thousand dollars and I look at that I'm like what would I have done if I didn't have insurance or if I didn't have particularly good insurance so thank you motley fool by the way we're taking care of my knee but it might not be medical could also be car repairs home Pairs having to bail out other relatives there are lots of reasons why you could have a big-ticket unexpected expense and then number three a significant loss of assets and property so it could be your portfolio takes a significant dive now if it's a well diversified portfolio over this time period it has recovered but that does not the case for everyone they might have had too much of their money in company stock they might have a business or something that went under it could be like we mentioned the home foreclosure or it could be for some people it's actually as simple as a loss of transportation right for the for probably average people listening to this podcast if something happened to your car you probably have insurance or you'll be able to pay but a lot of people especially if you're working an hourly job if you lose your transportation you've lost a lot of your income especially if you then have to rely on something like uber or something like that until you can save enough to get another car so those are the three main reasons why someone has some sort of financial calamity"", ""when you least expect it a natural disaster could completely tear apart your home or an illness could throw all of your plans out the window now that's not to say that you should live your life around getting bit by a shark after your car breaks down while you were driving back from the hospital to treat a rare illness after getting fired but it is to say that you should have a plan in place just in case one of those or two of them were to happen at the same time in this case save enough on the side to make sure that if you lose your job you'll be okay for the next three to six months make sure you have the proper home insurance to make sure you're covered in the event of a disaster go and get regular checkups so that if something were to happen at least to catch it early and spend money maintaining your cars so that it'll last another 100 000 miles all of these things can proactively help you in the long run so that that way you're financially prepared for anything that comes your way including Carol Baskin and finally number nine is not having a plan think of it this way when you go on a road trip you know your final destination and you have a map that's showing you exactly how to get there but when it comes to someone's life or finances most people just wing it and hope that eventually they end up where they want to be unfortunately though life never really works that way and unless you have a plan you're probably not going to achieve it this means figuring out what you want to be doing how much money you'll realistically need to save and where your priorities are I think most people would be shocked to learn that they don't need the tens of millions of dollars to live the life they think they want and they haven't come to terms with the fact that they don't want to run a multi-billion dollar Global Empire just carefully think about exactly what you want to do throughout the day and how much that's realistically going to cost then work backwards to figure out exactly how you can achieve that for example a waterfront home in Florida could be a million dollars Home Furnishings could be another fifty thousand dollars a used Ferrari could be a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and six thousand dollars a year in maintenance going out to restaurants is another two thousand dollars a month maybe spend two thousand dollars a month on hobbies and another two thousand dollars a month on miscellaneous stuff all in you would be able to buy that lifestyle for 1.2 million dollars in one time costs and one million nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars invested though even though that might seem like a lot of money you could get there by investing twenty four thousand dollars a year at an eight percent return over the next 30 Years essentially that's just you maxing out your 401K throughout your entire career and voila you got that retirement now for the rest of your life so if you haven't already done the math add it up because I promise you're probably not going to get there unless you know exactly where the destination is so with that said you guys thank you so much for watching I really appreciate it as always feel free to add me on Instagram and don't forget that you can also get a free stock with all the way up to a thousand dollars with our sponsor puppet.com Down Below in the description when you make a deposit with a good gram enjoy thank you so much and until next time"", ""so they just go and spend it so really the only way to fight this is to first acknowledge that lifestyle inflation is unavoidable it's going to happen to all of us and it's really important to work with it rather than just not acknowledge that it exists or think it doesn't apply to us and the easiest way to begin working with this is by paying yourself first every single paycheck before you spend any amount of money put a set amount aside that you do not touch under any circumstances for any reason whatsoever just pretend that that money doesn't even exist before it even hits your account and that way there's no chance of you ever spending it i personally recommend setting aside at least 15 to 20 of your monthly paycheck each and every month if you're able to save more than that then by all means that that will just make me even happier but just get in the habit of starting to do this consistently to prevent yourself from spending any excess money that you might have ramsay get down now when it comes to that another concern i see is that a lot of the millennials featured in these videos do not have any sort of emergency fund at all in fact sometimes it seems as though their only emergency fund is just a credit card which like i said ends up costing you significantly more than you ever need to spend if you don't have the money to pay it off immediately now for those that don't know an emergency fund is basically money you set aside to only be used in the event of an emergency where you otherwise have no other option to turn to ideally the amount in this emergency fund should be equal to three to six months worth of your living expenses and kept easily accessible for emergencies and remember when it comes to this an emergency fund is not money that you set aside just to frivolously spend as you want to it's not money that you set aside to go and invest with it's just money that you have at your disposal in case she hits the fan and you need something on short notice like if you lose a job you need to pay rent you need to pay for food your car breaks down or anything like this you got your money there already and the reason you shouldn't be investing this money is because on short notice your investments might be falling at a time where maybe you need it the most like for instance let's say a recession happens and stocks drop 30 in price and then all of a sudden you lose your job and you need your emergency funds so you start selling off your stocks after they've already dropped 30 in price when chances are you shouldn't really be selling those stocks instead you should always aim to keep your emergency fund in a high interest savings account where it's safe and where you're guaranteed to get a return on your money even if that just means you're keeping pace with inflation you could go and use ally bank which pays you 1.9 percent in interest you can go and use wealthfront which pays you 2.32 in interest or a myriad of other options out there that you have to choose from just do me one favor and make sure you get at least 1.9 in interest on a high interest savings account so that that way you can make the biggest use of your money now given all of those previous mistakes here's a bit of a backwards mistake that some people just tend to fall into because they end up too careful with money and from that they don't end up getting a credit card it's okay to err on the side of caution and make sure you don't go into debt and only spend money that you have available in your account that is all good""]"

down on the three daily chart if we bring up the bollinger bands they've been constricting even on the weekly chart you can see that they are starting to converge on themselves that means that the interest in the space as well as the volume and the volatility are all declining we see that in youtube viewership statistics our viewership is down every single channel on youtube has lower viewership right now as well as google trends you can see over the last 12 months the keywords bitcoin and crypto over on google have lost a substantial amount of their search interest in fact we can see the key search term crypto is sitting at 14 right now compared to 44 in late october that means nearly two-thirds of search activity for the word at crypto has completely evaporated in the last four months but is this something that we should be scared of or should we look at this instead as a golden opportunity to invest in ourselves so that we're able to reap the rewards and harvest the spoils the next time bitcoin goes into a rally well let me tell you a story about when i got into the cryptocurrency space we're going to go all the way back to july 31st of 2017.""]"

then they tried to hide from it"", ""yes so if we just check so that amount is larger than zero and we put the code inside of the function in this condition and we formally verified we see that we see that the error is now gone and this and as an IC o---- investor as a non-technical person as we mentioned it will be very very hard for you to actually understand what's wrong but what I suggest you to do is just count the red line see how many red lines there are and that will give you a very very rough estimate of how well this this code is written is it written by somehow who is just experimenting with solidity and never really develops really solid easy before then you might see many red lines or if there is a professional team developing you might see fewer lines because the thing is is it it is easy to write solidity code that works but that is not secure so it's very easy to write code that works and if someone has programmed in Java or JavaScript and they just arrived in solidity they will be able to write smart contracts but by using this tool you as an IC o---- investor actually have the opportunity to make sure that the projects you are investing in have professional developers who are not making these very very basic mistakes that this tool will will point out for you so secure Sakura Phi that CH is the tool number one of course on a more practical note as much what you do is you go to github and you find your project that you're interested in and that you're planning to invest in and you take some of their contracts and you paste them here and you count the red lines that mine might sound very trivial that you're just counting red lines but this is my recommendation I would definitely recommend a non-technical person to paste a contract and count the red lines and somehow get a picture of the quality of the code so this was the part of the video where we discussed how you as a non-technical person may be an IC o---- investor can make sure that the code is more or less well written and that a professional has written it now I want to show you another tool that anyone who has some kind of technical knowledge can use so thing is you don't have to use Sakura Phi if you have technical knowledge you could use or went instead I'm not sure how you pronounce it""]"

information prior to your purchase is the right thing to do and by extension asking the seller questions is a method that should be applied sensibly so let me explain why this isn't the right thing to ask when buying a vintage watch many have read somewhere the subject is relevant or even mandatory yet failed to realize that unpolished isn't a condition standard at all if you aim at a New Old Stock example it's wishful thinking for most popular brands tool watches especially disqualifying 99 of them and leaving a few exceptions in a different price bracket regardless a watch can be unpolished but worn out or properly polished but in pristine condition a resume rather the degree and quality of polishing is of importance over polished however is a condition standard and only let Specialists do the job some art designs are so skilled they can make it appear mint even Brands themselves offer laser recharge services like AP Patek some Rolex centers like Bexley and subsequently it sadly is sometimes advertises and Polished by the seller or some auction house it is very hard to determine the difference between truly unpolished and refurbished even if you have cognizance condition is of the utmost importance"", ""and sometimes it may indeed indicate that the previous owner took great care of his price possession and surely you should pay whatever you think something is worth in some cases I too would pay a couple thousands extra I like the colored accessories coming with the beach Daytona said the quirky two-door peanut box or the Omega crater box for example some cool provenance of the previous owners appreciated too but especially with vintage Rolex the premiums are Justified for all the wrong reasons and simply too high do as you please but let this serve as a caution and remember you can't wear a box and or papers over to our next subject Investments and regardless of what you've read or heard generally speaking wristwatches are a terrible performing asset compared to the Dow Jones Metals real estate Etc bear in mind the majority of timepieces plummeted value officer purchase think about that Armani Versace Tommy Hilfiger stuff and not only the cheap watches show tremendous downside on the resale side how about the blow Panerai some highly complicated pieces from Brands like at ABC or the Lion's Share of betual executions with that being said the luxury watch Market in particularly established Brands and more recently Independence potentially have an interesting Roi yet it's easy to discard pieces as a bad investment but nobody can answer you what's the best investment any dealer claiming this and selling your watch as such is full of  and should be avoided at all times even if one would be able to answer that question why would he be selling it then now the interesting question arises should you speculate with watches I would always prioritize an investment in your enjoyment rather than financial gain"", ""moreover manufacturers did an intent for boxes to be kept for many years they were merely used as packaging material usually made of cheap and perishable materials like cardboard pleather and plywood just have a look at your average Patek Omega hours Ultra box from the previous Century you can almost see them disintegrate before your very eyes it is uncommon for someone to have kept the original boxing papers for decades and as per usual in the World of Watches if something is rare becomes desirable and that's valuable occasionally boxing papers can command premiums up to 25 percent most notably regarding vintage Rolex watches so are you being swindled if you decide to pay up firstly that's the bunker common misconception boxes nor papers guarantee originality they don't tell you whether a watch is in an altered condition or even genuine at all you could have a Rolex where the cereal matches the original papers but with all components of the watch being changed the dial could be a service placement it could be refinished or even completely aftermarket or Worse the serial number from the original papers could be re-engraved into any watch genuine or fake if the papers are indeed original in the first place well Swiss Precision is often copied but never duplicated the same can't be said of warranty papers or cards banknotes are created with all kinds of anti-counterfeiting features but there are still organizations out there that can fake them so well that most wouldn't be able to tell now imagine the money that can be made by counterfeiting a warranty paper that was never made in a way that would prevent people from Faking it I've held an original Rolex warranty certificate in my left and a fake one in my right hand and even I had difficulty separating them despite years of experience the fake paper even smelled vintage because they were kept in an old Book for a couple of months besides fake papers there are also many original papers that were just never filled out you can buy them by the Dozen at any watch fair or even online it'll cost you a couple of hundreds but can add thousands in value doesn't that sound ridiculous and before you start about the so-called punch papers from Rolex vintage punch machines have notoriously been sold online alongside dealer stamps which two are being duplicated in other words it's not that difficult to produce 100 correct papers and nobody will be able to prove they're not original just add a period correct box some booklets that you bought of eBay and voila you've successfully added some serious value to the watch after extensive research it's safe to assume at least half of the Rolex watches with paper produced prior to 1990 are currently supplied without the certificate they were actually born with therefore if anything regarding confidence being offered a vintage Rolex with papers makes me more suspicious some brands also offer extract services or even reports of authenticity this alongside service papers may be considered next up I would like to tackle the argument that a full set is a better investment the value in the secondary Market is a result of supply and demand whilst the supply of vintage watches with warranties magically increases the demand diminishes because people start to realize the scam resulting in a declining premium at best another often made excuse of limiting purchases to full sets is that it would be easier to sell after this plea you might consider that as arguable I'm also denying the claim of some the true collectors to see complete specimen hence the term collector set but all

caught headlines before as well one of them being uh when the roth ira data got leaked for a couple of famous people including ted wesler we actually found out that ted had grown his individual

i estimate that he probably returned about 32 percent a year over that 29 year period which is just astronomical returns and we also saw a relatively recent investment from uh ted whistler as well which was his investment in dillard's made in 2020 there was some sec filings that he had bought dillard's personally presumably it was too small to be done within berkshire"", ""but before we get into that we do have a sponsor for this video and today's sponsor is hatch now hatch have been my personal broker of choice for me as a kiwi buying shares in large u.s companies for more than a couple

blowing story i actually came across this just over the weekend as i was listening to the after dinner investor podcast uh if you aren't already listening to that definitely go check it out highly recommend um and it's really interesting to see some of the stats that pro publica have been releasing so there was quite a lot of information that propublica had actually picked up and have sort of been uh drip feeding us more and more interesting information about the finances of of some people based over in the us so the most recent story was around some of these iras individual retirement accounts there are a couple of pretty big names in that list uh ted westler obviously is the topic for this video uh but we also actually had peter thiel who you will probably know as the co-founder of paypal and an earlier investor in facebook amongst other things uh peter thiel actually turned his 2 000 ira into more than five billion dollars now he actually did that by using stock deals and some other things that aren't available to the general public so as ridiculously impressive as that is uh in this video i want to focus on ted wesler now like i say ted wesler is uh 50 of the ted and told duo at birch hathaway working under warren buffett uh and ted wesler actually has a pretty interesting story of how he got the job at berkshire hathaway so uh warren buffett is famous for having these annual charity auction lunches so you can literally bid to have lunch with warren buffett and take a handful of your friends along with you uh some of the famous winners in the past of course mean people like guy spear and monash babri as well ted wesler actually won this auction two years running so in 2010 he paid 2 million thousand 626 hundred and eleven dollars to have lunch with warren buffett uh and then the following year in 2011 he paid two million six hundred and twenty six thousand four hundred and eleven dollars so he upped his bid by a hundred dollars from 2010 to 2011 uh"", ""but then you could continue to compound tax free and pull the money out at the intex free and ted wesler did actually choose to do that and in a year where he expected to pay less than a million dollars in income tax he paid actually over 20 million dollars in tax because of that ira conversion so sure there are millions and millions of dollars in that particular account that are going to continue to be tax-free forever and ted wisler has more money than he's probably ever going to need but still the government were able to benefit quite handsomely uh from that conversion that ted whistler went through from an ira to a roth ira when they were really struggling for cash now although this is a amazingly cool story that i would love to get more details on in terms of how ted whistler has compounded at such a high rate there are a couple of really key takeaways for me and one of the main ones that i've mentioned in previous videos is actually to do with the berkshire hathaway 13f so today as i said earlier ted wesler is investing some of berkshire hathaway's equity portfolio uh and this has really prompted me to pay a lot more attention to some of the smaller stuff in the berkshire 13f so in the past i've really been guilty of only paying attention to the big positions in bookshathway's 13f only really paying attention to what warren buffett might be doing and you know what's happening in the top five or ten names but after reading this i really want to pay more attention to some of the smaller investments in the portfolio if something's changing in the top five or ten positions it's unlikely to be ted or todd but if something's changing down the bottom and there are some new investments that come into the portfolio i'm going to use this as some motivation to look a little bit harder than i have done in the past at some of those smaller investments so that's it for me for this one i do hope you enjoyed the video and me sharing that story of ted wesler's incredibly impressive ira account i will leave a couple of links down in the description so if you want to check out the statement from ted wesler that will be down in the description as

Now once we come up the fair value and this is key we need to try to be honest with ourselves as to our level of confidence with our calculation of the fair value. So with the Disney pick as an example I would classify after the research I had done that I was highly I would classify that one as highly confident with the J.P. Morgan one I would say was close not quite as high as Disney. But I'll say pretty confident or a fairly confident with the apple one I was probably a little less confident. Now that might have to do with the fact that I like this kind of cash flow which I used for Disney and I and price to tangible book value which is what I use for J.P. Morgan. I like those two methods and they apply very well to that situation. I used PE for Apple and price to earnings. To me it's among the weaker valuation techniques. So I was okay with it but I wasn't thrilled with it."", ""That's the beautiful part to investing is you could just move on to the next company. There is tons of good companies out there. Okay. So using Disney back in the day we did the research. The stock was trading at about one hundred fifteen dollars a share. Well I believe that the fair value at that time was one hundred twenty two dollars per share. So when we buy Disney we wanted to be with a 15 percent margin of safety below our calculated fair value. So if we multiply 122 times point eight five a concert 15 percent. We get one hundred and four dollars a share. Now this is a chart of what Disney looks like on the day we created where at the very end the day we created the video. That was when the research was done. So as we could see Disney stock needed to get all the way back to this level before we'd meet our margin of safety requirements. But that's OK. That would do the same thing for J.P. Morgan. Well we apply our 20 percent margin of safety to our fair."", ""Well I did the apple video back in September of last year and the price is about 220 and I used a forward PE valuation and we made the case that the fair value of the stock was about two hundred and forty dollars. At that time with Disney we researched that one back in October. The stock was about 115 at the time and I made the case to the fair value the stock should be about one hundred twenty two dollars per share and with Disney stock we use a discounted cash flow technique and then jumping over to JP Morgan. Well here we use price to tangible book value to value the stock. The stock was at about 103 at the time and we made the case that it should be worth about one hundred and ten dollars per share. Now I'm using these three examples because in each of these cases where we use a different valuation technique to try to determine the fair value of a stock. Now I want to point something out. I always try to use the term fair value and not price target.""]"

There's also going to be a link down in the description below. So let's start off with some statistics about farmland in the United States. Well, first of all, there are 911 million acres of farmland in the US, and over half of the acres are rented rather than owned. So, a lot of people are actually buying farmland as an investment, and then renting it out to a farmer as a means of income or potentially preservation of wealth as well. 45% of US farmland is in small family farms, and 80% of rented farmland is owned by non-operators. Now, here in the United States, the top three crops grown are number one, corn, number two, soybean, and number three, wheat. So if you have ever driven all over the US, which I actually did a couple of weeks ago, it was amazing to see all of these massive corn fields and soybean farms all over the country."", ""Number two, direct purchase of farmland or a particular farm, that would be if you went out yourself in your local area or somewhere in the country and found a farm, got a mortgage, bought it yourself, and then rented it out most likely to a farmer or decided to be an owner operator, and farm that land yourself. Number three is the one that is growing in interest much quicker, and that is investing in farmland via crowdfunding. That is where people from all over the place kick in a investment towards a particular farm. They all invest together and there is a separate entity managing the farm related duties. Now, we're gonna cover the basics here in this video guys, but if you looking to learn more about farmland investing, I actually have a completely separate blog that I started exclusively about investing in farmland about a year ago. It has free guides for beginners. We have reviews of pretty much every single farmland investment platform available today. Right now on the blog, we also have comparisons as well as podcast interviews with many of the top farmland investment platforms."", ""You could do really well or it could do poorly, but it's all dependent on that one particular farm, and whatever crops are being grown there. And those local weather patterns and different elements. This is gonna have low liquidity, but low volatility because it's not a major exchange. It's a physical farm, an actual piece of real estate. Higher level of complexity and much higher costs. Crowdfunded sort of gives you the best of both worlds. You have better return potential than REITs. There is lower liquidity. So, you do have to be in it for the long haul. This is not the type of investment where you put your money in for six months and take it out. In most cases, it's gonna be probably a five plus year time horizon, but you're gonna have that low volatility, because you're not correlated to the stock market, a little bit more complexity, but a lower cost, more complexity than the REIT, but obviously, less than a direct investment in farmland. However, if you do decide to use one of these crowdfunded platforms in particular AcreTrader, they have a whole team that manages all of this for you.""]"

businesses you tend to be paying a premium to the equity that sits on the balance sheet in other words you're paying more than one times the price to book ratio for that company you might be paying two or three or even four times book which is about the multiple actually that uh charlie munger initially bought into costco back in 2000 and even though he paid that high premium to book value he's clearly had a very very good result and one of the key reasons for that is this reinvestment engine that costco has they can take the profits generated from their costco memberships and costco stores and redeploy that into basically opening more stores and they can kind of just roll that snowball down the hill and do that over and over and over again now walking through a very simple mathematical example let's say that you have a business that consistently earns a 20 return on equity and let's say it can continue redeploying new funds new earnings kind of into their reinvestment engine they can continue to grow the business"", ""and basically they are generally influenced by things like how much debt that particular company has so if we add back the interest payment and we add back the tax uh we basically have a way of comparing the profitability of different businesses regardless of how well financed they are so regardless of whether they have no debt or a little bit of debt or a moderate amount of debt or a lot of debt uh we can compare companies on sort of an equal basis so that if an acquirer were to go into that company and just buy out the whole thing and pay off all the debts and you know pocket the cash or whatever it might be uh all businesses are on an even playing field if we use ebit as opposed to earnings now i would be remiss not to say that if you go too far down this track of modifying earnings and using things like ebitda especially uh our boy charlie munger back here will start to uh call that out as profit because that has taken away some very real costs through depreciation especially uh but ebit is a very useful metric like i say to compare the profitability of different companies uh regardless of their financing structure and again just like a pe ratio the higher that number the higher the price people are paying for the current earnings of that business or the current ebit of that business and the lower the number the lower the price that people are paying for the current ebit of that business but we're also in this case factoring in some of the balance sheet stats so if you have two businesses that have the same ebit and the same market cap for example you will tend to see a lower eve bit if the company has more cash and less debt and you'll see a higher eve bit if they have more debt and less cash so incorporate some of those balance sheet numbers and it's a really useful way to incorporate that overall sort of financial statement analysis into a simple easy to use metric so there you have it those are the three metrics that i probably use most commonly as a initial screen to get a feel for whether a business might be cheaper expensive uh the p e ratio the price to book ratio and the acquirer's multiple ev2 ebit again none of those metrics on their own replace a full discounted cash flow or intrinsic value calculation but they are a great starting point to very quickly screen out businesses that are just going to be way too expensive or find businesses that might be worth further investigation and doing a bit more digging so i do hope you enjoyed that video and learned something from it if you're interested in the hatch offer you will need to go to the link hatch dot a s forward slash investing on tom"", ""we're going to talk about is the price to book ratio and the price to book ratio is again a fairly easy to get kind of metric for most companies if you look up a business on something like yahoo finance search the stock ticker and look up some key statistics you'll pretty much always see a price to book ratio and this is one of those metrics that is really really useful for some businesses and not so useful for other businesses so let's first describe what the price to book ratio is again just like the p e ratio we have a price factor and we're dividing that by some other number in this case book value now book value is simply the assets of the company minus any of the liabilities so if the business owns a bunch of buildings and a bunch of intellectual property for example those are all assets if they have some long-term debt then that would be a liability so you take the assets you take away the debt and the kind of net amount that equity that you are left with is what's called book value in accounting terms so when you look at a price to book ratio if you see a price to book ratio of less than one you're basically seeing a business that is trading for less than that book value uh you can buy it for half of sort of the net worth of that company for example if the book value was 0.5 or if the book value was something like 3 for example you're paying many multiples of sort of the net worth that is built into the balance sheet of that company now like i said earlier there are some businesses where the price to book ratio is really useful and other businesses where the price to book ratio is really a complete waste of time and it basically comes down to looking at how that particular company earns money now if the business is in some sort of industry where the amount of assets that that company has basically directly controls the amount of income and earnings that that business generates that's a situation where the price to book ratio can be quite useful so a classic example here is something like a real estate business now a real estate businesses income is basically entirely driven by how much real estate the company has there's really no way that a real estate company can go ahead and earn a really dramatically higher amount of income without increasing the asset value in its portfolio increasing the book value in that company so things like real estate companies things like farms things like banks or insurance companies those are all industries where the assets of the company hugely dictate the amount of money that those businesses can earn and for that reason the price to book ratio is a metric that's really useful when you're analyzing those companies at least on a surface level before you do a deep dive into some of those companies so if you come across a real estate company for example or a bank or insurance company and you see that the price to book ratio is well below one it's trading at far less than the book value or the uh equity value of that company then that is something that may be of more interest to you and something that is potentially undervalued but there are a wide range of businesses where the amount of assets that they have does not necessarily dictate how profitable those companies are going to be and these are companies that can quite rationally be priced at many multiples of their book value so a company like apple for example comes to mind apple can increase their profitability by selling new services or increasing the price of their iphones or selling more iphone units are really without spending a whole bunch of money on creating new assets so apple coca-cola microsoft any business that really is brand heavy and produces a large amount of money on a relatively small asset base those are the types of businesses where the price to book ratio is really not particularly useful uh as the businesses profitability is really not dictated by the amount of assets that are sort of on that company's balance sheet in terms of how i use this metric personally basically if it's one of these businesses that produces a lot of profit on a relatively small asset base and it's really not the asset size that dictates their profitability that's the type of business where i will just completely ignore the price to book ratio but if it's a business where the assets are sort of the main driver of how profitable that company becomes over time uh then that is a situation where i will be far more interested in the price to book ratio and really what i'm looking for is if it's in and around one or especially if it's below one uh that is a situation again where it's not necessarily guaranteed to be undervalued but it's a situation where i'm able to say that this business could potentially be undervalued it's possibly trading below intrinsic value and it certainly warrants more digging from me as an investor now the third and final metric that we're going to talk about in this video is ev to ebit which is sometimes referred to as the acquirers multiple because of this book the acquires multiple where they talk about eve but and basically uh really interestingly if you had simply just bought the lowest ev ebit stocks in the stock market consistently over a long period of time you actually would have produced a 17.5 percent compounded return from 1973 through to 2017 compared to about 10.2 percent on the S&P500 and that was basically the topic of this book by tobias carlile the acquirers multiple""]"

so we have people from germany berlin we have people from belgium nottingham some people from mars even watching us idoha we have denmark our member jasper thank you very much"", ""but if the pause doesn't come in June then July probably is when the pause is going to happen the market is also pricing in a good chance that rate Cuts could start as soon as September this chart here shows that from the time rate hikes are paused until the first cut happens can last anywhere from 1 to 15 months six months is technically about the average here in most cases recessions are officially declared within a few months of the First Rate Cuts happening although not always we have a lot of mixed data here sometimes recessions don't come for years after the rates are cut which could happen this time or not currently the inflation is high though higher than any other year on this chart here economic growth is also low lower than any other year on this chart here the S&P500 earnings forecasts at 18x is second highest on the chart since the.com bubble which is not something you really want to be compared to growth is at the lowest at four percent Silver Lining here is that in all cases the S&P500 put in higher returns in the three months following interest rate hike pauses and in most cases not all but most cases we saw that markets were actually much higher 12 months after the FED paused rate hikes except in the.com boom again but then again the.com era rate hikes actually the pause coincided with the market top not a low like right now our current market structure very very different from the.com heroin rates started changing in many ways right now we're in uncharted waters we see a lot of mixed data there by the way right now we're seeing Equity markets are having near wreck levels of shorts so it seems some players a lot of players in fact think the worst is yet to come so is the crowd wrong are we gonna have big short squeeze washing all these guys out or are they right let me know what you think Down Below in the comments section now before we talk about who has been buying up all of that Bitcoin if you are a Trader then you need yourself to count over on Bible is the best place for trading Futures they have crazy good spot altcoin markets they do very popular copy trading service and if you use that link Down Below in the description to start your account you're getting a 30 000 up to thirty thousand dollars in deposit and trading bonuses as well as a limited time offer of a free one thousand dollar BTC usdt trading position which you can claim exclusively using that link to start your account let's get in here and by the way charts back to it crazy thing is here with all the craziness going on that fear and uncertainty around what the FED is going to or not going to do as the S&P500 doing well the S&P500 has been rallying hard in fact currently it's a key area of resistance a key area resistance is at the highest level to spend since August of last year also worth noting that after breaking the downtrend line on the weekly that the S&P500 also put in a bullish retest of that Breakout setting up from a technical perspective anyway could actually be a pretty good move for the markets so we'll see how that plays out of course it's kind of funny isn't it anyway Bitcoin has not been super closely correlated to the stock market so while the stocks are doing okay at the moment these last few days Bitcoin not so much in fact Bitcoin has been much more correlated with gold so cool we're correlating with store value when you know stocks are doing better anyway orange line here on the chart You'll See Is Gold and less correlated with stocks which is the blue line on the chart here pretty interesting"", ""but this is really what we're facing we're facing the prospect for a higher and higher likelihood unless the situation calms down dramatically and i don't know why it would calm down dramatically that if the fed doesn't do anything we're going to be in a much much worse inflationary situation and even if they do do something we're still probably going to be faced with very very stubborn inflation i do think there's a very strong possibility that in areas of the economy that are more discretionary that you do start seeing some stabilization of pricing pressures like we saw in used cars and trucks this month if you're spending all your money on food and rent and essentials you're probably going to wait to get that new car you're probably going to wait to get that new tv and so certainly there's a lot of pain to be felt in this entire economy if this continues so the next question is inevitably how do you emotionally and really logically and practically handle this market condition and all these uncertainties we've talked about short-term trades and short-term catalysts that we've covered in ziptraderu and on the channel but for people who are buying high conviction long-term plays either on the dip or have been buying it on previous steps how do you handle the emotional uncertainty market downtrends can be short they can be long but they're always very very painful emotionally and they always they always test you obviously inor you have been around for every single market downturn in the market's history but we do have the benefit of historical analysis and all the data being right at our fingertips and i can hammer again on the opportunities that are present in every bad fear-based market opportunities to buy things at deep deep discounts but that would just be me saying what i always say and what everybody says the biggest opportunity right now is your opportunity to learn how to handle yourself emotionally your opportunity to build emotional stamina and stability an opportunity for you to detach yourself from the immediate gratification that the market can often give you during an upcycle but that the market robs from you during a down cycle this market has not only been a downturning market but it's also been a big and dirty tease it gives you massive massive green days on its downturn and it makes you feel emotionally good about yourself like oh things are about to turn around but of course like we saw after yesterday's massive massive rally which was like one of the best days since june of 2020.""]"

So with the preferred stock you don't get any voting rights. So you know if you are a shareholder and you buy Coca-Cola, you buy any of these stocks and you have voting rights, but with preferred stock you don't have voting rights, but you do have access to those dividends. So if a company is going to cut the dividends typically the common stockholders are going to get to get dividends cut first. Preferred stockholders are going to get paid first. And a preferred stock is a hybrid between a stock and a bond debt of that company. So if you can kind of think of it like that, like it's a stock but it also pays a dividend.

And here is the other kicker too, is that just as an example, Alcoa is a company right now that if you buy their common stock, there is no dividend, so all you can hope to make money on is that appreciation."", ""and you own a hundred shares that means you own 10 of the company in the same example if you were to own only 10 shares that would mean you own one percent of the company's assets so companies basically sell stocks to raise money for their business operations there are a lot of companies out there that are not public they don't have you know stocks that are available on the stock market but the ones that you probably are familiar with those are public and they likely have shares trading in the General stock market so in a nutshell there's basically two ways that you guys can make money by buying and holding stocks the first is through dividend income and the second is through capital appreciation and on the next slides we're actually going to dive deeper into each of these two things so what are dividends basically Dividends are money that a company gives out to stockholders for holding the stock this is typically paid out monthly quarterly semi-annually or annually now the amount of money you're receiving is measured by the dividend yield which is essentially the dividend payment divided by the price so for example if a stock is worth twenty dollars and it pays out an annual dividend of one dollar that means that their dividend yield is going to be five percent you might be wondering why would companies actually want to you know give out dividend payments well it's going to be a percentage of corporate profits two qualified shareholders"", ""but why is it that some companies pay dividends and other companies don't if you look at say PepsiCo which I'll show you a little bit more in-depth but if we look at Pepsi they're paying almost about a 3% annual dividend of versus maybe if you look at Amazon or Facebook or Netflix they don't pay dividends so some companies pay these cash payments as dividends and all don't and the reason for this is because one's generally in the tech sector or companies that believe that they can reinvest this money back into themselves a little bit better generally won't pay out dividends but rather just take the profits and put it back into R&D or various other things that they can then grow their business faster and hopefully grow their stock faster then dividend stocks that are generally more well-established you'll see them as blue chip stocks companies that maybe have been around for quite some time but like to pay out to attract new investors with that dividend so let's take a look at PepsiCo just to give you an example here as to how you can actually take advantage of this and kind of go over some details here but what I'm using here is just a free resource you can use yahoo finance gives you a little bit of information about this company and a nice decent understanding and an overview of this company now you can also go on to the company's website look at their form 10k look at the various other investor relations page just about every company that's traded on the stock market is going to have an investor relations or investor resources page on their website and they're gonna have a lot of information on there so if you're ever considering investing into a company I just go on to their company's website and we're just going to google and type in investor relations for Pepsi or investor relations for coca-cola it'll bring you to the company's website and that's where you'll be able to find a lot of information about that actual company and their earnings and their different financials we're going to go over some of that later on in this video as well but let's take a look at Pepsi here to show you how you can actually take advantage of a dividend investing so for example here so Pepsi one hundred thirty two dollars per share for this particular stock that means if you have one hundred thirty two dollars of your money invested into Pepsi you could be earning about two point nine eight percent as a dividend payment from that company so about $3.82 in the course of a year as a cash payment to you paid out on a quarterly basis so split this $3.82 over four different quarters so every three months you'd be getting one-fourth of this $3.82 so this might not seem like a lot of money you say well gee $3.82 I can barely buy a cheeseburger""]"

basically been reset 2020 levels due to their business suffering at the hands of the macro economic environment see over the last few years Amazon has really focused on expanding capacity to increase their revenue and their profitability but of course with this inflation we've seen right now their costs are rising equally as quickly their costs of goods sold are rising operating expenses are rising and ultimately for Amazon earnings are suffering however many value investors is the betting that while they're going through some short-term pain at the moment this period of investment will ultimately set them up for long-term gain as this is a trend we've seen for decades with Amazon money's probably among others is quick to use Amazon as an example of exceptional Capital allocation and you can see from this chart thanks to my buddies Brad and David that Amazon will not stop investing into growing their company as you can see while Alibaba and Google and meta and apple are generating cash and they're just sticking it on the pile 10 cent and Amazon are the only two on the list that are taking their money plus some and putting it back into growth Avenues within the business now businesses don't just do this willy-nilly so a table like this really shows you the companies that genuinely believe that they have something worth investing in so that's the story with Amazon and now finally we get to our most bought stock in q1 of 2023 and it is Google"", ""and it simply just been beat up by a lot of short-term speculators as probably I would call them and people that don't have longer term time horizon so ret largely is what value investing is all about as I think Ben Graham put it you're not right because people think you're right you're not you're not right and investment because people agree with you or just agree with you you are right or wrong because your facts and your reasoning either correct or incorrect that's what an investing is all about so the next main question I want to cover is sumzero basically asked provide for a stock tip which you should never do and please don't ever ask me for them because you will you know that I will not answer that question but they basically said what are your three favorite stocks currently as long-term buyers and his answer was al ductless question and then so sumzero rephrased and they said so without specifically saying which your favorites and any stocks in particular what what US any stocks that you think of as long-term compounders or value plays which you think warrant closer examination due to the current situation and the world in other words to any great businesses come to mind which you think long-term investors could buy at a significant discount to intrinsic value which is the core of what we're trying to do here and / bribe bought up to stocks so he bought up one called carriage services and one called Live Nation and he says I've never owned either one carriage services is a funeral services business and the age of what is currently going on in the world there's no chance that their business as under Kline in fact the doom and gloom crowd should have piled into carriage services if they expected millions or more to to die from it's December peak however carriage is down 45 percent of which obviously makes no sense and then we have Live Nation they own Ticketmaster and pre what's currently going on enabled a concert to take place somewhere in the world every 15 minutes those three and a half thousand plus global concerts are now down to zero and they're likely to stay at zero for quite a while from its recent February peak peak Live Nation has been cut in half exactly the same as the business the first business carriage services which is very very stable and even a growing business right now so Live Nation has been cut in half I'm curiously waiting for Live Nation to release its q2 numbers in July the of revenues may approximate zero quite different from the numbers carriage services is likely to report in q2 carriage services will be quite profitable in q2 how much sense to the valuations of these two businesses make today and three months ago you've got one business that's doing perfectly fine probably even better than they were in the past one business that is suffering horrendously and they are both down the same amount compared to where they were a few months ago so great example of highly inefficient pricing in the market and potential places where you can take advantage again they're not stock tips but just a demonstration of how crazy and I guess illogical stocks can be priced just because of wider market forces rather than focusing on the actual underlying business which is what really drives long-term returns in pirai finishes this with I love Live Nation as a business and I believe humans will be back to attending sold out Taylor Swift concerts and close contact with each other in 2021 but even after a 50 percent drop Live Nation is not cheap enough for an excel phobic guy like me I still can't do the math on it on one hand maybe after a few reports of zero revenue quarters I will finally be able to buy it if there's a long term compounder its Live Nation so those are some thoughts those definitely aren't all the questions in this interview but that's a bit of a taste of the way that purbright is currently thinking through some of the things that are going on at the moment and they based basically asked them to finish the interview any final thoughts and Pabrai said this too shall pass humanity dodged this bullet very well and will make sure there are no future pandemics that create the mayhem this one did so interpret that as you wish I for one am pretty much already on board with all the stuff that that purpura has said I think that's over the long term if you're going to own a business for a very very long time 1 or 2 years don't really matter that much in terms of earnings""]"
