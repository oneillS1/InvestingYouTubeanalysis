have to pay attention at everyone's emotion they don't have to do this they don't it always takes work guys and that's any relationship I don't care if you're really sure it's just a friendly relationship or your significant other like you always got to be willing to put in the work the minute you stop putting in the work is the minute things start falling down a little bit by a little bit in the same way if you have a business and you also decide man I don't really want to put in the work I just want to go on vacation for the next month or two months can your business survive probably is it going to be hurt significantly or or at least a little bit I would say a little bit for sure impossibility of even significantly because you were absent all that time and who knows what the hell was happening with the business unless you've got some great manager to run the business while you're gone um let's think about stocks I mean if you you could just throw money at some stocks and hope it works out for the next ten years but I'm going to tell you the the one that's actually paying attention to stuff all those ten years and you know it's looking for new investments and opportunities and when they get a big gain over a couple years you know selling that game and put it in the next company that could potentially have their game I'm almost guarantee you they're going to probably do much better than the guy that you know just puts money in an index fund and throws it away for the next ten years or 15 years never looks at the money unless unless the stock picker is just so horrible that they can't pick stocks correctly so that's just kind of how it goes guys relationships financials set expectations up front don't don't just you know do whatever like make sure you got a plan there and that's just my feelings on this whole relationship and finances game guys so I hope this video helps you out if you're a male out there and I know there's going to be some guys that are just negative and you know had a bad relationship or got cheated on or saw this or saw that and you just always have a negative a negative view on that same way some people have it with the stock market like they just had you know something happened the stock market they saw someone lose money or they lost money in the stock and I screw that the stock markets a scam or they try to business once"", ""and they need to tighten Financial conditions that moved there I think I got to explain um something very very important to everybody watching this video right now in regards to uh stock brokerage right because I know a lot of you guys uh obviously have I mean I think almost every single person that watches my channel has money in a stock brokerage account like if you watch my videos and you don't have money invested in stocks like I'm just like shocked because I mean it doesn't even make sense unless you think I'm that entertaining that you would watch me even though you don't have money invest in stocks but nonetheless I think all you guys have money in a stock brokerage okay so the question is what happens if your stock brokerage went down for whatever reason right and I think that's a good question that a lot of people might be concerned with right after the whole svb situation it's like let's say you got you know a certain amount of money in there let's say you got a hundred thousand dollars in your portfolio you're like what happens if my stock brokerage went down"", ""so i already set a trade i'm going to show you that trade that i set on bitcoin make sure you

video is going to be a simple guide on stock market multiples things that you may have heard of like the p e ratio or the price to book ratio or many of the other ratios and metrics that exist out there in the stock market investing world this is going to be a video going through my top three uh simple easy to use metrics that are really useful to quickly screen out businesses that may look really cheap or really expensive just by some surface level numbers now none of these metrics really replace a full intrinsic value calculation and i have several videos on the channel on how to do that if you're interested in checking those out but these are very useful in order to screen different types of businesses some of these metrics work really well with certain types of companies and not so well with other types of companies so this video is going to be a simple how-to on how to use some of these key metrics and your own stock market investing now before we get into that we do have a sponsor for today's video and today's sponsor is hatch now i just actually checked through my email history and i've been a customer personally of hatch for coming up about two years now in about a week's time i will have been a customer of hatch for two years uh and i was paying for that service with my own money out of my own pocket from well before they were a sponsor of this channel and basically what hatch does is they allow you as a new zealander to buy shares in the us much cheaper than many of the alternatives like some of the big banks that offer overseas brokerage now uh initially when i switched across it really was just fees that uh sort of got me converted to hatch i was paying 90 us dollars a trade with one of the big banks i can now do that same trade for three us dollars in hatch but one of the things that they've also done throughout these two years is continue to improve the platform one of the things that they've launched just this month in march 2021 is kids accounts you can now set up an account for your kids buy shares for very very low fees as little as 50 cents per trade uh hold on to those stocks for an extended period of time and have no other fees throughout that entire holding period and really get compounding working for your children and get it kind of started up early we all know that the earlier you can start that compound in growth uh the better off you're going to be out the other side so if you're interested in checking out what hatch are doing or having a look at their kids accounts you will need to go to the link hatch dot a

read it in 10 minutes join our over 63 000 weekly readers and sign up for free yes for free use that link Down Below in the description now the second big reason why people lose money in crypto is that they buy and sell at exactly the wrong time every time most people only wait to buy at the highs when the Euphoria kicks in feels safe but the famous saying goes what is safe in investing is rarely profitable the best times to buy or when the markets are in the red when nobody wants to buy it as a scam it's all going to zero right when everyone's freaking out not when a coin is hitting a new all-time high or when we're seeing overbought technical indicators flashing right those are more dangerous Times by the risk is higher actually than buying when things are scary basically if you buy at that time you're just signing up to be a bag holder to be someone else's exit liquidity and to experience pain and loss look you need to be able to think clearly in this market to think unemotionally in this market look we all mess up sometimes we do been there right the rule is really simple though Buy Low sell high and be careful of extremes when we see Extremes in markets to not be overly emotional right don't be overly optimistic near the top and don't be overly scared near the bottom both are equally dangerous to your folio remember there are still people out there sidelined waiting and hoping for Bitcoin to drop down to ten thousand dollars that's Max Payne right now during this hated rally as crypto keeps going up and the biggest reason the vast majority of people in this market do not and will simply never ever ever make any freaking money fail to take profits not a single sell button"", ""like it's a great way to support the channel and again if you enjoy this kind of content but the big thing I also want to emphasize as well for those of you out there who are into the altcoin space and have seen some of the upward moves in Bitcoin are thinking hey is it time to go along with all coins I gotta be honest with you guys again even if this is the bottom of the bear market for Bitcoin right again the big thing that I want to emphasize is that we have not seen what is likely the lows in all coins because the low and all coins at least in terms of dominance not in dollar terms right because you want to be positioned in the place they're going to perform best right if you are going to be DCA or Trading long on any crypto place I would recommend it being Bitcoin for now and rather focusing on all coins in the coming future as we get towards better valuation ranges when dominance for Bitcoin ethereum usdt in usdc are a bit higher but now is the time to start doing the research on those plays getting involved and not only some free ways to be able to get exposure whether it be air drops or being able to participate within these projects and get some kind of rewards for it but also as well looking for the projects that you're going to want to buy or get exposure to when the time comes when the momentum is there when discounted valuations are really starting to highlight themselves and one of those plays that I'm really excited about is Creek Stevia now you guys have probably heard me talk about Greek cevia over the past two weeks you see me as a project we've actually talked about nearly almost a year ago back in early 2022 it's one of the projects on our radar but one of the play to earn or play-fi games within the cryptocurrency space that is one of the leading MMORPG games that's actually developing that's actually continuing to grow its community and has launched its really long-awaited beta here there was over 500 people playing the game during this period of time it was really awesome to see see the beta come alive for Creek Stevia and really again a big hats off to the team from the progress they've made in deploying this launch I know it's never easy there's of course some things along the way some challenges some bugs and fixes that'll come but what's really great about it is there's a lot of people simultaneously playing on the network there was more boss fights more features a lot of long-awaited things the team's been waiting to release so again a big hats off to the team on that if you guys are eager to see me play Greek cevia in the coming days to the next week we're planning to do a twitch event likely this upcoming Friday there will be some more details shared on the Twitter page so if you haven't already definitely follow them at creekscibia on Twitter you'll be able to

the exchanges that I am using uh when I am trading myself this is a continuation video of my previous video 100 per day on buy bit you can go and check that video link down below if you haven't seen that go check it out but let's dive straight into these strategies I'm gonna show you to do so it's very important first of all that you know that this video is not a financial advice it's all about just providing some strategies that I'm using and it's up to you if you want to use them or not to get started you need to deposit funds either in the form of Fiat or crypto over to buy bit for this you can click my link in the description to buy bits if you click my link you can get actually up to 30 thousand dollars in deposit bonus now that you have a buy bit account and that you have up to

Bitcoin chart but this doesn't mean that you cannot use other altcoins personally I'm gonna use coin market cap today because it allows us to check many different cryptocurrencies and analyze them and also sort them by the highest gains and losses in the past 24 hours to see which tokens are trending you can even search new tokens for a category we can consider using this method for checking an altcoin trending tokens are always good"", ""[Music] before we head for all-time highs there is a disclaimer i need to supply financial advice is well and good but if you're looking for it here you're in the wrong neighborhood i'm not a financial advisor and i don't even have an fca degree when it comes to educational crypto content however i have a triple phd if this is your first run in with the bureau my name is guy and i am a crypto superhero i keep no coiners and moon boys at bay with the highest quality crypto content you'll find on youtube today crypto news crypto reviews and crypto market moves are just a few of the topics in my tool belt if you want to join me in my crypto quest subscribing to the channel and pinging that notification bell is the way to do it best note that i've left timestamps in the video timeline that you can use to get around if you're feeling stretched for time of course i'd appreciate it if you watch the whole way through because it will help this video get even more views forget your fud and fomo let's dive into the dip and all the things you need to know the first step to mastering the dip is understanding what it actually is in cryptocurrency the dip is defined as a sudden and sustained drop in price this is a vague definition because whether or not a cryptocurrency is dipping really depends on its general volatility during a bull run like the one we're in now it is normal for bitcoin's price to go up or down by five percent per day or go up or down by 10 or more on a weekly basis for all coins it's normal for their prices to change by more than 10 per day and they can easily gain or lose more than 20 of their value each week if this is the price action you see this means the crypto market is trading sideways and is in a no trend scenario in other words prices aren't really going up or down now if bitcoin suddenly drops by more than five percent in a day or an altcoin drops by more than 10 in a day this could mean a dip is beginning normally you'll know within a few days whether it is an actual dip or just extra market volatility if it is a dip this can signal one of two things a temporary correction in a bull market or a crash that results in a bear market naturally people who are bullish on cryptocurrency will generally adopt the correction narrative whereas those who are bearish on crypto will insist that it will crash down to zero the easiest way to check this for yourself is to pop open the price chart of the cryptocurrency you're looking at on coin market cap or coin gecko set the time frame to one year and try and spot a long term price trend now if you see that the price has been consistently trending up over the last year this dip is probably a temporary correction if it looks like the price is trending down or has reversed from an uptrend to a downtrend in recent months this dip could be the beginning of a long-term crash as you can see bitcoin's recent dip was nothing more than a temporary correction on a longer term uptrend bitcoin has had around four major corrections so far since the bull run began last spring and all of them have been within the 30 range to put things into context corrections in bitcoin's previous bull runs were usually over 50 the reason why they're not as extreme this time around is probably because institutional investors and experienced retail investors have been buying the dip bitcoin's volatility has also been declining over time as adoption increases and the mass adoption we've seen just over the last few months means it's very unlikely that bitcoin will be crashing anytime soon now you can learn all about that by watching my recent video about coingecko's quarterly crypto report link is hanging up there in the top right so now that you know what the dip is and how to spot it the next step is to figure out what could be causing it this is important to know if you're trying to buy the dip because looking at the price charts alone might not give you enough context to make the right call for example if one of your favorite coins is crashing because it's turned out to be a scam no amount of technical analysis is going to help you buy that dip because it's just going to keep dipping by contrast if ethereum suddenly drops because there's news that miners are going to try and disrupt the network in protest of eip 1559 then clearly this will require a more elaborate buy-the-dip strategy the problem with identifying causes in crypto is that it's very rare that you can definitively point to a single factor usually there are multiple factors causing a dip and each of these often cause overlapping chains of events that can turn into a vicious feedback loop let's use bitcoin's recent dip as an example of what i mean by this as far as i can tell the dip in mid-april was caused by a barrage of bad news for starters on april the 15th turkey announced it would be banning cryptocurrency payments now this probably spooked quite a few new investors who might have gotten the impression from certain news outlets that this is the beginning of some larger movement by governments to ban cryptocurrency since cryptocurrency investors are located around the world not all of them got this news at the same time within about 24 hours all the newbies knew what was up and their panic selling was in full force the sudden drop in price this course resulted in reckless traders using too much leverage getting liquidated on futures exchanges in plain english the btc these traders used as collateral to borrow from exchanges to execute these risky trades was automatically sold onto the open market this is what caused that huge wick you see on the bottom of the big red candle on the bitcoin chart for april the 17th in this case the wick was created by all the traders who had set buy orders for btc in that price range these orders were filled by all the btc being sold from over-leveraged traders prices stabilized for a couple of days and then dropped again when the news came out that the current u.s administration was looking to increase corporate and capital gains taxes an increased corporate tax would mean less profit and less profit translates to lower stock prices for all the affected companies an increased capital gains tax would mean that any wealthy investors who have already cashed out some of their gains this year will probably need to sell more assets to pay for the taxes on those gains the combined effect of both factors led to a dip in both the stock market and the cryptocurrency market where it again triggered liquidations from over-leveraged traders though to a lesser degree now i have to stress that this is a simplified explanation of the causes and chains of events behind the recent dip and there were probably way more moving parts at play in the background now if you want to get a closer look at why bitcoin pumps and dumps you can watch my video about that by using the link in the top right now that you know what the dip is how to spot it and all the factors that cause it the next step is to understand how this relates to altcoin dips as many of you already know all coins are highly correlated to bitcoin now this is important to remember during dips because no amount of bullish news can save your altcoin if bitcoin is in free fall sometimes there are exceptions to this rule but i have yet to see a single altcoin that has sustained its price across multiple bitcoin dips not even stable coins more importantly remember that whenever bitcoin dips altcoins will usually dip harder this is because in the context of cryptocurrency bitcoin is seen as the safe haven and altcoins are seen as risky investments you can track how money is moving between bitcoin and altcoins using the bitcoin dominance chart as you can see bitcoin dominance spiked during the recent dip however as with price you can see that the longer term trend is towards lower bitcoin dominance aka more money moving into altcoins this means that whenever bitcoin dips and decimates all coins the profits you'll get from buying the dip will be even larger for all coins this is because they will rebound much more aggressively than bitcoin once it finishes dipping and btc dominance returns to its downtrend case in point during the relief rally last weekend bitcoin went up by about seven percent whereas many altcoins went up by 15 or more pro tip don't be discouraged if your altcoin doesn't pump right away after the market is done dipping if you can see that your altcoin has been in a visible uptrend on the one year time frame it's probably a matter of time before that pump comes your way you can get a sense of when that pump might happen and how high it could take your favorite alt by using technical analysis now technical analysis is much easier to do than you think and this cryptochamp happens to have a beginner's guide in my introvid 2 ta now that you know what the dip is how to spot it and all the factors that cause it and how it impacts the altcoin market the last step is to measure how low the dip could go again a lot of this will depend on the factors that are causing the dip and there is no way of knowing for sure where the bottom of the dip actually is however there are no shortage of tools you can use to estimate how deep a dip could get and all of these can be found on the trading terminals of your favorite cryptocurrency exchanges if the entire crypto market is dipping then your main area of focus should be the btc usd chart even if you don't hold any btc this is because of that bitcoin altcoin relationship i mentioned moments ago start by going full screen removing all the indicators and setting the time frame to weekly this will give you some perspective about what could happen in the market in the medium term the first thing to look for is any price zones that could serve as support if the price were to fall any further in this case it's quite clear that the 49k range is a strong zone of price support for btc next enable the ema indicator this stands for exponential moving average and it helps identify any other zones that could serve as support that aren't immediately apparent in this case the ema suggests that if btc were to drop again the next zone of support would be around 42k this means that if you wanted to buy that dip you'd be trying to buy somewhere around that 42k range remember that the price could drop slightly below this level because of things like liquidations if this dip were to happen it would correspond to a 20 drop you can measure this using the ruler icon in the trading view tab of the trading terminal on the binance exchange full tutorial to use this exchange is in the top right by the way because altcoin losses can be almost twice as big as bitcoin losses during a dip this would translate to a 30 to 40 percent dip for your altcoin holdings so now that you know what the bearish scenario is in the medium term you can get a better sense of what to expect in the short term by using the daily time frame the daily time frame typically offers the best vantage point for buying the dip as with the weekly time frame the first thing to look for is visible signs of support the way to spot these zones of support is by looking at where prices have clustered in the past and this is often much easier to do on the daily time frame as you can see here the 49k range is showing itself as a strong zone of support and the next level below that seems to be around 46 to 47 k"", ""are you getting constantly wrecked by the crypto market if you are it might be because you've been making decisions based on bad crypto advice so today i'm going to tell you about some of the worst crypto advice you can get and what you should consider doing instead [Music] before i hit you with the facts there's a misconception i need to whack if you came here looking for financial advice i'm afraid you won't find any of that that's because entertainment and education are the only things i pack please contact a financial advisor if money is what you're trying to attract now if this is the first time you come by my name is guy and this channel is where crypto fudd comes to die that's because i create high quality crypto content that explains the who what when and why coins tokens news and reviews are just a few of the topics i supply so if this is the kind of content that gets you high subscribing to the channel and pinging that notification bell is the correct reply if you're trying to beat the clock you can use the timestamps below to hop just remember that watching until the end will help this video pop now that you know the plot let's look at the crappy crypto advice that's keeping you in a knot the first piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is a timeless classic and that's that you should buy a crypto when it's at or near its all-time high this tends to happen because you've either been led to believe that this crypto will continue to pump or because prices keep pumping while you watch and you start to feel the fomo and of course when you buy the price starts to crash and you end up at a 30 to 50 percent loss within days sometimes the loss is enough for you to sell especially if another crypto catches your eye here's what you can do instead start by assuming that if you're hearing about a crypto because it's pumping then you're already late to the game and are therefore at a high risk of getting wrecked next pop open that kryptos price on coin market cap or coin gecko set the time frame to maximum and see whether the current pump is sustainable or not if you're not sure then pull up the charts for that crypto on your favorite crypto exchange set the chart to daily and slap on the bollinger band indicator if prices are popping out the top then you're too late now you can learn more about how to spot the top using the link in the description the second piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a certain cryptocurrency because its price tag is low and that means it's going to make you rich if it gets as big as bitcoin oddly enough the cryptocurrencies that fall into this category tend to have the most militant communities and chances are that they're the ones who gave you this advice and of course when you buy the price starts to crash and it's only when your portfolio is down 50 that you realize the price tag doesn't matter so here's what you can do instead start by ignoring the price tag of cryptocurrency and focus instead on its market cap this is because it's the market cap that ultimately determines how much a crypto can pump or dump don't forget that it goes both ways next ask yourself how large this cryptocurrency's market cap could realistically grow i.e how much investment this cryptocurrency could realistically see and by when spoiler it's not going to have a bigger market cap than bitcoin or ethereum regardless of what the fanboys say if you're not sure how big a crypto will grow then check out the other crypto projects in its category and see how it stacks up against its competition primarily when it comes to social engagement and monthly active users if applicable you can learn more about crypto categories using the link in the description the third piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a certain cryptocurrency because it's being shield by someone popular such as a musician politician or an electric car company ceo what makes this advice so bad is that it can come with the illusion of legitimacy particularly when someone tells you about this crypto before it pumps and you manage to get in early eventually however the prices start to crash and maybe you double down and buy the dip once or twice before you realize that you should have gotten out a long time ago as prices approach zero here's what you can do instead start by being aware that celebrity promotion is a huge red flag since quality crypto projects do not require any marketing especially not the kind of marketing that explicitly targets inexperienced retail investors next check to see whether the crypto project being pushed actually has potential this includes stuff like a clear use case that creates demand a vesting and inflation schedule that doesn't introduce too much supply and a unique design that sets it aside from its competitors most of this information can be found in a crypto project's white paper and you can learn how to read those using the link in the description the fourth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a cryptocurrency just because it was mentioned by a popular youtuber similarly to buying a crypto because it's pumping this advice tends to be given shortly after a youtuber posts a video about the crypto project which is literally the worst time to buy and of course when you buy there is a chance others will see it as an opportunity to take profits and sell and then you blame the youtuber for your losses even though they told you time and time again that their videos are not financial advice and crypto trading bots automatically buy and sell the cryptos they're talking about when a video is posted here's what you can do instead start by realizing that you should only be using crypto youtube videos as part of your own research and remembering that youtubers don't always get everything right next check to see if the youtuber in question is getting paid to talk about certain crypto projects or holds the coin or token they're talking about as part of their personal portfolio as most of you will already know i do not do paid videos i only talk about crypto projects i personally believe in and always tell you whether the crypto i'll be talking about is part of my personal crypto portfolio at the start of every video you can see how my crypto portfolio performed in 2021 by using the link in the description and you can find out what my crypto portfolio looks like now by subscribing to my weekly newsletter also in the description the fifth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to trust the stuff you read on social media about a crypto project if you're a regular user of twitter or reddit you've probably seen no shortage of posts that make you feel fomo about certain crypto projects and make you feel fud about others sometimes these posts can be very convincing and that causes you to buy or sell a crypto at the wrong time resulting in massive losses or missed gains here's what you can do instead start by being aware that a lot of the people who aggressively spread fomo and fud on social media are either being paid or have invested so much time and money into a crypto project that their bias has gotten the best of them next do your own research to determine whether what they're saying is true or false pro tip if the information they're giving isn't publicly available or requires talking directly with a member of the team to confirm you're probably dealing with a coin you can find out what other characteristics coins tend to have by watching my video about that using the link in the description the sixth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to keep all your cryptocurrency on a custodial platform such as a cryptocurrency exchange or a crypto savings app proponents of this approach push the idea that these platforms are just as safe as self-custody and you might as well earn some interest on your idle coins and tokens when you're not trading right""]"

first acknowledge that lifestyle inflation is unavoidable it's going to happen to all of us and it's really important to work with it rather than just not acknowledge that it exists or think it doesn't apply to us and the easiest way to begin working with this is by paying yourself first every single paycheck before you spend any amount of money put a set amount aside that you do not touch under any circumstances for any reason whatsoever just pretend that that money doesn't even exist before it even hits your account and that way there's no chance of you ever spending it i personally recommend setting aside at least 15 to 20 of your monthly paycheck each and every month if you're able to save more than that then by all means that that will just make me even happier but just get in the habit of starting to do this consistently to prevent yourself from spending any excess money that you might have ramsay get down now when it comes to that another concern i see is that a lot of the millennials featured in these videos do not have any sort of emergency fund at all in fact sometimes it seems as though their only emergency fund is just a credit card which like i said ends up costing you significantly more than you ever need to spend if you don't have the money to pay it off immediately now for those that don't know an emergency fund is basically money you set aside to only be used in the event of an emergency where you otherwise have no other option to turn to ideally the amount in this emergency fund should be equal to three to six months worth of your living expenses and kept easily accessible for emergencies and remember when it comes to this an emergency fund is not money that you set aside just to frivolously spend as you want to it's not money that you set aside to go and invest with it's just money that you have at your disposal in case she hits the fan and you need something on short notice like if you lose a job you need to pay rent you need to pay for food your car breaks down or anything like this you got your money there already and the reason you shouldn't be investing this money is because on short notice your investments might be falling at a time where maybe you need it the most like for instance let's say a recession happens and stocks drop 30 in price and then all of a sudden you lose your job and you need your emergency funds so you start selling off your stocks after they've already dropped 30 in price when chances are you shouldn't really be selling those stocks instead you should always aim to keep your emergency fund in a high interest savings account where it's safe and where you're guaranteed to get a return on your money even if that just means you're keeping pace with inflation you could go and use ally bank which pays you 1.9 percent in interest you can go and use wealthfront which pays you 2.32 in interest or a myriad of other options out there that you have to choose from just do me one favor and make sure you get at least 1.9 in interest on a high interest savings account so that that way you can make the biggest use of your money now given all of those previous mistakes here's a bit of a backwards mistake that some people just tend to fall into because they end up too careful with money and from that they don't end up getting a credit card it's okay to err on the side of caution and make sure you don't go into debt and only spend money that you have available in your account that is all good"", ""let's say right before retirement and finally from all the advice in this video this is the one that i feel like is the most important you should use your 20s as a time that you could just work your ass off save as much money as you can and use all of that to get ahead now is the time to absolutely pursue any career aspirations you might have to work harder than you ever thought was possible and to save more money than you ever thought was imaginable because trust me as someone who did that throughout their entire 20s i'm 29 years old now and i've pretty much set myself up to never have to worry about this stuff ever again for the rest of my life because of what i did between the ages of 18 and basically now and while sure it's okay to relax and have fun every now and then just stay disciplined because the work that you put in right now and the money you save right now could be enough to carry you forward throughout the rest of your life because i'll tell you from my experience it just becomes more difficult as you get older you're probably not going to have as much energy as you did back when you were 18 you're probably just going to start needing maybe just a little bit more sleep and you're going to start wanting to try new and better things and having that money invested in the bank is going to give you the flexibility to pursue the things you really want to pursue while getting the heavy lifting out of the way early on and also during all of that it's just as equally as important to focus on now starting to increase your income at the exact same time as you're focusing on decreasing your expenses and saving as much money as possible and sometimes people just can't save enough money and it's not a fault of budgeting or a lack of just frivolously spending a lot of times these people just don't make enough money and instead they need to focus on increasing their income rather than trying to scrimp and save as much as they possibly can while not earning a lot that's why beyond a certain point it's worth it to start switching jobs if that means you could start making a little bit more money or maybe learn new skills so that you could start increasing your income and working towards something that's potentially a little bit more financially ambitious and when it comes to investing just keep it simple a broad index fund is just one of the easiest simplest and safest ways to invest your money when you hold it long term it's really as easy as just buying a target date retirement fund or just one simple broad index fund continuing to buy more each month and just doing that over and over again or it could also be as simple as spending an hour a day on bigger pockets in youtube just learning how to invest in real estate and then going on weekends to check out open houses and then by the time you have your down payment ready you'll be able to invest in real estate and learn exactly how it's done and if there's any piece of millennial money investing advice that i highly recommend it's to really focus on cutting down your living expenses as much as you possibly can while you're young arguably housing is one of the biggest recurring monthly expenses that you're going to have so figuring out how to reduce this while you're young is going to have the biggest impact going forward long term"", ""when you least expect it a natural disaster could completely tear apart your home or an illness could throw all of your plans out the window now that's not to say that you should live your life around getting bit by a shark after your car breaks down while you were driving back from the hospital to treat a rare illness after getting fired but it is to say that you should have a plan in place just in case one of those or two of them were to happen at the same time in this case save enough on the side to make sure that if you lose your job you'll be okay for the next three to six months make sure you have the proper home insurance to make sure you're covered in the event of a disaster go and get regular checkups so that if something were to happen at least to catch it early and spend money maintaining your cars so that it'll last another 100 000 miles all of these things can proactively help you in the long run so that that way you're financially prepared for anything that comes your way including Carol Baskin and finally number nine is not having a plan think of it this way when you go on a road trip you know your final destination and you have a map that's showing you exactly how to get there but when it comes to someone's life or finances most people just wing it and hope that eventually they end up where they want to be unfortunately though life never really works that way and unless you have a plan you're probably not going to achieve it this means figuring out what you want to be doing how much money you'll realistically need to save and where your priorities are I think most people would be shocked to learn that they don't need the tens of millions of dollars to live the life they think they want and they haven't come to terms with the fact that they don't want to run a multi-billion dollar Global Empire just carefully think about exactly what you want to do throughout the day and how much that's realistically going to cost then work backwards to figure out exactly how you can achieve that for example a waterfront home in Florida could be a million dollars Home Furnishings could be another fifty thousand dollars a used Ferrari could be a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and six thousand dollars a year in maintenance going out to restaurants is another two thousand dollars a month maybe spend two thousand dollars a month on hobbies and another two thousand dollars a month on miscellaneous stuff all in you would be able to buy that lifestyle for 1.2 million dollars in one time costs and one million nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars invested though even though that might seem like a lot of money you could get there by investing twenty four thousand dollars a year at an eight percent return over the next 30 Years essentially that's just you maxing out your 401K throughout your entire career and voila you got that retirement now for the rest of your life so if you haven't already done the math add it up because I promise you're probably not going to get there unless you know exactly where the destination is so with that said you guys thank

millionaires have been created by investing in real estate I had no idea it was that large of a number but that is the percentage of people that became millionaires by investing in real estate most people are becoming millionaires as real estate investors it's not by starting a business it's not by launching an app or getting involved in cryptocurrency I'm sure some people did become millionaires doing that but most people from plain old real estate that is how they became a millionaire now there are a number of obvious reasons why real estate is such a good investment number one there are huge tax advantages associated with investing in real estate and write offs that you're not going to find with other investments out there if you compare real estate investing to investing in bonds or investing in the stock market it is not a fair playing field real estate investors have access to a lot more write offs and a lot more tax advantages than you're going to see as a stock or bond investor second of all real-estate allows you to have leverage with your investment and that essentially means you're in control of a much larger asset for a smaller amount of money and when you have leverage like that if that asset in and of itself increases in value you know you're going to be having a proportionately larger gain because you only have a small amount of money involved in that property so just to give you guys a rough example here let's say you have a property worth $200,000"", ""but if you go and advertise or solicit that house to somebody else then that's not allowed without a real estate license and that's a bit iffy you're also going to need to establish proof that you had the intention and means to purchase the property yourself not that you just drove around an area got a home under contract and then pitched it to some random people on craigslist if this is done honestly and ethically then i don't have any problems with it as long as it follows the law but i will say this even though you can make money wholesaling real estate i rarely ever see someone successful long-term wholesaling real estate and most people who i see making money wholesaling real estate are just teaching other people how to wholesale real estate so i'm gonna go ahead and rate this one a four out of ten it's really good that he's getting people thinking of ways to make money but practically and logistically this is a very difficult one to do okay"", ""Kevon with meet kevin calm coming to you with a quick tip people always wonder how do you amass real estate we have to collect 20 to 25 percent down every time you want to go buy a property most people think you need 20% down to buy a house and go to buy an investment property you need 25% down what's a pro tip buy property with minimum down and then move after a year and keep the first property so now you're only saving 3 to 5 percent every year this doesn't work well for people with families for people obviously settled into place because they're moving all the time however if you're a young family capable of moving every 1 to 3 years it makes a lot of sense to put 5% down and take advantage of low interest rates move every 2 to 3 years now keep in mind all that means is you have to save five percents if you go to buy a $500,000 house you've got to put aside $25,000 before you can buy the next one it's a lot of saving to do so that's why it may take two or three years but theoretically you can do it as quickly as every year you're supposed to live in an owner-occupied property for at least one year before you move out of it now the other caveat is you actually have to qualify for all of these properties however once you have your first rental property you get to start to claim the benefit is once you have your first rental property in the bag you get to start declaring that income really helps to qualify especially if you have a cash flowing property well that's where the other issue comes in sometimes if you continue put minimum down payments down the cash flow might not be that great have a long-term strategy and as rents go up it'll be a lot more possible keep this in mind you don't have to be a first-time homebuyer to get a 5% down look anybody who's going to owner occupier property can put 5% down there are loan limits in certain areas talk to your lender 5% down is a possibility for most people now generally it's not possible on high-end see because the minimum down payment requirements usually go up to ten percent if you're going to live there that's often times up to 1.5 million in our area you can get by with ten percent down so if you haven't bought a house yet thinking of buying a house don't think you need 20 percent the very first step to acquiring real estate wealth is getting into your first property save that 5% get in if you don't have your first property yet there are even programs so you can take advantage of that will help you get your first property by covering some of your down payment costs that's huge once you start amassing real estate it also becomes easier to leverage against the properties you already own to buy future rental properties and that's really where you can extrapolate your wealth the key secret to all of this is don't sell your first property you got to keep it so remember don't wait to buy real

5,4,387,4_bank_banks_money_dollar,"['bank', 'banks', 'money', 'dollar', 'know', 'world', 'government', 'going', 'digital', 'financial']","[""that's another problem here's the thing is most of you know anytime you make a deposit within a bank you're protected by what's called FDIC insurance which protects up to the first two hundred and fifty thousand dollars you have deposited in the event of a bank failure this was created after the bank runs the 1920s Great Depression as a way to incentivize people to re-trust the banking system and it largely worked since then FDIC insurance has continued to evolve for any Bank who wants to legally operate in the United States and the good news is that it's a fairly efficient system in fact their website says that you could get access to your money within a few days after the bank's closing however in this case the bad news is that as Genevieve from grit Capital points out only two point seven percent of silicon Valley's Bank deposits are less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars meaning ninety seven point three percent of their money is not FDIC insured and it's not clear exactly what's going to happen to all of that money now typically in cases where deposits exceed the FDIC limit losses are recovered in a bankruptcy court when assets are sold off to pay their creditors but his bank rate explains that process could take several years to complete and more than likely their customers are not going to receive all of their money back from what they started with although to me that isn't even the worst of it instead it's just how far this is about to reach over the coming few days and weeks and I have a feeling this is really only the tip of the iceberg for those in aware Silicon Valley Bank isn't just a bank for the average person they're the bank for a significant portion of venture-backed companies throughout the United States and when those businesses keep a significant portion or even all of their money with one institution they could be completely wiped out overnight the reality is many of these institutions have raised millions or even tens of millions of dollars with the expectation that that's going to be enough to last them throughout these next few years those businesses have carefully saved money kept it liquid for emergencies and have spent it wisely only to have it reduced to 250 000 overnight from that perspective this is going to be crippling to every single business that banks with Silicon Valley Bank especially since they currently hold more than 342 billion dollars worth of customer funds now realistically a startup is not going to lose all their money with the bank and it's not like every dollar over 250 000 is suddenly worth zero but it could take years to recover whatever's left and whether or not the company has enough money to stay afloat in the meantime is completely up in the air I would venture to say that most of them cannot just consider that everything from payroll company expenditures and all of their overheads could be held in One bank and 250 000 could be a drop in the buck pocket for a company who had saved significantly more to make it through a time of slower growth there's really no way out of this with the exception of trying to raise cash as desperately as possible in a panic at a discount downsizing significantly or going under which is something that no one thought would happen just a week ago so that then of course begs the question could the same thing happen to your bank the answer is it's possible but it's unlikely the issue with Silicon Valley Bank was that they were in a niche market servicing startups and were funded by Venture Capital which was drying up that meant that very little money was flowing in a lot of money was flowing out and the majority of the bank's Capital was locked away in bonds for the next four years at a low interest rate that had declined in value essentially this meant that if the bank were to wait long enough they would have enough cash on hand and potentially absorb the short-term losses but when everyone begins withdrawing all of their money all at the exact same time the bank is left with no other choice other than to shut down now sure in essence every every single Bank operates this way and is only required to keep 10 percent of customer funds on hand at all time to process withdrawals but in Silicon Valley Bank's case they went all in on the bond market at the worst possible time at the very Peak"", ""and they quickly became a prominent lender throughout Silicon Valley while catering almost exclusively to venture capital essentially this became the startups Bank where CEOs and businesses would go for funding and for the last several decades that worked out incredibly well until recently and you're going to want to follow along in 2020 when interest rates were reduced to zero and stimulus measures were put in place both Banks and people were flush with cash and almost all of that funneled back into the banking system which is where things began to go wrong see Banks currently operate on what's called fractional Reserve banking this means that banks are required to keep at least 10 percent of their customers money available at all times for withdrawals just imagine it like this you give me your thousand dollars to hold on to for safe keeping but I could turn around to give 900 of that to somebody else who could give 810 to somebody else who could give 729 dollars to somebody else under this situation Banks hope that enough people give them 1000 dollar deposits so that when the first person wants their money back they'll have enough cash on hand to process that withdrawal the benefit to doing this is that this allows their customers access to a much larger pool of money and they're able to earn interest on their deposits but that also relies on everyone having faith that the system works and not all pulling their money out at the exact same time which has started to happen now to be fair in most cases Banks aren't lending to other Banks who lend to other Banks who lend to other Banks instead Banks often take your money loan out a portion of it and invest the rest in really really safe and stable Investments like U.S treasuries this ensures that as long as those treasuries are held to maturity the bank gets near the guaranteed rate of return customers could be made whole and everyone wins except in this case and here's why in 2021 and early 2022 Silicon Valley bank took roughly a hundred billion dollars and invested that into government-backed bonds with a significant portion of that locked away for three to four years at an interest rate of just one point seven nine percent essentially this meant that Silicon Valley bank took a massive bet that the Federal Reserve was not going to raise interest rates as fast as they did and when they turned out to be wrong that put them in a very dangerous position see bonds like this are valued based on their yield and in this case Silicon Valley Bank was on the wrong side of the transaction to lose a lot of money just imagine it like this as an example Silicon Valley bank took a hundred dollars and bought a two percent interest rate for four years as long as they could hold it for the full four years they'll receive a hundred and eight dollars and 24 cents back and be paid in full no problem whatsoever but what would happen if interest rates suddenly increased right after you made your investment and all of a sudden you could buy that exact same 100 at a seven percent return and make 131 dollars over this exact same four years well in that case sure hundred dollar two percent Bond would have to decline to 77 is to be worth what you could buy at today's prices and if you can't afford to hold out for the full four years to get your money back you're going to be forced to take a loss and that's what's starting to happen and normally Banks would have enough Capital coming in from a variety of sources to cover customer withdrawals but in this case Silicon Valley Bank's customer base or mainly technology companies which have seen significantly less funding and that means that their companies are forced to take more money out of the bank to pay for their own expenses essentially Silicon Valley Banks severely misjudged the size and pace of the federal reserve's rate hikes while assuming that the Venture Capital Market would continue to stay strong that left them in a situation where they locked too much of their money away in one specific asset that yielded too low of a return and that occurred at the exact same time their customers began withdrawing more money than they anticipated this of course is where the dominoes begin to fall on Wednesday March 8th"", ""and then there is the Bank of international settlements which was founded back in 1930 by the creators of the Federal Reserve this was done to ensure that their reign and their control of monetary policy globally was persistent across the world and as the name implies the bis Bank of international settlements it's the central bank for central banks decisions made at the IMF the ECB the fed the WF the Boe they all run through the bank of international settlements this is the banks piggy bank where huge amounts of wealth and power are being funneled to the wealthiest people on this planet this is the agency where shadowy banking families and shadowy banking cartels remain in control of the world's money safely managing foreign exchange reserves from their Tower up on high this is the banking institution's biggest proponent by the way as well of the implementation of Central Bank digital currencies the newest and greatest Financial threat to humanity which is being cooked up by globalists and we fully programmable digital money with scary implications the outline is clear create more and more debt so the banking cartels can print more and more money this is all part of how fractional Reserve banking works is how this Fiat system works one of the most valuable Tools in A bank's Arsenal is his ability to steal money from a nation without that Nation even knowing that's inflation that's debt and it's done by compounding debt on top of debt on top of debt most economies are ruled by debt since all the money of course is being printed out of thin air the debt ends up being more just numbers on paper than actual physical ownership of tangible goods or services and then of course the fractional Reserve banking system means that only some of the money that exists in all all of the bank accounts is actually backed by physical cash that can actually be withdrawn something like a measly 10 percent in the USA thus Banks take the other 90 of your money and lend it out to anyone that they deem worthy meaning that every dollar in your bank account is not actually your money it becomes the bank's money of course it's all the bank's money anyway at the end of the day isn't it the Fiat system is a scam it's a fugazi it's a system designed to enslave everyone via debt and to impoverish everyone via inflation and all the while this criminal banking cartel manipulates the supply of money to their advantage massively enriching themselves and impoverishing everyone else Fiat money only has value because we give it value it's actually backed by nothing most people don't even realize this there's no gold backing up the dollar there's no resources backing up the dollar just a trust me bro from the government it's insanity but this era of USD Fiat dominance could be coming to an end and when it does we probably have just three choices of what comes next the first first is cbdc Central Bank digital currencies such a truly orwellian evolution of modern Fiat and criminal banking practices combined with technological totalitarianism option two the bricks money this is a proposal by the brics group Brazil Russia India China South Africa other members coming on board basically to have a commodity-backed currency backed by things like gold silver oil as well as potentially member State Fiat kind of ish a return to hard money if you will that would be a bit of a shock to the financial system if it actually grows into a global status remains to be seen but still government issued money an option three of course Bitcoin Bitcoin is the only currency of freedom in the world right now it's the only free market economic money all the other options are just extensions of failed Central banking system policies all benefits the banks we deserve a free currency not a currency controlled by monetary mechanisms that are used as Financial weapons Bitcoin is the only truly free

tell you the text alignment you got your top your middle and your bottom I want to be using let's say I always use my supports at the bottom as it's a base and what I like to do is you can either make the writing move to the left to the center or to the right of the actual trend line"", ""but what do they actually mean well these candlesticks are nothing more than a representation of price moving over a certain period of time a daily chart would be a representation of a full day of price if this was a one-hour chart and not a daily chart it would be a representation of one day of price and what they need to be recognized as is with a green candle the green candle normally represents an update meaning that this area here is the open the bottom of the body is the open this here is the low it is the low point of the pot of the candle the bottom of that wick is the low point of this 24-hour period represented by our green candle this high point is the high of this 24-hour period and this is the close of that candle so if this candle would have started at 5:00 p.m. and then ended at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time then this is exactly what it would look like if we had an open here price moved down from our open to our low price then moved back up to our high and then price came back down and finally closed right here that is exactly what these candlesticks mean that's a great presentation of a green candlestick or a positive day in price if you're looking at a daily chart a negative day is shown by this red candle here so on this red candle we have a very similar setup except instead of the bottom of the body being to open on a red candle the top of the body is the open the top of this wick is still the high of this candle the bottom wick is still the low of this candle and the bottom of the body is the close of this candle so in the representation of this candle what we would have seen if we were watching this on a daily chart is this candle would have opened here it then went to pushed up to the high and then pushed all the way down to the low and then eventually pushed back up to close that 24-hour period right there at the bottom of this red candle so that's how you see a candlestick and that's how that's how you break down the anatomy of each and every one of these candlesticks it represents a certain amount of time depending on the time period your own everything would be exactly the same if this was one hour instead of daily this was one hour then that would still be the exact same anatomy of a candlestick so now that we've broken debt that down a little bit let's head down to a different white screen and take a look at the four green candles we were looking at right at the intro of the video so now can you spot the similarities of any of these right now what I'm gonna do is go ahead and tell you the similarity and teach you the candlestick pattern that I never hear talked about here on YouTube and that I think is one of the most accurate candlestick patterns you can use for a buying trade and that is each one of these candles closes in the top 95% of the candle each one of these candles has either a tiny wick on it or no wick on the top at all and with these being green candles what that means is that the end of whatever time period let's just say we're still on the daily for simplicity at the end whatever time period we are looking at this candle closed nearly at its high at the highest point that the participants of the market pushed this candle it dropped barely any which means there was not many sellers at the end of this candle at the end of this period if we have little to no wicks on the top of these candles that means there were no sellers at the end of this period so that gives us a good representation that we could possibly see a market head higher from a candlestick like this and the way I defined this whenever I'm trading on a 4-hour chart I'm mostly trade on for hour and you can set a Fibonacci retracement like this let me go and show you how to identify the candle so you can take a Fibonacci retracement let me put it on my candle you can then adjust your Fibonacci retracement number change it to 0.05 percent and now all you have to ask yourself is did this candle you pull a retracement from the low of the candle to the the candle did this candle land the body of the candle close above the top 5% of the candle and if the answer is yes then you have a correct candlestick formation and as you can tell each of these do that so that's one way to spot this gamma stick pattern what I do is just look for the market to only have a 5 pip wick at the top of the candle or less 5 to 6 fifths is the max so a max 5 to 6 pip wick on the top of the candle when I'm trading on a 4-hour chart but you can also use the Fibonacci tool that might make it a little bit easier for you like I said grab your Fibonacci tool with the correct setting of a 5% top 5% of the candle and then there we have it every time you want to see if you are trading the correct pattern you can just use the Fibonacci tool and make sure that that candlestick closed in the top 5% and again if it did close in that top 5% then chances are there was no buying meaning excuse me there was no selling pressure at the end of that time period so chances are there's gonna be buying pressure in the next period and that's what makes this candlestick pattern so powerful now let's move on to actually finding a few of these on sharp data and then I'll teach you a full strategy you can actually test and show you my back testing data of that strategy right after we go over this candlestick pattern on actual charts see you in just a second""]"

views work on your opinions because nothing is going to work until you work on that for example most beginners get in they don't know how to focus on one thing they don't know how to do good work they can't make their bed for lack of better words they're extremely disorganized they have no discipline in their life they have tons of bad people they're not able to remove bad things from their life their goals are super short sight it's make money now make money now make money now if you go look in any beginner group the last thing talked about is the customer the last thing talked about is a customer and the last thing they actually care about is delivering anything good because most beginners get into the business model and I get it this is not hating on beginners this isn't a character fault this is how everybody thinks when they first get in the business they're not pursuing mastery and are not pursuing getting good they're not trying to do hard great work they're not trying to become good at something they're trying to cash out super quickly and all their flaws all their personality traits that they haven't dealt with all their insecurities come leaking out into the business instead of paying employees on time they hold money and instead of trying to get better employees they take short-term decisions the way your business operates the amount of progress you make it's all gonna come down to your views on life and your views on people your ability to make really good decisions and your discipline as a person and your ability to actually manage your own life if you go look in my house for example"", ""and when you're in your twenties just have fun you know that's the best part of your life that's the most enjoyable part of your life you know why those people say that because those people didn't take those years seriously and then they got to their late 20s early 30s into a boss they had to be a slave for the rest of their life that'd be a slave for the rest our life listen to some prick boss that told him do this do that you're not doing your job right in their life just sucked after that their light just sucked because they didn't take that 18 to 20 year old time horizon seriously they didn't focus around that that's what I've heard time and time again and and so the next day if you're 18 years old you're watching us right now the next decade is key you're going to set your entire life up for success failure or mediocrity do you want to be that person in the cubicle at 38 years old who has to listen to a boss on your ass 24/7 who makes your life miserable you know when you're you're barely making ends meet do you want to be in that situation or you want to be in a situation where you control your in your own destiny you have freedom you can make your own decisions that's so those are the questions you have to ask yourself so I've absolutely treated it very seriously I'm going to be 28 years old here in a few months and I've done a lot so far on everything I've done is has prepared me for the next level in my life that has prepared me for the next level I mean everything from running track to getting the track scholarship to getting a good job at quick trip to then transferring from Arizona out to Charlotte North Carolina age 23 age 23 to a whole new place where I knew no one to help my company expand like and imagine how you know important that was in I like to be able to see how a billion-dollar business expands in a new market like imagine you know that was probably way more valuable than any business class I could have ever taken in my life to actually get experience doing that seeing it and performing and executing that type of expansion that's huge guys like think about some of the stuff you know moving out to Nevada starting my own small business my real estate marketing company right starting this channel like building from nothing to $200,000 and then in 2015 losing $75,000 because agree like imagine all these experiences all these things I've experienced already in my life"", ""and I can provide a unique service to a business or sell a unique product to people that are not being served at all how do you do this what you want to do is you want to go and look in face or groups of specific markets probably edge markets everybody's going to go after this market as soon as I mention it right here but for example surgeons who do specific types of surgeries if you were to find for example a specific type of surgeon and go and develop an app for them go and find some way to maximize the phone calls coming into their business find some way for their business that convert 10 percent more people find a product or thingamajig that would allow them make more revenue from their business you could easily sell it for twenty to fifty thousand dollars to them or even make an app that gets people on there and cost fifty thousand dollars a year it's not that's not that hard to do and with basic marketing you could probably get them too biased because no one's really offering this that's what I'm talking about right there so find edge markets and in find where their business can be improved a lot of brick-and-mortar businesses a lot of common business models that have huge upfront sales volumes or cost are completely wide open that's what you want to do first go and read what these people are doing don't go look in marketing groups and business groups and look what they're doing look at what other people and businesses nobody even knows exists are doing for example people that sell the bots that put certain types of packages together for example I had a friend who started the business like this already got into a business like this the business exploded and it had cavemen like sales methods you want to get in a blue ocean and you want to be know how to look for this next sales video copywriting I've generated tens of millions of dollars online because I know how to get in from a video and what to say to get people interested in buying something now the biggest key of all is spotting a market in a product that people actually want to buy and is unique and will deliver value to them the best way to do it is again talking to people in the market and really figuring them out that's the best thing how I created high risk I was literally at a mastermind I was listening to people complain and complain complain about a certain product about a certain problem they had and I fixed that problem for them all those people on the mastermind are great percentage of them are on the product now including all their friends and everybody else one of the main things is once you have a product like that if you can communicate in a sales video how to get them on board this is the best way to do it because then you can simply run ads to that sales video and get them in the next funnel that I'm going to talk about right here""]"

investors are largely feeling unsure or bearish about the current stock market so investing your money in shares may not be the safest option at the moment because of this negative market sentiment it seems like bonds and i bonds in particular are a really reliable place to put your money right now because yeah the government always needs money from the people but here's the problem the feds continue to increase interest rates which will cause bond prices to falter this is destroying the bond market as we speak for example the vanguard total bond market index fund admiral shares has been suffering heavily this past year on top of that we're looking at historically high inflation rates which also diminishes the value of most low yield bonds fortunately this is why we go to series i bonds to save the day and the first question that you guys are probably asking is why are series i bonds inflation proof so these are inflation proof because they pay you a fixed rate of return as well as a variable rate of return that changes as economic inflation changes too and what's even crazier is that series i bonds provide guaranteed returns which also essentially makes them crash proof this feels like a cheat code in the bond market but these assets are fully real and perfectly legal in fact they're literally sponsored by the us treasury so now how do series i bonds work before investing anything it's really important to understand what you're investing into and how it works so basically with series i bonds you're earning monthly interest that is added to your bond every six months more specifically you are earning a fixed interest rate that doesn't change plus an inflation adjustment rates that changes by annually now this interest rate can build up for 30 years or up until the point you sell at your bonds now before we talk about the things that make series i bond so great let's first discuss the disadvantages and trust me guys there are not"", ""but right now people seem to really like CIT Bank Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Ally Bank I'm not sponsored or paid by any of them to tell you this the second way to make sure that your bank accounts are actually making money is to put them to use by buying a bond now you might have seen some scary headlines like 2022 was the worst year on record for bonds even if you go back 250 years 2022 was the worst so why on Earth would anyone suggest buying a bond you see this is why I don't trust YouTubers that's a good idea you shouldn't trust them especially if they do magic tricks but in all seriousness bonds if done the right way cannot lose you money and this is because all a bond is is you lending money to someone else that's someone else in my opinion should almost always be the US government because the US government has never defaulted on its loans it has always paid that money back and once you loan that money out that Bond pays you into interest every six months or twice a year now every single bond has its own maturity date aka the amount of time you loan someone your money for and once that Bond reaches the full maturity date you get to get all of your money back aka the principal investment plus all of the interest that you've made from it the longer you loan your money out for the higher the interest rate will be but that's not always the case now my favorite Bond right now is the series I bonds which are tied to the measure of inflation or the CPI last year they were paying 9.6 interest which is insane so I put in the maximum allowed ten thousand dollars into it and now the money's sitting there and it's collecting interest I made a step-by-step video on how you can buy it from the government website at treasury direct.gov because it's not super simple or straightforward but the cool part is that after 12 months I get all of my initial principal value out plus the interest and that's why I don't care what this bond is worth on the open market because I'm not buying it to trade or sell ahead of time now if I don't want to put away my money for 12 months at the time there's a shorter term bond that is the six month treasury bond and right now that is yielding a juicy 4.8 percent which is still higher than 99 of any savings accounts that I've ever seen so this is a great way that if you know you don't need all of this checking account cash you can just put it away into the six month Bond and now it's generating interest so after six months you get all the money back plus the interest it's a win-win trick number three to start saving money really fast is to maximize your 401k employer contribution matches this is a 100 return on investment now if you're employed you already know this trick"", ""well we got a comment where somebody had put up where they explained that they invested in treasury ETFs so uh tip CTS which is treasury inflation protected securities tips for short now there's a tips ETF that is the I shares tips ETF and basically the higher inflation goes the more yield we get the better the dividends we get in that particular ETF given how high inflation has been and given how bad the stock market has been well you would think that the bond market would be a good place to invest the issue the real issue is that Bond ETFs are different so let's jump into why so this is a chart of the returns of that very same tips ETF so each bar represents a single month and it's looking back over the past five or six years and basically what it's doing is if the bar is green this that ETF was up in that given month if the bar is read the ETF was down in that given month over this entire time period Well the total return was about up 8.4 percent when if we annualize those numbers that means we returned about 1.3 percent per year which is logical given where interest rates have been and what we would expect to return from a government treasury investment we would expect it to be low but we would expect it to be safe over that entire time period that made a lot of sense but now what would happen if we were to Overlay interest rates on top of this chart so this orange line is the Fed funds rate that is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve sets the target interest rate on an overnight basis and basically when you hear Hey the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 75 basis points this is the interest rate that they're talking about but before we go any further there's one important point that is going to make all of this come together if we are either already invested in a bond ETF or if we're thinking about investing in Bonds in general and that is how bonds are tied to yields so we can see that the yield the orange line is the yield the interest rate that is being that is being paid out by the government so the if the price of a bond goes up the yield goes down always that's the way it works assuming the yield stays the same assuming the interest payment stays the same and in bonds they do if the yield go if the price goes down the yield goes up the two act inversely so they're it's sort of like a seesaw effect now that's very important because if you were to buy a bond and interest rates after you bought the bond go higher well people are probably going to sell the bond that you have driving the price down and they're going to buy the bond with the higher yield so your price goes down because that's the bond we owe people are selling that more sellers the price goes down""]"

and the short term nobody knows and in the short term there is really no floor or ceiling for what commodity prices can do and oil is absolutely no exception but in the long term there are a few things that I think are worth sharing now there's some really good research I kind of stumbled across from a guy called Gary Turner who is the CEO of Trove research and he published a really interesting study on basically Returns on equity and Returns on invested capital and Renewables and and oil companies and how that changes at different oil prices now the US is the largest producer of oil in the world and the Returns on equity and Returns on invested Capital that the companies and then you know of course the returns that investors can generate are going to be heavily dependent on the price of oil as Warren Buffett has just told us and uh This research from uh Gary Turner suggests that if oil were to stabilize in the 40 to 60 dollar Barrel range then the typical large U.S oil company would only earn about a four percent return on Capital and within that 40 to 60 dollar range those Returns on investor Capital actually changed quite dramatically uh at sixty dollar oil the average large U.S oil and gas company would earn about an eight percent return on invested capital and at forty dollar oil they would earn about a 1.3 return on invested Capital so all of that is to say that if oil were to get below say forty to sixty dollars a barrel in the very long term the US basically doesn't have a sustainable oil industry the returns will be too anemic to Warrant you know new Investments so that sort of puts potentially a longer term flaw on oil prices and you would think that over time the cost of production for oil will tend to go up we have that just through General inflation and asset prices and labor prices going up but we also have that through sort of the physical reality ways of finding oil you know all the easy oil has largely been sucked out of the ground already and oil companies are having to get sort of increasingly heroic and go further distances and so on to find new oil now in terms of a potential sealing price or upper limit for where Oil could go to there's a pretty famous saying in commodity businesses that the cure to high prices is high prices and that basically means that as commodity prices go up and companies start earning very high sort of super normal Returns on Capital that tends to encourage more people to produce that particular commodity and earn those super high Returns on Capital and that of course pushes prices back down again if it gets too extreme you have sort of the marginal producers of a particular commodity kind of pull back and restrain production and that's how you have these Epson flows and commodity prices over time but there are a few things that are potentially different this time and I know that is the most dangerous phrase and invest in but you have this very kind of political situation where producing more oil is very very frowned upon and you also have an investor base that is really demanding a capital return through dividends or BuyBacks having been burnt in a recent cycle add to that the fact again that oil will without doubt get harder to find over time I really don't know what the cln 2 oil prices could be now to sum up Buffett's investment case at an Occidental and Chevron I actually think it's very simple there's a lot of moving Parts here but I think there are really two core drivers behind this investment from Buffett firstly I think he probably has a view that long-term oil prices will be higher and they'll be higher for longer than most investors probably anticipate in many ways there is the structural mismatch between oil supply and oil demand and if those two things that I just said turn out to be correct they can really only mean one thing for oil prices which is that they have to go up the second thing that I think Buffett likes is that there is very little capital expenditure for growth he's getting a lot of his cash back very quickly through dividends and BuyBacks particularly when oil prices are as high as they have been recently oils come back a little bit in the past month but you know if we look at just the sheer amount of cash flow that companies like Occidental have been producing it's been pretty insane I mean oxy produced 4.2 billion dollars of free cash flow in their second quarter this year which is a six percent free cash flow yield just from that one quarters cash flow they also retired 4.8 billion in debt and purchase back 1.1 billion of stock"", ""they can make more money number two they can spend less money or number three they can increase the cred credit card limit and continue taking loans out from the credit card because they now have a higher line of credit that's what the US government is doing every single year when this becomes an issue instead of raising expenditure by raising taxes or cutting the deficit by cutting expenditure the government just kicks the can down the road by raising the debt ceiling this debt ceiling then therefore becomes a political football between fiscal conservatives who want to cut expenditure and liberals that want to increase expenditure while also increasing taxes and that's the exact position that we're in right now there has become a showdown between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican house Speaker Kevin McCarthy house Speaker Kevin McCarthy leads a theoretically Coalition of fiscal conservatives that want to get the budget under control Joe Biden leads the Democrats who are much more inclined to spend more money and just raise the deficit even farther Kevin McCarthy and Joe Biden have been going back and forth for weeks trying to reach some kind of agreement that would raise the debt limit stopping the United States government from entering into a default just a couple of days ago speaker McCarthy tweeted this I just got off the phone with president obedico after he wasted time and refused to negotiate for months we've come to an agreement in principle that is worthy of the American people it seems that there's a last minute agreement coming through and there more than likely will be nobody on Capitol Hill wants to be the person that caused the entire global economy to collapse but the uncertainty of whether or not that will occur is hanging over the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and stock market like a dark cloud and for good reason treasury secretary Janet Yellen says a U.S default would trigger a global economic downturn and Moody's predicts that a default would lead to 6 million jobs lost 12 trillion dollars in household wealth evaporating and four percent of gross domestic products disappearing on top of that that would lead to a complete demise of United States treasuries which are widely considered to be the safest investment you can possibly make a default on U.S debt would be the destruction of the United States economy and would send shock waves through geopolitics for the rest of the century basically it'd be the movie 2012 meets the big short but the debt ceiling is likely to have an agreement rate Sean in the next couple of days and then after that comes through we'll likely see a rally on the stock market which will then lead to a rally on bitcoin however it's not all Sunshine rainbows after that happens because we're still having to deal with CPI you see the Consumer Price Index is a metric that tracks inflation in the United States economy and everything thing from shelter to gasoline to natural gas or electricity to eggs and then CPI is broken up into two categories number one all items and number two all items minus food and energy while all items has been coming down nicely to 4.9 percent all items less food and energy currently sits at 5.5 percent and its drop is completely stagnative over the course of the last five months CPI dropping is a very good thing but the problem is all items and core inflation that being all items minus food and energy have both started to stagnate right around five percent and this season of inflation coming down very aggressively is likely to be over starting this month when the next data comes out on June 13th in fact many economists are predicting that inflation is going to get a lot stickier under the five percent Mark for all items and for core inflation and that's very important because that impacts Jerome Powell's fed's decision on effective federal funds right hikes you see the effect of federal funds rate is described by the New York fed like this the effective federal funds rate is calculated as a volume weighted median of overnight federal funds transactions in English the effective federal funds rate is more or less the base rate that all other interest rates in the United States economy are based off of that includes car loans Home Loans personal loans commercial loans and pretty much any other kind of loan including credit card loans whenever the infected federal funds rate increases then that causes every single other interest rate to increase which increase the cost of taking on debt which reduces the amount of liquidity in the United States market and makes it harder to expand because we live in a credit and debt based society the FED has been hiking rates at their fastest rate in over 40 years in a Hail Mary attempt to try and get inflation under control the problem is that inflation is not going down anymore because of the hiking interest rates it's staying sticky at five percent because of various geopolitical realities that the FED has no power over whereas many of us were hoping for a Fed rate pause come June 14th when the meeting happens now many people including myself are predicting that we're going to see another 25 basis point rate hike from 5.15 percent all the way up to 5.4 another rate hike when we were hoping for a pause would almost certainly lead to a major drop in Bitcoin especially considering the right decision will come out the day after CPI comes out which is likely to be lackluster in conclusion Bitcoin has been looking forward to a very bullish June as a result of a recent Lux algo Buy Signal and a bullish cross on on macd followed by a bullish cross above the 50 level on RSI however as a result of the uncertainty around the debt ceiling we've seen timidity coming from the United States stock market as it attempts to break above critical resistance at 420 that timidity is spilled over into Bitcoin and means that it's having a hard time going into a rally as well that timidity on U.S stocks is going to continue until we reach a decision on the debt ceiling hike because many people are predicting if a decision does not get made and the United States defaults on its debt the stock market could drop by over 45 percent 20 trillion dollars and while there is most likely going to be a decision reached which will lead to that timidity Vanishing in the United States stock market just a week after that decision is probably going to be raged on June 5th or 6th then we're probably going to see bearish data coming from CPI in the very next day on June 14th we're going to see a Fed rate hike when we were hoping for a pause all of that to mean that the first two weeks of June are shaping up to actually be very difficult for Bitcoin and if we see any bullishness from Bitcoin we should take that as a great sign of the health of the market because it's got so many things standing in its way right now but the thing I want you guys to remember is that these dark clouds are temporary I just decision on the debt ceiling will be made in the next week and the decision that seems to be taking place will kick the can down the road for another two years and we won't have to worry about until January of 2025."", ""so you're asking oil companies to further lower what makes you think that they are going to listen to an Administration that is ultimately trying to put them out of business how how is the administration trying to put them out of business well they produce fossil fuels and this President says he wants to end fossil fuel so look there's a couple of other things at play in terms of the investors and these oil companies firstly we've come out of a couple of really interesting phases of the oil cycle in 2007 and eight the last time that oil companies really rocketed up and oil prices were very high there was a lot of incentive for oil companies to grow and to deploy capital and finding more oil and that really caused quite a significant oversupply in the oil Market it meant that oil prices went down and really there were a lot of investors burned from encouraging companies to go through that exercise so there's been a real shift and if you listen to the likes of the Occidental quarterly conference calls you'll no longer hear them talking a lot about finding new oil and spending a lot of money on Capital expenditures to drill more Wells and so on uh you'll instead hear them talking a lot about debt repayment about sheer BuyBacks and about paying dividends to shareholders and finally there's some research that I covered in a previous video here on the channel that suggests that over the very long term if oil were to get below the say 40 to 60 dollar per barrel range it would really no longer be economic for most oil companies to exist so anything can happen in the short term with all sorts of commodity prices but that probably is some sort of very long-term floor for oil so to sum up where I think Buffett's head is probably out if I really had to guess I think there's probably two core factors really at play when he's investing in the likes of Occidental and Chevron I think firstly he probably has a view that oil prices stay higher for longer than most people anticipate and secondly I think he really likes the capital allocation taking place at these companies limited capital expenditure for growth and exploration and a lot of cash being funneled back towards shareholders through debt repayments dividends and share BuyBacks and to an extent I think that second capital allocation points probably reinforces the first point of oil prices Staying High if every company is just doing a bunch of sheer BuyBacks and paying dividends and no one's spending money on looking for new oil that is another kind of big constraint over the long term on oil supply now I recently actually got the chance to sit down and interview Jake Taylor who some of you may know from the value after hours podcast he's also the CEO of Farnam Street Investments and the author of The Rebel allocator the full podcast episode with Jake will be going live probably later this week on the investing with Tom podcast YouTube channel on and on all audio platforms as well and I just want to play a clip of something that Jake said in that podcast episode really exactly on some of the points I've been discussing in this video like I'm very hopeful that Humanity will make the transition from hydrocarbons to more renewable sources of energy and I think we will get there eventually I just think it's going to take a long time and as an investor if everyone thinks it's going to take a short time and you think it's going to take longer that that has often been a pretty good bet to make is that things take longer than than everyone thinks now we all know that Warren Buffett is a value investor anytime he's looking to buy into a particular company and oil is no exception he's looking to buy that business below its intrinsic value and he actually mentioned specifically in the 2007 annual shareholder meeting for Birch Hathaway uh how he thinks about investing in oil companies he said if we are in an oil stock it's because we think it offers a lot of value at this price but it does not mean we think the price of oil is going up if we thought oil was going up we could buy oil Futures which we actually did once so how exactly does Warren Buffett calculate something like intrinsic value for an oil company because these businesses are very different from a apple or Microsoft or Costco which a very steady businesses that produce stable and growing amounts of cash flow and earnings oil companies are quite different they can be very very volatile and the earnings year to year are heavily influenced by the price of oil again I want to play another clip here from my interview with Jake Taylor where he presents a pretty nice idea of thinking about valuation with some of these very cyclical businesses I think I ideally in a in like that type of commodity company you would you probably like Buy on Price to Book and sell on PE so

important and hence that's why i don't spend my money buying luxury clothes the main point here is you don't need expensive and luxury clothes all you need is comfortable clothing that at least looks somewhat good next up is really bad or super expensive food similar with luxury clothing i used to view expensive food as sort of a luxury and status symbol now not so much on the other side of the spectrum i also know the importance of not eating really bad food so really there's a whole scale in the types of food you can eat on a day-to-day basis on the very left is really crappy foods like mcdonald's and processed foods and on the very right we have things like the french laundry where a single meal can be you know close to a thousand dollars per person zooming in on the very left all this really cheap stuff these types of foods are all processed in efficient factories for example your average one dollar box of mac and cheese it just contains wheat artificial cheese and chemical flavors slightly to the right we have places like mcdonald's and other fast food now i will say that every day more than one in three u.s adults eat some type of restaurant fast food it's a really big reason why health is starting to deteriorate in this country then you have things like fruit meats fish which are between let's say a dollar and ten dollars a pound the process to get these natural foods processed and then to the store is just much more expensive and that's why they cost a lot more especially if you look at it per calorie now if you take a look at some of the data on how much millionaires spend on groceries you can actually see that they don't spend that much money about one-third of millionaires surveyed spend less than 300 each month on groceries about 64 spend less than 450 and then less than 1 in 5 millionaires spend more than 600 per month at the end of the day net worth doesn't influence your nutritional needs we're all human rich people don't for example need more nutrients than people that are more poor"", ""[Music] the average american household spends more than seven thousand seven hundred dollars per year on food expenses for most households this is our third largest expense only behind housing and transportation and if you live in an urban area food is your second largest expense statistically so we spend a lot of money on food obviously we need food to survive but how can we save money on food i save thousands of dollars per year as compared to maybe the average person on food expenses by using a variety of different tactics i'm gonna share with you in this video and it's not by starving yourself or or by uh eating at at some obscure place that you're getting like 50 cent uh food items i don't know where the hell is going with that so let's get started with this video i think there's gonna be some really fun topics in here i'll show you some of the actual strategies that i use in my kitchen might cook a couple things as well we've had quite a few requests for uh some some nate cooking videos so we might slide in a couple little recipes in there but let's get started here and let's start with the first kind of idea that we need to think about when we're trying to save money on foods that we're not spending seven thousand dollars per year but maybe getting it down to uh three or four thousand dollars per year on food expenses while still being healthy so the first thing we have to do is we have to plan ahead now obviously this this seems pretty obvious it seems pretty simple um but many people don't do this so what we need to do here is before we walk into a grocery store because we haven't eaten in two days and we're starving and we're just gonna spend like 400 on random food because we're so hungry don't go to the grocery store on an empty stomach this is like the first big problem but the worst is when people go to the store on an empty stomach and they also don't have a plan for the week so start planning out your meals ahead of time plan them out for a week i basically have six different blocks of meals that i line up four weeks and then i can alternate these weeks"", ""[Music] so food is one of the largest expenses that we have in our lives in fact it actually comes in at number three only behind housing costs and transportation costs so the average American household spends about seven thousand seven hundred and twenty nine dollars per year on food alone so in this video I'm going to show you some ways you can cut back on food expenses while still getting plenty of nutrients and the things that you need to keep yourself very healthy and so what we're gonna do in this video is I'm going to show you what I've personally done to save some money on food but still balancing that out with eating healthy foods I think there's kind of this misconception that it's very difficult to eat healthy for little amounts of money hopefully we can debunk that today in this video but we were actually pretty hesitant to make this because you know people have very different goals and agendas when it comes to eating food and nutrition and look I'm not a dietitian I'm not a nutritionist I'm not a doctor this is what works for me this is what I've done in the past I spend a little bit more money on food now as my budget has been increasing as my income has been increasing but I'm going to show you what I've done in the past and look everybody has different goals some people want to lose weight some people are trying to gain weight some people are gluten-free or vegan or they only eat meat there's just so many different types of diets out there that this is not a one-size-fits-all video what you need to keep in mind for today's video is that this is really oriented on getting the most bang for your buck when it comes to eating food so we're looking at the most calories we're looking at the most food possible for about 30 to 40 dollars per week and and let's just get started with this let's actually go over the grocery store right now I'm gonna give you a lot of different tips and tricks that you can use to cut back on cost quite a bit""]"

launching an evm chain I would consider this generally a bullish sign for a protocol that they're keeping up with the times and looking to innovate wherever possible let's look at the next Bridge step as we continue with assets over on kava now we can move to satellite.money selecting Cava from the origin chain and polygon from the destination chain we'll go ahead and move back over to polygon this time swapping back to wrap teeth here we initiate the swap transaction which is a five stage process signing first with our wallet selecting Max and then next and then approving the bridge transaction fee next we're asked asked to sign one more transaction in order to process the transfer once complete we can see a summary at the bottom and we have an option to make another transfer so here we are back on polygon we've almost reached the end of our massive bridging Expo but we've got one more step to go to put us back on ethereum it's going to be a doozy so let's take a look at this point returning to wallet.polygon.technology we're able to view our Wallet balance on polygon here we can see that our eth assets have returned to our wallet and that we're still holding the majority of them in exploring the different cross-chain protocols available for moving assets from polygon to other networks including back to ethereum in many cases the fee to return our assets to the ethereum mainnet nearly matched the amount that we were holding this was the case with connexed a bridge we didn't use this time but one we have used in the past we had similar issues when exploring new protocols where the ethereum fee took a long time to generate and ultimately was more than the assets we were holding situations where the preview amount was very close to our origin amount indicated that a gas fee needed to be paid in Matic at today's market rate this would be about a 95 gas fee this prompted us to return to Seabridge our original Network used to bridge from ethereum to polygon in order to bridge back the reason being that the final received amount after gas fees does not exceed the balance that we're holding and only uses about half of our resources selecting transfer and then confirm transfer and then confirming with our software wallet processes the bridge transaction selecting pending from the top right allows us to see the transaction in process once complete we can see the bridge amount reflected in our balance with our assets back on ethereum our steps are not quite complete our final procedure in bridging is to turn our remaining eth into native Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain here's how we do that using Thor swap found at app.thoreswap.finance Swap here we have the option to swap native ethereum for Native Bitcoin connecting our metamask wallet first here the maximum amount that we can select is adjusted based on the amount we'll need for gas here we'll paste in a Bitcoin address that we control normally we'd be able to process this swap transaction with limited fees receiving our assets over on the Bitcoin Network unfortunately due to the congestion on bitcoin created by Bitcoin ordinals we're unable to do this at this time as Thor chain has paused Bitcoin withdraws for the time being it's likely that new updates to the Bitcoin blockchain will fix this restoring access to this interoperability method going forward"", ""so next stop we're bridging to ethereum l2s these networks are a little different because the ethereum that we're moving over will actually become gas on the L2 this is not true for the other networks we're visiting and because of that we need to separate out our Bridge amount from the amount that we're keeping in the wallet for gas we can do this by checking the block Explorer to see how much we received following the previous Bridge let's take a look next we'll be moving our ethereum between the two most popular layer 2 defy environments on ethereum specifically arbitrum and optimism navigating to Stargate we see that we have a bridge route available here here we want to verify the amount of eth that was received on the arbitrum side after moving from Kronos once verified we can paste that amount into our Bridge interface over on Stargate with the amount specified we're ready to process the bridge transaction select and confirm and monitoring the interface for confirmation after a few minutes we can see that our assets have arrived via Stargate to optimism like with arbitrum we're going to take a look at the fully transferred amount in order to figure out how much we're going to send over to Avalanche here we can see this amount of ethereum coming in through Stargate protocol a little bit ago before we can Bridge our assets to Avalanche we need to swap them for wrapped ethereum assets we can do this using one-inch protocol here we see that slippage is not a factor but there is a transfer fee involved selecting confirm swap we'll swap our eth assets for wrapped eth next we'll return to seller bridge and move the entirety of our wrapped ethereum assets over to Avalanche first approving wrap teeth for spending by seller Bridge once approved we're ready to transfer our assets again confirming the transfer on our metamask wallet once confirmed on optimism we just need to wait for the transaction to confirm on Avalanche as well again this may take a few minutes we made it that was Bridge five we're nearly halfway there it's a great time for us to talk a little bit about how these Bridges work now there are a few different types we have mint and burn as it's often called isonomes call it lock box receipt because because the lock box is where the tokens are stored on the origin Network and the receipt is what you receive on the destination Network representative of the value of that token the other model is interlocking pools of liquidity and that's what we see with multi-chain the protocol we were using earlier in either case though we're processing a transaction on both networks and that's an important aspect to how this works whenever you're bridging you need to wait not only for confirmation of the first transaction but also the confirmation on the destination Network once that's received our assets are available and fully bridged by viewing the black Explorer for Avalanche snowtrace.io we can take a look at our assets as they come through the bridge selecting erc20 token transactions here we see wrapped ethereum removing the filter we're able to see all the incoming transactions for this asset next using Wormhole we can move the wrap teeth that we just transferred over now wrapped eth.e over to Oasis selecting next prompts us to confirm that transaction here we need to select manual payment as we will need to process a transaction using rows in order to complete this bridge selecting approve will approve our current supply of wrapped teeth for transfer we'll select max amount and then next approve once complete we're ready to transfer our assets via portal Bridge select and confirm and then confirming again with our wallet and paying the requested fee once the transaction is complete and with Oasis Emerald Rose in our wallet we're able to redeem the funds on the Oasis Network this is the Oasis Emerald Paradigm an evm layer on Oasis selecting confirm and then signing again with our wallet so that last Bridge transaction moved our eth assets from Avalanche over to Oasis Network actually the Oasis Emerald Paradigm which is the evm layer now that they're there there isn't a lot we can do with them because liquidity is too thin so instead we need to bridge them back luckily we can do this with limited slippage let's take a look taking a look at the Oasis Foundation Oasis emerald block Explorer we're able to see our recent token transfers this includes the wrapped eth.e coming into our wallet selecting the asset wrapped ether through Wormhole we see that we're the first person to use this particular Bridge route in about a year and that there are only 19 addresses holding this particular asset for this reason it's possible that we don't have any other options for our ether on this chain without moving it back through the same Bridge here we again select the max amount before bridging back to Avalanche this time approving our Bridge deep assets again for spending this time by Oasis Network and then selecting the transfer option to complete the transfer finally signing another transaction to redeem the assets back on Avalanche next stop is one of the newest Bridge protocols on the scene squid router we haven't played a lot with Squid router"", ""but we also incorporate some other Solutions and even more going on on the back end and we're going to try to dissect and explain all of it as we go keep an eye out throughout this video because when you see this screen that means we're about to enter another Bridge battery each bridge will be labeled with a number that's how many Bridge instances we've gone through so far we're also going to mention which chain we're starting from and which chain we're moving to along with the amount of gas and the type of assets needed to pay gas on that Network keep an eye out for these as we move throughout the Expo without any further Ado let's get started to begin with we're over on ethereum with some eth Assets in our wallet hit the like And subscribe let's go today we begin on the ethereum mainnet with 0.055 ethereum available for spending this is about a hundred dollars in today's money our first stop is seller Bridge here we have the option to swap between networks we're going to bridge first from ethereum to polygon processing a swap transaction and select and confirm after a few minutes here we can see the transaction pending on the Block Explorer once confirmed we'll be able to see the balance in our wallet at wallet.polagon.technology at this point we've completed our first Bridge transaction once the funds settle we'll be ready to interact with them now over on polygon for our next Bridge transaction we're going to be using synapse protocol over at synapse we're able to take a look at the available tokens for bridging unfortunately ethereum is not supported between polygon and Kronos our intended destination Network however using one-inch protocol we can swap for usdc assets and then swap them back to eth later on we also have the advantage of using the fusion router here the fusion router will allow us to perform this transaction without using any gas at all here we need to give permission for one inch protocol to use our eth assets signing a transaction to approve signing with our wallet here does not incur a gas fee once approved we're able to process a transaction swapping our eth assets for usdc on polygon once the transaction confirms we can head back over to synapse over at synapse we now have the option to bridge our usdc assets using the protocol here we'll select Chronos our destination Network specifying the max amount of usdc in our wallet we can initiate the bridge transaction""]"

you so much for letting us know before the problem got worse all of a sudden all parties are happy and the problem is solved this is contrasted with the example of a tenant complaining directly to an owner when that may be that owner is at work their stress through the roof and they snip back and say something in jest or not or in seriousness very quickly can't you fix it are you serious or some kind of snippy response that immediately elevates concerns on the tenant side that's the benefit of a property manager is this sort of middleman approach that takes the emotion and stress out of the problem here's an even better example tenant says hey order we've got ants owner quickly replies back it goes well then why don't you put your dirty food in the trash and stop leaving leftovers out not a good idea ultimately the best case for property is owner is happy tenant is happy because otherwise turnover happens turnover is expensive let's contrast that with a property manager tenant says hey we've got ants property manager"", ""so if you have a property manager great you have that anonymous nature of the tenant not knowing who you are you're set option number two you manage the property yourself you should tell the tenant that you are the manager for the property that's not lying you are telling the tenant I'm the manager for the property if they then ask you bluntly are you the owner or they say I know you're the owner here are some suggested responses if they say are you the owner the response is I'm the property manager and then ideally divert to some kind of different topic if they do confront you and say I know you're the owner and they expect a response from you the response might be something like and you're not lying you say I am a part owner of the property but I'm not the sole decision maker and if you are the 100% owner of that property then say I do own the property"", ""today we're talking about the number one rule of property management what you should never say to a tenant first to make sense of this rule we need to understand the middleman phenomenon or middle person to make you gender neutral although middleman rolls off the tongue a little easier so we're gonna stick with that one middleman is a slang term for an intermediary that provides a service but also charges a fee or a commission because of that it's sort of built a negative connotation over time but if you understand the concept of a middleman you'll understand the concept of what you should never tell a tenant coming up let's analyze this just like in real estate sales with buyers on one side and sellers on the other tenants sit on one side across the table from landlords and they each have different desires and perspectives because of this opposing relationship they naturally tend to have an adversarial relationship with the other party that is even though they're working together for their common benefit that is the tenant gets a place to live and the landlord gets rental income they tend to have an atmosphere relationship because the tenant generally wants to pay less in rent and be able to do more such as have dogs or paint walls whatever colors they want whereas a landlord wants to make less changes to the property do less repairs but collect more on rent the same is true for buyers and sellers buyers want to pay less sellers won again more there's no surprise here but this natural dichotomy creates a tinderbox for emotions guilt appeals to pity fake friendships and drama now this isn't to say that there aren't some landlords that don't have excellent relationships with their tenants or can be friends with their tenants and can get along and the bottom line is in almost any relationship when things are going good everybody's happy it's when things get a little bit more complicated that friend relationships can very quickly turn ugly now how does the middleman come into play with this and what should I never tell a tenant let's explain the concept of the middleman phenomenon by talking about a property manager I'm the property manager a property manager is a classic middleman who is incentivized by both the tenant being happy and the owner being happy to make the entire transactional process of a tenancy significantly easier and stress-free for all parties involved when both sides have expectations hopefully set by that great property manager and both sides follow the rules of the agreement that have been created again hopefully by that great property manager then generally the level of stress and a tendency can be very low all of this is under the guidance of that middle person see the property manager doesn't just make the process of a landlord tenancy relationship simpler by facilitating paperwork photos repairs or putting a property on the market a property manager is a classic case of the middleman somebody who can remove emotion from discussions convey local norms of what customs our culture dictate happen in a certain rental market balance the priorities of both the landlord and the tenant in a reasonable manner of course and conduct business in a communicative way so that nobody feels like they're left in the dark ultimately they filter out the drama and get to the facts they get to the bottom of things so that they can handle things in a reasonable manner the nature of a middleman now let's make an example of no property manager involved tenant has problem talks to owner hay owner that faucet you worked on last time is leaking again owners typical reaction ah whiny tenant go screw yourself the order may not actually say that""]"
