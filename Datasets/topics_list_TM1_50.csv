use during day trading not really a lot of the day trading indicators that are useful inside of traditional markets the V WAP being one that's that's one that I haven't talked about the channel I really felt like mentioning it but to be fair with you all I don't use that or any other crazy indicators today trade I used two major things I use moving averages and I use price levels for resistance and support really you don't need any complex Fibonacci combination you know Elliot wave theory you know there's nothing like that that you need a lot of it is simple price level support and it sees you know the price will see whether or not it can sustain at certain levels and I'll show you why it's so simple and so important and of course this isn't some secret you know simplified trading method that's just gonna guarantee you millions but no trading really isn't I think what people make it out to be in a lot of cases especially in new markets like crypto currencies so we have two moving averages here I'm going to go over these real quick as you can see when Bitcoin is in a bull market when it is killing it you'll see that in a lot of cases we can even go back to the previous bull run out of the August fork we could see that Bitcoin relatively remained a of the 50-day and if not it found support around the 200-day and once you know it really got into rally mode there was rarely any occasions that it went below the 50 now when you start seeing dips below the 50 you look for support on the 200 our because the 50 our is the bullish indicator if it's staying above the 50 our men market is killing it in this case Bitcoin is doing fantastic however when it starts to go down below the 50 you're looking for okay why don't we might need a little bit of a you know a short-term cooldown we're looking to hopefully maybe get a pullback and find support at the 200 hour now you can break the 200 hour that might show that there's a little bit of market fear in the more cases where you see for example here and then also here you start seeing larger dips under the 200 hour that can indicate that you are stepping up towards a reversal in the market and you do have to you know keep accordance of those larger moves when you're day trading so as we come over here save case we rarely after we actually started the bull market rally for the third phase of this year we've had very few cases where we dip below $200 but we could start to see that same trend where is a little bit and then a larger amount"", ""so i already set a trade i'm going to show you that

don't it always takes work guys and that's any relationship I don't care if you're really sure it's just a friendly relationship or your significant other like you always got to be willing to put in the work the minute you stop putting in the work is the minute things start falling down a little bit by a little bit in the same way if you have a business and you also decide man I don't really want to put in the work I just want to go on vacation for the next month or two months can your business survive probably is it going to be hurt significantly or or at least a little bit I would say a little bit for sure impossibility of even significantly because you were absent all that time and who knows what the hell was happening with the business unless you've got some great manager to run the business while you're gone um let's think about stocks I mean if you you could just throw money at some stocks and hope it works out for the next ten years but I'm going to tell you the the one that's actually paying attention to stuff all those ten years and you know it's looking for new investments and opportunities and when they get a big gain over a couple years you know selling that game and put it in the next company that could potentially have their game I'm almost guarantee you they're going to probably do much better than the guy that you know just puts money in an index fund and throws it away for the next ten years or 15 years never looks at the money unless unless the stock picker is just so horrible that they can't pick stocks correctly so that's just kind of how it goes guys relationships financials set expectations up front don't don't just you know do whatever like make sure you got a plan there and that's just my feelings on this whole relationship and finances game guys so I hope this video helps you out if you're a male out there and I know there's going to be some guys that are just negative and you know had a bad relationship or got cheated on or saw this or saw that and you just always have a negative a negative view on that same way some people have it with the stock market like they just had you know something happened the stock market they saw someone lose money or they lost money in the stock and I screw that the stock markets a scam or they try to business once""]"

list could pump in response to upcoming events and announcements the next steps are to decide how much to allocate and when to take profits it should go without saying that going all in on a crypto you think is going to pump is a very bad idea this is because there is no guarantee that the pump will play out exactly as you projected it could start earlier or later last longer or shorter go higher or even go down in response to the news you're banking on in a worst case scenario your investment could go to zero and though you've heard this about crypto before it's especially applicable in this case that's because it's safe to say that big cryptos like bitcoin are here to stay but the same can't be said for many of the altcoins you'll inevitably end up holding as part of your mission to the moon as such it's wise to put down only what you're willing to lose not only will this help minimize your losses but it will also make cashing out easier if or when the gains start to come in that's because it's really hard to take profits if you have a huge allocation and prices are going parabolic reducing your exposure will make it easier to abide by a risk-off profit-taking strategy as i mentioned in my video about my personal crypto trading strategy the irrationality of the market often means that any sort of logical analysis doesn't work when prices really start to pump that's why i personally take profits based on the percentage gains i have rather than any psychologically comfortable price points or price targets revealed by ta more importantly i tend to keep some of my coins and tokens in the race in case the rally continues this can and often does happen especially when market euphoria is at an all-time high on that note it's worth quickly pointing out that smaller altcoins don't always care about what the rest of the crypto market is doing all coins almost always follow bitcoin's lead but there have been many instances of altcoins continuing to pump even as the rest of the market carries on dumping even so it's important to be aware of what the rest of the market is doing and factor that into your measurements allocations and profit taking strategies if we're bleeding red across the board you might want to reduce the height and length of any pumps you're predicting reduce your allocations and lower your cash out expectations in the short term once you've decided how much to allocate and when to take profits for the cryptos on your pump list the last step is to consider whether any of those cryptos has some serious longer longer-term potential chances are you'll come across a couple of these during your crypto quest and you'll know you've found a winner when you see some most or all of the following features first and foremost there's a use case or utility for the coin or token that creates constant demand for it this is because the constant buying pressure should increase its price over time second the coin or token is listed on a few reputable exchanges like kucoin and binance but has yet to list on any u.s exchanges like coinbase kraken or gemini this is because most of the money flowing into crypto is coming from the united states and as regulators continue to crack down on offshore exchanges more of this capital is staying on u.s exchanges the thing to keep in mind here is that the cryptocurrency you think has long-term potential could be too similar to a security i.e a stock in a company to us regulators this means u.s cryptocurrency exchanges won't be able to list that coin or token now you can familiarize yourself with the criteria currently used to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security or not by watching my video about the ripple versus sec lawsuit in the description the third feature of a crypto with long-term potential is lots of partnerships with popular crypto projects and protocols this is because the future of cryptocurrency is interoperability and if a crypto project has made little to no effort to cooperate and integrate with its competitors it will have a hard time flourishing in the future the fourth feature of a crypto with long-term potential is lots of vc funding assuming this vc funding comes after the cryptocurrency's main net has launched already as i mentioned in my video about the most funded crypto projects this is because any investments made by vc's post main net are a strong sign that the project is legit and still has a lot of potential the fifth feature of a crypto with long-term potential is constant development and innovation this is because the crypto space is insanely competitive and a failure to evolve can be fatal for a project the last feature of a crypto with long-term potential ties into the fifth and that's the absence of any serious competition within that cryptos niche this is because a monopoly on a certain technology or use case is insanely profitable as proven by chain link which dominates cryptocurrency's oracle niche now these are just a few of the features that define a crypto project with long-term potential and you can learn about the others by watching my video on how to find promising altcoins it's up there in the top right they say you can't predict a crypto pump but recently i found that these pumps usually have many of the same characteristics this methodology can be summed up in a single sentence and that's to pay very close attention to what's going on in cryptocurrency and be honest with yourself about what you see and what it means i personally don't chase pumps mainly because i don't think it's a sustainable long-term investment strategy i prefer to stick to huddling and swing trading cryptocurrencies i believe to be legit because there's more to life than chasing pumps and crying over dumps having said that it is interesting to go digging through the lower levels of the coin market cap leaderboards every now and then and observing some of the crazy price action in those low-cap altcoins which one could be next that's my two cents for you today folks if you enjoyed the video be sure to give that like a spike remember to subscribe to the channel and ping that notification bell if you want to keep getting quality crypto content with minimal hype now a lot of you have been asking me if i could cover urgent topics in a timelier manner"", ""so our top trade idea right now is MF Miss fresh very fresh indeed some would say fresh eat though this fresh is in the consumer defensive space and they are trading at just a lick just a little lick above 52 two week laws despite having a pretty solid fundamental picture behind them I often like to find the most damning charts for my top trade ideas because if you can find stocks that the market has almost unanimously given up on and has unanimously decided that they don't want to touch and at the same time the company attached to that ticker if it has an actual business model even if it's not insane but if it has an operating business model well oftentimes that's all you need for a massive massive squeeze or at least the massive massive rally ralita sort of like an underdog Arbitrage situation where the stock is such an underdog that everybody hates it it looks so sketchy to touch no one wants to even look that way and when you have these Underdog trades well what happens is that if there's any sort of semblance of a business well that means there could be an insane Ricochet effect and you've already seen a lot of proof of concept of that during today's market hours and I think you're going to see more and more of these types of runs you go over to dilution tracker as you know I am allergic to two things in this world dilution and also penicillin but the second one's not relevant but dilution tracker says the overall risk is low offering ability is low dilution amount excluding shelf is low historical dilution is low and cash need is low in fact dilution tracker estimates the company has about 54.9 months of cash left so very solid from that standpoint if these numbers are correct now of course it's worth mentioning though that when you're talking about super small cap companies and you're talking about four and ones especially there can be a discrepancy between the reporting the estimates and what actually is going on and that's fine because in that discrepancy there's a lot of opportunity for trading and debate in the market to happen and that's where a lot of the fun comes in because you could trade off those moves if everything was clear and everybody had decided on evaluation of a stock well it would be flat there'd be no opportunities it's where you get into these really really small caps and some of these sketchier areas of the market where people a lot of people don't want to touch that's where you get a lot of those rally rally toe opportunities it's also where you get a lot of risk though right got to keep that in mind but anywho if you're looking at the dilution tracker numbers looks pretty good now this is a company that did their original IPO with JPMorgan City cicc and China Renaissance in mid-2021 that was at a price of 13 and the offering amount was 273 million now in days though even after today's run well the stock is trading at a market cap of just 6.39 million dollars that's a really really far cry right sure things have been bad in the super small cap market and in foreign markets and Asia and all that kind of stuff"", ""so thank you guys so much and now with that said let's begin alright so before we talk about the best upcoming opportunities you first need to understand what you're going to be up against and to start we need to talk about a recession generally recessions are accompanied by a significant rise in unemployment a drop in wages a loss in consumer confidence and a decline in values across everything from stocks food energy and services with sometimes long lasting effects throughout the entire world but second along with the recession usually comes a decline in earnings see every quarter companies report the revenue and give guidance on their future outlook but lately they've been cutting forecasts bracing for slow or even negative growth inciting recession risks at the highest Pace in 10 years that leads us to third layoffs when consumers earn less they spend less and when companies see less demand they begin to scale back on their expenses with usually employees being the first to get let go in fact just a quick Google search for Mass layoffs shows you dozens upon dozens of companies who are are all trimming their Workforce and as Bank of America explains the U.S economy will soon start losing 175 000 jobs per month so in terms of what this means for you and your Investments as well as how you could use this information to make you money let's start here with number one stocks as of now all three major indexes are down between 20 and 30 percent with analysts like JP Morgan who believe that we have another 20 to go from current levels however if we take a look throughout history since 1946 the average bear Market drop was close to 30 percent with the most severe having been in 2009 when the S&P500 fell 57 from the peak now once you combine the average with the recession bear markets tend to do even worse with an average drop of 34.8 percent which just for reference right now we're down about 25 all of that is to say that generally the absolute bottom occurs when we see capitulation across investors usually that's a time of the start of the recovery and things begin to bounce back now I'll cover exactly how much you can make from this in the next few minutes but first we we have to talk about number two real estate even though every area is different and some locations might continue to flourish housing declines on a national level are actually incredibly rare in fact as you can see throughout the last 60 years there have only ever been a few times where prices meaningfully fell more than 10 percent but now the general Wall Street consensus is that National housing prices are going to decline seven percent with a worst case decline of 10 to 15 percent should interest rates continue to increase of course every Market is going to be different and according to Moody's Analytics the most vulnerable markets could see upwards of a 25 decline from the peak including parts of Florida Arizona Idaho and Southern California with the decline lasting another 12 to 18 months before bottoming out now in the big picture it's probably not going to make that big of a difference for anybody with a fixed rate mortgage who intends to stay in their property for another five to ten years but for anyone looking to invest or buy a house we may begin to see some deals starting to come on the market which we'll cover shortly because we have to also talk about third cash clearly up until now there's been this mindset that cash is wasting away to inflation but when every other asset is falling in price sometimes cash could be the safest place to store your wealth and you know that's significant when someone like the billionaire Ray dalio admits that cash is no longer trash the truth is many people forget that as recent as 2018 cash was the best performing asset and had you just been saving your money in a high-yield savings account you would have far outpaced the market cash is now becoming such a significant part of the portfolio that even fund managers are holding on to the highest amount of cash since 2001 and Citigroup said that cash is the only asset that investors could use as a recession hatch but as far as what you could do about this to make money and why so many people never take advantage of what's about to come here's what you need to know all right so in terms of why this next recession could be a once in a generation opportunity just to consider this first everything becomes less expensive the way I see it even though one person might think this is a bad time to invest everything is falling 30 percent a wealthy person would see this as an opportunity to be able to buy those exact same companies for a 30 discount Warren Buffett really had the perfect analogy for this he said when hamburger prices go down in price we sing when hamburgers go up in price we weep for most people it's the same thing with everything in life that they're buying except for stocks when stocks go down and you can get more for your money people don't like them anymore so first reframe your belief because a falling Market could work to your advantage the second there's less competition the fact is when times are difficult companies scale back they fold they can serve cash and they play it safe but this opens the door for smaller more aggressive companies to stand out and take their place for example one study across 16 000 companies found that those who continue to advertise increase their value and got more bang for the buck with Positive Growth years after the recession ended the third there's way more opportunity in a way a recession is the Market's method of weeding out the week and Patrick met David made a fantastic comparison a few months ago that the peak of the market cycle is exactly like a forest this means that only the largest most established trees or companies get access to all the resources or in this case sunlight everything at the bottom has a difficult time being able to compete and it's hard to grow but just like natural forest fires our economy has a way of repeatedly clearing out and bankrupting the companies who no longer are able to sustain themselves giving opportunities for newer smaller businesses to continue to develop and fourth after every bear Market comes a bull market as Yahoo finance points out historically the S&P500 has fallen an average of 29 around a recession with a median drop of 24 but once stocks have found their low their average return the following year is 40 percent and within two years the market has increased an average of 58 percent this means that investing in the way down is much more profitable than pulling out of the market and waiting and long term the market is always recovered in every single example so far throughout history and finally fifth you have to act before anyone else knows about it""]"

today's lesson of the day in our last lesson we continued our module on how to play stock trades with a look at position sizing and how to buy and sell stocks in today's lesson I'm going to continue this discussion with a look at the most basic type of order that traders used to enter and exit the market a market order so let's get started today's electronic platforms give traders many options for entering and exiting trades which include the ability to tie automatic trade parameters to your stock trades so that they will be executed only if certain conditions are met the most basic order type that a trader can use to enter and exit the market is what is known as a market order a market order is an order that is sent to be executed at the current market price regardless of what that price is when your order is executed the advantage of using a market order is that you are pretty much guaranteed to be filled on your order regardless of how fast the market is moving the disadvantage is that you do not know where your order will end up being filled until after you receive confirmation from your broker of the fill price it is important for traders to understand that just because they click to buy or sell at a certain rate on their platform this does not mean that they will be executed at that price the difference between the price a trader clicks to buy or sell a stock and the price that they are filled at on their trade is called slippage factors including the volatility or amount of price movement in the market at the time the order is placed the time of day the trader is trading and how active the stock is that they have chosen to trade affect the quality of execution that a trader will receive on their orders in general the more active the overall market is and the greater the amount of volume traded in a stock on average the more liquid a stock is and the better execution or fill a trader can expect now that we understand this let's log into a thinkorswim demo accounts and place our first stock trade using a market order if you've not registered for and downloaded a thinkorswim demo account I encourage you to hit the pause button and click the demo registration link above this video so you can download the platform and follow along as well once you have logged into the platform go to the trade page and type the ticker symbol for Microsoft MSFT under where it says symbol and then + press enter this will populate the trade tab with the quote from Microsoft for this example we are going to say that we feel the that Microsoft is going to trade higher so since we would want to buy in this scenario we're going to click on the ask price once you do this the order entry box will appear at the bottom of the platform which will automatically be populated with the default parameters for stock trades looking across the window from left to right you can see that the window is set to buy 100 shares of Microsoft stock if we wanted to change the quantity you can simply use the up or down arrows on the right-hand side of the quantity column to move in increments of 100 or you can type in the amount that you'd like to trade for this example we're going to trade 100 shares the expiration strike and Link columns are not relevant for this type of trade so you can ignore those under the order column it is currently set to execute a limit order which we are going to learn about in our next lesson since we want to send in order to be executed at the best price available in the market we're going to use the drop-down menu to change that to read market under the rules column it should say day which means that the order will be executed based on the thinkorswim normal market hours execution rules leave this set today for now as we will cover this option in more detail in a later lesson once you have all the parameters of the order window how you want them click on the confirm and send button this will bring up the order confirmation window where you can check all the details of the trade one more time before sending the order once you've confirmed that everything is correct click the send button to execute the trade after doing this the order will show up in the order book at the bottom of the platform as a working order and normally in less than a second the oil will show as filled in the order book you've just executed a by market order for 100 shares of Microsoft stock on your paper trading account and can now monitor the trade either from the trade page monitor page of the platform or account tab that's our lesson for today in our next lesson we learn to place trades at a specific price instead of the best price in the market"", ""so I'm not interested in trying to capture a Buy trade from here because we could very well see something like this and a continuation down for that reason I want some added confirmation of waiting for this level of resistance to be broken before I decide okay we could see this reversal and we could see prices continue to head higher so that's what I'm waiting for at this point and that's what I was thinking preemptively before placing this exact trade let's push prices forward as you can see just one candle later we do in fact break and close Above This level now at this point for this reversal setup in this reversal strategy you're learning today at this point I'm waiting for a pullback and a Candlestick pattern we'll break that down a little more when we go through the CEST the full strategy rules for this but just know that that's what I'm waiting for at this point and as you can see if we continue pushing forward here we end up getting exactly that we get the push up from our support level the breaking close above the previous level of resistance a pullback and a nice engulfing candle right here now for me that was enough to enter the trade I ended up getting involved a couple of candles later when I actually saw this trade and what I'm going to do now is play you a clip from me exiting this trade live so here we are back on the pound Swizz as you can see right here is where I exited this trade and that was for about a two to one reward to risk ratio so now let's break this down using c e s t as I stated before this stands for conditions the entry you're going to use the stop loss you're going to use and the target you're going to use for veterans of the channel you've heard me say this about a thousand times but if you're new here to the trading Channel anytime you place a trade you need to have set rules for each of these you need to understand and know the conditions you were using were you using supply and demand where you're using support and resistance where you're using a specific indicator what were your rules did we need to be above a moving average did we need to pull back to a previous level of resistance all of that would be examples of conditions you need to know exactly where you're going to be entering the trade why did you press the buy button was it because of something like this engulfing candle for me that was my reasoning that was my actual entry and you always want to know where you're getting out if you're wrong and where you're going to get out if you're right on the trade that's known as stops and targets so let's break this trade down and break down this entire strategy using CEST so first off I need to see prices break above a previous level of resistance in a reversal manner what I mean by that is prices need to have been pushing lower making new lower highs and lower lows"", ""but that's the thing we don't know what's gonna happen as I said earlier when we talk about the time frame it depends on how frequently you will trade if you want to make more than 50 a day the smaller the time frames the better like the five minutes time frame but you need to know that you will be seated for a long time to be able to make a lot of profits you're going to enter a trade there go up make around one percent gain but with leverage trading you can increase your percentages gains but we will cover that in just one minute here in these lower time frames when you measure all the price movements of the RSI strategy you're not gonna get these 30 40 50 moves unless you use high leverage which is even more risky so on average when you trade on the five minute time frame you will get around one percent moves but with leverage of 10x which I do not recommend more than 10x leverage you can get around 10 gains which is pretty nice for a five minute time frame if we switch over to the 15 minute time frame for example the percentage of the moves can increase a little bit in this case we will be dealing with moves between 1.5 to 2 gains but now if we switch for the one hour time frame we can start seeing some big differences because we're gonna be dealing with an average of between five percent to seven percent gains with leverage between 5x to 10x so we can start seeing 30 50 or even 70 gains which is just crazy if you trade in the lower time frames you will trade frequently and the gains are smaller but if you trade on the higher time frames your gains are going to be bigger but it's gonna just take a lot longer to play out and it's going to be harder potentially to make that 50 a day that we want to make now I use this RSI strategy with Bitcoin because you know I usually just trade Bitcoin and ethereum sometimes I go into the altcoin Market as well on the buy bit and binance and bitflix but you can use this strategy to all altcoins and even other Commodities as well if you want but let's be honest crypto is way more fun so let's stick to crypto and buy bit in my opinion it is also important to know how to use the right leverage and set up your trades here on the derivatives trading page on buybit on the right side is where you can start trading Bitcoin and make 50 a day you can first choose if you want isolated or cross margin under isolated margin a specific amount of margin is applied to a position and the position margin can be adjusted manually in the event of a liquidation you may lose the initial margin and extra margin added to the position under cross margin all available balances of the corresponding margin account will be deployed to meet maintenance margin requirements and prevent liquidation all corresponding available balances can be lost in the event of liquid edition if you follow my YouTube channel if you press the notification Bell below um you will know that usually in my trades I use isolated margin so all of my subscribers you guys know all of these things already but this way you can choose your leverage to start using your RSI strategy and this way you can multiply your gains quickly and make even more gains as you can see you can use up to 100x leverage which is riskier than if you use just 2x leverage obviously usually I wouldn't use more than 20x leverage personally you can use maybe 10x 5x as well that's probably more appropriate if you are a beginner if you are a professional Trader I think 20 25x is also possible there are also some strategies where you can use up to 100x but that's very very risky specific strategies let me know in the comment section if you want me to make a video about a 50 to 100x strategy that's how you can make money very quickly but on the contrary also lose money so it really really is important with a good strategy in that case after choosing your leverage it's time to choose if you want to place a limit order a market order or a conditional order in this case because we're using the RSI strategy every time the RSI reaches the 30 range we want to immediately enter the trade so choosing Market orders will be better in this case it will be immediately filled at the best available price from the order book usually I just make long positions but you can also short which I think is riskier but in this case you just need to make the opposite thing whenever the RSI reaches 60s or 65 range remember never wait for the 70s range you can start the market order in this case for a short position an important part when you're placing your trades is to put a take profit and a stop loss price you just need to set up your price the take profit and stop loss depending on the uh if it's a long position or short position in this case with the RSI strategy it's highly difficult to predict when there are I will hit the 60s range so in this case I will place my long positions without taking profit but you need to be with consistent

most years is positive growth but we do see some major corrections along the way the thing is we never know when these corrections will take place but if we just keep investing it really does not matter and this is also an important concept because the market as a whole is more predictable than individual companies some companies might do extremely well for example like microsoft apple amazon but at the same time many do not do as well investing in index funds is like investing in the us economy which i like to see as a really good company that has guaranteed growth especially in the long run and so as a result of this thinking a big portion of my money goes into index funds like vanguard's S&P500 vo etf when you buy shares of etfs like this you are investing in 500 or so different companies all at one time it's a very diversified investment that's spread out over many different companies i encourage most investors to put a good chunk of money into easy index funds like this and whatever else you can afford to invest should be seen as playing money so this is putting money into specific companies that i believe in and think will do well however the foundation of your portfolio once again for most investors should likely be index funds number three on my list is the important concept of taxes the fact is that most beginner investors they like to buy sell buy sell very frequently because it's more fun i get it"", ""hey guys in this video we are going over three stocks that Warren Buffett either already owns or would be proud to own I'll dive into the fundamentals and analysis of each of these companies and show you why they actually matched Warren Buffett's investing style make sure to watch all the way through to get an idea of why these stock picks could be very strong and also why they could be reliable growth socks that you can actually add into your own portfolio so we all know Warren Buffett the king of investors and probably one of the most influential people to ever live in the stock and investing world at 89 years old and with a net worth of about seventy billion dollars some would say that if there were a god of investing it would actually be him he's the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway which along with the terribly simple website fully owns companies such as Geico Fruit of the Loom Duracell and Dairy Queen and also owns a large percentage of companies like Kraft Heinz American Express Wells Fargo Apple and Bank of America he's known as a value investor preferring to invest long-term in companies with strong financials he's especially well known for actually investing in companies that are currently trading below their intrinsic value and holding them and building them until they actually reached their real value you're never gonna see Warren Buffett investing in companies like Tesla where speculation and potential future growth seem to outweigh all the shortcomings on their balance sheets and nothing used to be a large shareholders of the four largest US airlines he actually revealed as Lee's shareholders meaning that he had sold his entire position of US airline stocks he said that basically they just rarely sell portions of a company and if they do want to get out of an industry or a company they'll likely just sell all their shares and sell he did though he did end up losing a significant amount of money with the sale these airline financials just do not look promising to Warren Buffett and he thinks that even the current values of the stocks are not justified based on the numbers so here are some things that he actually swears by one is finding quality companies with a competitive advantage Warren Buffett hates buying companies that are not strong and he absolutely will not buy companies that do not have a competitive advantage which he actually calls a moat second is he says that you should invest like you're actually buying up the entire company now of course most of us in socks we can't afford to buy up a whole company so we're just purchasing individual shares however he says you should treat this like you are actually buying the company is it a good buy are you buying a discount or are you overpaying for the company so to do that you must also look at the book and intrinsic valuations third is you must invest in what you understand I think this is very important for a lot of investors because a lot of people just buy a stock based on its name without really knowing what the company does its current balance sheet and financials or the industry as a whole this really magnifies the importance of due diligence and that is doing your own research and coming up with your own conclusions and this fourth rule is keep cash on hand always have a good amount of cash available on hand in case investment opportunities do come yes some aggressive investors will actually not hold onto too much cash because they do want to leverage their money if you're holding onto cash that means the money is not currently invested and growing but of course there is a trade-off between risk and safety holding cash can definitely be a safer way to invest especially if you're keeping up to date with the markets and know what to invest in so let's go over three stocks that fit his criteria and I'll give you my opinions on each one as well as why you might want to add it to your own portfolio so number one is Apple AAPL Warren Buffett currently owns about 5.7 percent of Apple which equates to about seventy five billion dollars worth of shares this is his biggest holding in a company that he truly loves so currently Apple is trading at $299 and 42 cents with a 52-week low of $170 and 27 cents and a high of 327 dollars and 85 cents they currently have the market cap of one point two nine eight trillion dollars and a beta of one point one seven"", ""but it's important to make sure you're starting on solid footing generally it's best to only invest after you've set aside some savings in an emergency fund and paid down any high interest debt having three to six months of living expenses on hand is helpful in case anything unexpected happens and paying down high interest debt is a guaranteed return that's hard to beat by anything that you'd invested taking care of those things first also allows you to take the long-term approach to investing there are years where the economy is doing well and the stock market is up in years where it's down if you're only investing money you don't need in the short term you can weather that volatility and know that long term growth is on your side also if you're investing money you might need soon it could put you in a position where you have to sell investments at a loss because you need to make a mortgage payment or pay a medical bill and nobody wants that that's all to say that temperament is key it is the most important thing when it comes to investing if you're going into things with the right mindset you can go ahead and open a brokerage account now choosing where to open a brokerage account will largely depend on what you're interested in investing in though it's hard to go wrong with the major discount brokers and major institutions like Vanguard if you want to run down of the major brokers check the description for a link of our broker Center opening a brokerage account is typically a quick and painless process that you can do in a matter of minutes you can easily fund your brokerage account via an EFT transfer by mailing a check or wiring money there are a couple things to keep in mind them first determine what kind of brokerage account you need for most people that are starting out this means choosing between a standard brokerage account or an individual retirement account the main consideration here is why you're investing and how easily you want to be able to access your money if you want easy access or are just investing for a rainy day you'll probably want a standard brokerage account on the other hand if your goal is to build up a retirement nest egg and IRA is a great way to go these accounts come in two varieties traditional or Roth traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax money which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute but the money you take retirement will be taxed Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars so there's no immediate tax benefit but you can withdraw the money tax-free in retirement if you're thinking in years go with the standard brokerage account if you're thinking in decades it might make sense to start an individual retirement account the great thing is you don't have to choose you can do both as long as you continue to save money and both account types will allow you to buy stocks mutual funds bonds and ETFs so that's what you need to start investing now on to what you can invest in when most people think investing they think stocks and bonds it's what they hear all the time in the news so we're gonna quick define both of them a stock is an equity stake in a business owning a share of a company means you're a part owner and you're entitled to a sliver of the company's profits if the business succeeds you enjoy your stake in the business being worth more a bond is really depth if you buy a bond you're loaning a sum of money to the issuer for a predetermined period of time in exchange the issuer promises to make regular interest payments at a predetermined rate until the bond comes due and then repay what you lent them upon maturity there are other ways to invest but stocks and bonds are generally the most common now you can put your money to work in stocks and bonds in several different ways you can buy individual stocks and bonds mutual funds that hold stocks and bonds and ETFs that holds Docs and bonds we're going to explore all three options and talk about the pros and cons of each one of the most popular investing vehicles out there is the mutual fund mutual funds are a collection of stocks bonds or other securities that investors can buy a share of and they're wildly popular because rather than having to choose individual stocks or bonds a single mutual fund can instantly give you a well diversified set of investments you can find mutual funds that invest in stocks bonds as well as other types of investments such as commodities within each category there are a variety of sub types such as growth stocks value stocks international stocks and a variety of risk levels if there's something you're interested in investing in there's probably a mutual fund for you most funds are available to all investors even those who only have modest amounts to invest which increases investing access for many beyond that basic definition if nothing else the thing you need to know about mutual funds is that they're actively managed mutual funds and index funds we generally prefer the latter actively managed funds have a manager who's trying to follow a specific strategy to try and provide superior returns unfortunately many of them don't succeed most research shows that due to short-term mindsets active trading and high fees actively managed funds tend to put up worse returns than the major stock market indices like the S&P 500 that's why many investors like us prefer to put our money into index funds an index fund managers job is to simply match the index the fund tracks which takes significantly less time and effort than the analysis and portfolio management involved with actively managed funds because of that index funds typically have significantly lower costs and are virtually guaranteed to match the long-term performance of their underlying index if you're interested in mutual funds be sure to keep an eye on the returns over the one three and five year period and how they compare to the S&P 500 or the funds relevant benchmark you should also look at the funds expense ratio basically how much you have to pay the person managing the fund if it's high the fund better be putting up better returns than the S&P 500 or its relevance benchmark net of fees mutual funds are great for beginners they allow you to instantly be diversified and you'll earn returns that beat most professional investors for example the sp500 mutual funds like the Vanguard V FedEx have allowed folks like you and me to instantly own a piece of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US enjoy annualized returns of 10 percent per year and pay very little to get started another very popular investing option for folks is the ETF or exchange-traded fund ETFs and mutual funds are basically siblings mutual funds are offered directly through mutual fund companies and many brokers also offer access to certain index mutual funds in their brokerage accounts ETFs trade directly on stock exchanges allowing anyone with a brokerage account to buy or sell shares at any point when the stock market is open for trade like mutual funds there are thousands of ETFs out there so it's important to understand what you're looking at when you're looking to buy the important metrics are also very similar to mutual funds if you want to look at your performance and your fees each ETF publishes an annual expense ratio which represents the percentage of the total fund assets that goes towards covering the cost that the ETF incurs every year smaller expense ratios mean more money staying in your pocket and the biggest and most efficient ETF providers have expense ratios for their funds that can be less than 0.1% some - ETFs are worth paying for but only because their returns beat their benchmark even when you factor in those fees if you're new to investing ETFs are a great place to start because they're widely available across brokerages and unlike some mutual funds there generally aren't account minimums associated with buying them ETFs and mutual funds allow the average investor to easily and cheaply be invested and diversified buying baskets of stocks and bonds at once rather than picking and choosing them one by one and because of that they are one of the best tools for new investors but they are not the only options most of us are used to borrowing money in some capacity whether it's mortgage on our homes or bumming a few bucks off a friend when we realize we've left our cash at home just as borrowing is a part of life for everyday people it's a practice companies and municipalities uphold as well even the federal government does it how by issuing bonds bonds come in several varieties corporate municipal and government though their nuances might differ they're all generally the same debt instruments used to raise money when an organization issues a bond it asks for a certain investment of money it then promises to pay back that investment plus interest over a specified period of time for example you might buy a 10 year $10,000 bond paying 3 percent Interest the issuer in exchange will promise to pay you interest on that $10,000 every six months and then return your $10,000 after 10 years there are two ways to make money by investing the bonds the first is to hold the bonds until their maturity date and collect interest payments on them bond interest is usually paid twice a year the second way to profit from bonds is to sell them at a price that's higher than what you pay initially for example if you buy $10,000 worth of bonds at face value meaning you paid $10,000 then sell them at $11,000 when their market value increases you can pocket the $1,000 difference stocks and ETFs are traded on public exchanges so they're fairly easy to buy and sell now bonds on the other hand aren't traded publicly but rather trade over-the-counter which means that investors must buy them from brokers the problem with the system is that because bond transactions don't occur in a centralized location investors can have a harder time knowing whether they're getting our price the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or FINRA regulates the bond market to some extent by posting transaction prices as that data becomes available but investors can sometimes experience a lag in getting that information this isn't a reason not to buy bonds but it's something to be aware of when it comes to bonds the things you want to focus on are the bond rating now this is a score of sorts that measures the financial strength of the entity issuing the bond there are three major bond rating agencies Standard & Poor's Moody's and Fitch and these agencies use a combination of letters numbers and symbols to indicate the creditworthiness of bond issuers ratings tend to follow the general grading system days are great and everything else that follows is professedly worse generally speaking the higher a bonds rating the safer it is as an investment but higher rated bonds also tend to offer lower interest rates than bonds with lower ratings and that's because investors are rewarded for taking on additional risk although bonds are generally considered a lower risk investment than stocks they are by no means risk-free all it takes is for a bond issuer to default and you as an investor will be out some money bonds generally offers stability and prick table income but they come with some disadvantages for one thing bonds require you to lock your money up for extended periods of time for example if you buy a bond with a 10-year term you're committing to keeping that money invested for 10 years and because bonds are a relatively long-term investment you'll face what's called interest rate risk when you buy them as we learned before each bond pays a certain amount of interest but what happens if you buy a 10-year bond paying 3% interest and then a month later that same issuer offers bonds at 4% suddenly your bond drops in value and if you hold it you'll lose out on potential earnings by getting stuck at that lower rate additionally bonds aren't all that conducive as long-term investments because they won't grow in the same way that's because the return on investment that you'll get with a bond is substantially lower than what you'll get with stocks consider this between 1928 and 2010 stocks averaged and 11.3% return while bonds averaged just a 5.3 percent return now imagine you're able to save three hundred dollars a month for retirement over a 30-year period if you load up on bonds an average that 5.3 percent return during that time you'll wind up with just over a 250,000 dollar nest egg but if you go with stocks instead and score an average annual eleven point three percent return on your investment you grow your retirement account to over 750,000 dollars and that's important because without that growth you'll have a hard time keeping up with inflation and maintaining your buying power when you're older we talked before about mutual funds and ETFs and how they give you access to hundreds of companies at once but what if you want to buy a specific company that's where buying individual stocks comes into the picture you can invest in individual stocks if and only if you have the time and desire to thoroughly research and evaluate stocks on an ongoing basis if this is the case we want a hundred percent encourage you to do so if not it's totally okay to stick with ETFs and mutual funds and call it a day this video is more of a broad stroke look at investing basics so we're not going to go super in-depth on how to pick individual stocks but we do have a lot of other content on the channel about that here are the important concepts you need to understand before you get started only invest in businesses you understand avoid high-risk stocks until you get the hang of investing and always avoid penny stocks start out with established growing businesses with market leading positions for example Apple and Disney are great beginner stocks they have businesses that are easy to understand Apple sells I products and has a software marketplace Disney makes movies media and owns theme parks plus they're growing profitable companies that aren't going to disappear overnight""]"

description now let's talk about the big Lido finances more ethereum staking news Lido of course being the biggest liquid staking platform for staked ethereum in fact they have cornered about 80 percent of the ethereum liquid staking Market"", ""but it's been proven enough for the world's largest investment firms to start accumulating tokens and coins as far as the security of the actual tech is concerned i'll break it down it's true that some blockchain networks prioritize speed over security and there are always hackers trying to alter blockchain code to try and make more tokens the good news is that the more prominent blockchain networks have been tested by hackers because they're almost always under attack the more computers a blockchain has validating its transactions the more secure a network is a 51 attack happens when more than 50 percent of the computers in a network are hacked or controlled by a group of miners or validators with bad intentions they can prevent transactions halt payments and reverse transactions allowing coins to be double spent now we've been talking a lot about blocks and chains and other tech stuff so now is a good time to explain just what the heck a blockchain actually is at its core a blockchain is just a fancy spreadsheet in the cryptoverse we call this a ledger the ledgers are cut up into chunks or blocks and these blocks are chained together in one giant file called a blockchain the giant blockchain of spreadsheets gets authenticated and verified so there aren't any double spins or other errors this is called consensus and it's a big part of what makes crypto so special consensus means computers are validating transactions and agreeing that the information is correct the two most common ways of achieving consensus in a blockchain are what's called proof of work and proof of stake bitcoin is a proof of work blockchain where specialized computers compete to solve complex math problems and are rewarded with bitcoin we call this mining the more people competing to solve blocks the more secure the network is new miners are incentivized to join the network as the value of bitcoin increases thereby making a positive feedback loop of network security of stake blockchains like cardano avalanche and polkadot are more scalable because they don't require expensive mining equipment or energy inputs like proof-of-work think of proof-of-stake like depositing coins into the crypto equivalent of a piggy bank users can store their tokens into one big piggy bank with other people and they're called delegators the person who keeps the electronic piggy bank up and running is called a validator the token protocol has rules that randomly select validators to add transactions to the blockchain which earns rewards that are shared by everyone who has stored their tokens in that validator so because major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum have so many computers validating the network or so much hash power it is extremely unlikely that they will suffer an attack they're just too many computers or a bad actor to control networks that suffered 51 percent attacks are mostly dead projects that have fewer nodes to validate transactions we've covered what cryptocurrency is and whether it's a safe place to invest money but what gives cryptocurrency its value well value can either be innate or acquired valuables like artwork gold or any other asset have innate value because they're scarce an acquired value is something like trust in a country's government like for the dollar or the yen but ultimately it doesn't matter why people want something it only matters that enough people want it in the case of crypto limited supply of certain projects coins can make holding the asset more desirable simple supply and demand there's also the key element of what the asset can do that creates value many crypto tokens have utility that gives access to platforms they can give holders the ability to trade and create opportunities for wealth building make decentralized payments and easy peer-to-peer transactions or act as a long-term store value speculators also believe that crypto assets will increase in price over time as their utility becomes more widely used so let's break down some of the different types of cryptos starting with the most valuable bitcoin created in 2009 by anonymous developers satoshi nakamoto bitcoin is the first digital currency designed to be a form of payment that doesn't require a middle man for financial transactions the first bitcoins were mined by home computers but as bitcoin mining became more competitive and mining rewards continued to be halved every four years asic miners became a more profitable way to mine bitcoin there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places smallest unit is called a satoshi after the creator buying small amounts of bitcoin is called stacking sats and can be one of the best ways to dollar cost average into bitcoin ethereum ethereum is a decentralized software platform powered by blockchain has a native cryptocurrency ether or eth that's used to pay for transaction fees making the price rise is ethereum games adoption the ethereum blockchain can be used to create and fund decentralized applications or dapps and other secure digital technology the ethereum blockchain's community ran and home to digital money global payments and applications right now the ethereum blockchain is proof of work and ether is mined the merge to ethereum 2.0 where ethereum will become proof of stake is expected to happen sometime in the summer or fall of 2022 crypto assets other than bitcoin are known as altcoins even ethereum although i would argue that ethan has become enough of a household name that it no longer deserves the label altcoin but all coins capture around 40 of the total crypto market cap as of today there are different types of altcoins with different use cases stable coins are cryptocurrency's bank account assets that are pegged to another asset like the us dollar stable coins are used for storing funds ramping fiat to crypto exchanges and trading crypto assets circles usdc and tethers usdt are examples of secure collateralized stablecoins that are backed by company assets and reserves utility tokens are a way to pay for blockchain functionality this means that ethereum's ether is a utility token along with cardano's ada governance tokens give holders voting rights for example uni is the governance token for the ethereum-based d5 platform uniswap security tokens are digital contracts that represent fractions of a real asset like a company recording ownership or stake meme coins are tokens that get their value from community buys and not fundamentals they're driven by hype and online communities privacy coins or cryptocurrencies that can hide blockchain transactions to create an anonymity"", ""so if you want to just spot projects that probably came about in that defy summer the explosion of defy which mind you cardano did not have yet cardano lagging in that regard but building such as solid secure decentralized infrastructure now this is what we're looking at defy llama you see ethereum binance smart train or binance smart chain you go down number 15 cardano now D5 is coming online working its way up and does it stop at 15 I highly highly doubt that I think cardano is going to rock it itself up into the top of this list and that's a that's a steady progress right that takes some time but we're getting hints of it right now and this is why we call it cardano defy summer and this is from a few days ago start of cardano's D5 summer propels it into top 15 blockchain by volume cardano has recently experienced a surge in its defy volume thanks to the emergence of more decentralized protocols in the popularity of community focused meme coins like snack cardano has climbed the ranks to become one of the top 15 blockchains in terms of D5 volume and you go over here to cardano and just look at it everybody look at this chart just all-time highs in terms of total value locks in cardano D5 look at that and so you see this too and you can you can scroll down in from a micro perspective on these projects and see for yourself what is actually happening you go over here and we are it's it's happening everybody this is the first time I'm mentioning this in a video snack and and I hope it's appreciated why I take time in covering these things in a video but it's approaching 50 Milli market cap that's something uh that I've been waiting for in terms of content creation but just look at this cardano based meme coin snack Dogecoin competitor and this is where things get crazy everybody this is this I've been waiting years for this I think so many of you have been waiting years for this we're talking about we're entering this cycle of crypto where cardano coins are going to be competing with and in their own sector right with ethereum coins and and all these other blockchain coins and here's a perfect example it's going to start happening in the headlines because of what's happening on Cardona right now so snack being compared to Dogecoin as a competitor and the markets need it the markets need new projects and new things to to talk about to going into this next cycle as well cardano is just it's the blockchain""]"

advice you can get and what you should consider doing instead [Music] before i hit you with the facts there's a misconception i need to whack if you came here looking for financial advice i'm afraid

to beat the clock you can use the timestamps below to hop just remember that watching until the end will help this video pop now that you know the plot let's look at the crappy crypto advice that's keeping you in a knot the first piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is a timeless classic and that's that you should buy a crypto when it's at or near its all-time high this tends to happen because you've either been led to believe that this crypto will continue to pump or because prices keep pumping while you watch and you start to feel the fomo and of course when you buy the price starts to crash and you end up at a 30 to 50 percent loss within days sometimes the loss is enough for you to sell especially if another crypto catches your eye here's what you can do instead start by assuming that if you're hearing about a crypto because it's pumping then you're already late to the game and are therefore at a high risk of getting wrecked next pop open that kryptos price on coin market cap or coin gecko set the time frame to maximum and see whether the current pump is sustainable or not if you're not sure then pull up the charts for that crypto on your favorite crypto exchange set the chart to daily and slap on the bollinger band indicator if prices are popping out the top then you're too late now you can learn more about how to spot the top using the link in the description the second piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a certain cryptocurrency because its price tag is low and that means it's going to make you rich if it gets as big as bitcoin oddly enough the cryptocurrencies that fall into this category tend to have the most militant communities and chances are that they're the ones who gave you this advice and of course when you buy the price starts to crash and it's only when your portfolio is down 50 that you realize the price tag doesn't matter so here's what you can do instead start by ignoring the price tag of cryptocurrency and focus instead on its market cap this is because it's the market cap that ultimately determines how much a crypto can pump or dump don't forget that it goes both ways next ask yourself how large this cryptocurrency's market cap could realistically grow i.e how much investment this cryptocurrency could realistically see and by when spoiler it's not going to have a bigger market cap than bitcoin or ethereum regardless of what the fanboys say if you're not sure how big a crypto will grow then check out the other crypto projects in its category and see how it stacks up against its competition primarily when it comes to social engagement and monthly active users if applicable you can learn more about crypto categories using the link in the description the third piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a certain cryptocurrency because it's being shield by someone popular such as a musician politician or an electric car company ceo what makes this advice so bad is that it can come with the illusion of legitimacy particularly when someone tells you about this crypto before it pumps and you manage to get in early eventually however the prices start to crash and maybe you double down and buy the dip once or twice before you realize that you should have gotten out a long time ago as prices approach zero here's what you can do instead start by being aware that celebrity promotion is a huge red flag since quality crypto projects do not require any marketing especially not the kind of marketing that explicitly targets inexperienced retail investors next check to see whether the crypto project being pushed actually has potential this includes stuff like a clear use case that creates demand a vesting and inflation schedule that doesn't introduce too much supply and a unique design that sets it aside from its competitors most of this information can be found in a crypto project's white paper and you can learn how to read those using the link in the description the fourth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a cryptocurrency just because it was mentioned by a popular youtuber similarly to buying a crypto because it's pumping this advice tends to be given shortly after a youtuber posts a video about the crypto project which is literally the worst time to buy and of course when you buy there is a chance others will see it as an opportunity to take profits and sell and then you blame the youtuber for your losses even though they told you time and time again that their videos are not financial advice and crypto trading bots automatically buy and sell the cryptos they're talking about when a video is posted here's what you can do instead start by realizing that you should only be using crypto youtube videos as part of your own research and remembering that youtubers don't always get everything right next check to see if the youtuber in question is getting paid to talk about certain crypto projects or holds the coin or token they're talking about as part of their personal portfolio as most of you will already know i do not do paid videos i only talk about crypto projects i personally believe in and always tell you whether the crypto i'll be talking about is part of my personal crypto portfolio at the start of every video you can see how my crypto portfolio performed in 2021 by using the link in the description and you can find out what my crypto portfolio looks like now by subscribing to my weekly newsletter also in the description the fifth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to trust the stuff you read on social media about a crypto project if you're a regular user of twitter or reddit you've probably seen no shortage of posts that make you feel fomo about certain crypto projects and make you feel fud about others sometimes these posts can be very convincing and that causes you to buy or sell a crypto at the wrong time resulting in massive losses or missed gains here's what you can do instead start by being aware that a lot of the people who aggressively spread fomo and fud on social media are either being paid or have invested so much time and money into a crypto project that their bias has gotten the best of them next do your own research to determine whether what they're saying is true or false pro tip if the information they're giving isn't publicly available or requires talking directly with a member of the team to confirm you're probably dealing with a coin you can find out what other characteristics coins tend to have by watching my video about that using the link in the description the sixth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to keep all your cryptocurrency on a custodial platform such as a cryptocurrency exchange or a crypto savings app proponents of this approach push the idea that these platforms are just as safe as self-custody and you might as well earn some interest on your idle coins and tokens when you're not trading right"", ""so i really hope you guys are thinking why is this guy trying so hard to get me to quit my job i'm not trying to do that there

for 20 years cool a nine point one percent you're left with one hundred seventy one thousand dollars still half of what you made on the real estate deal the other thing to keep in mind is if the market flash crashes in a margin situation your stockbroker can automatically sell your stock at the bottom in real estate if market values plummet the bank can't call you up and say give us our money back because you signed a 30-year contract that the bank won't foreclose on you as long as the payment is made so your ability to control more value in real estate puts real estate way beyond the returns of any other asset class that you can invest in and this continues to be true until you're a multi-millionaire and you can't take advantage of these golden ticket opportunities where you can get 10 to 20 of these 30-year mortgages and take advantage of this massive blow up in value in theory you could buy a property every year with three to five percent down and extrapolate this even more ridiculously in fact that brings up your potential for control which is another thing that can increase your returns in real estate when you own this $300,000 property that over time is worth 350 400 450 thousand dollars you could take out safer forms of leverage again like a home equity line of credit and use that money to go buy another property and another rental property so not only do you upfront control much more value with real estate but you also have much more potential to control more value on top of that you get a third benefit that a lot of people only value once they actually get into it once you start owning real estate you start gaining a lot of experience experience that comes with being an owner you start learning"", ""don't forget we have the tour coming to you linked below there are four reasons you should not invest in real estate the first reason you shouldn't invest in real estate is if you have a job that isn't super secure for example you might think oh I want to invest in real estate and be a real estate agent well guess what happens if the market collapses you now have less real estate sales and if you have rental property in your investing real estate you might have your rental income go down due to increased vacancies or declining rents which can happen in recessions you know that's a lot like working for Toys R Us and then investing all of your money into Toys R Us stock and then bottom line if you don't have a secure job it's gonna be really hard to weather the crap that comes up in real estate investing and that is the first reason you shouldn't invest in real estate the second reason you should not invest in real estate is you don't realize that real estate is a people business if you can't trust people you can't trust your agent your lender your property manager your contractor your circle of influence then you should not invest in real estate and look I'm not saying you should just blindly trust people and not verify you should always trust but verify but one of the biggest things I teach in the real estate investing course isn't necessarily here's a checklist for how to invest in real estate 12 steps to buy a house or whatever it's actually how to deal with people and get the best deal negotiate the best loan negotiated with your contractors your property manager surround yourself with the right people because when you have the right people you'll figure out how to make money in real estate investing the third reason you should not invest in real estate is you're nervous about debt and you don't understand the difference between good debt and bad debt look this should be pretty obvious bad debt credit cards cars things you spend money on so you can have more butter items right butter items don't generate income all real estate generates income and because of that income you could offset a lot of your risk when it comes to having debt but if you don't understand that or don't like the concept of debt you probably shouldn't invest in real estate because the best returns from real estate don't come from owning real estate cash they come from properly utilizing leverage the fourth reason you should not invest in real estate is you get stressed too easily look we told you that real estate was a people business and people tend to be stressful but beyond that you have to deal with crap you have to deal with trees destroying your plumbing system roofs leaking you have to deal with broken windows vandalism sometimes you have to deal with electrical issues broken appliances clogged toilets and some of the stuff is just overall pretty dang crappy and if you don't have the ability to cope with all the mysteries and surprises and the mold and the asbestos and the lead and all the stuff that's gonna come up you shouldn't be in real estate so if you don't have the time money or know how to invest in real estate you should stop being lazy you should learn quick notes since a lot of people have been asking the I'm over it at or know that it's gonna be a small group it's gonna be maybe 10 to 20 people at each of the next 13 events that's it after those 13 events I'm going on a vacation I'm taking a break"", ""but that's not the case with commercial real estate instead you'll usually have a 20 to 25 year amortization schedule where a portion of your monthly payment goes towards the loan but there might be a balloon payment due at year seven which means if values decline you might owe more on the building than what the building is actually worth and third as you you probably noticed interest rates have gone up substantially in the last year which means there is a mountain of real estate that's about to be reset at current interest rates and that in turn could lead to an outright property disaster for example CPC reports that 25 percent of all office building loans are coming due in the next year and with rates now five times higher than they were a year ago ownership costs are going to be going up substantially and if you thought that was the end of it it's really just the very beginning now I understand that this might be a little bit too detailed but stick with me because you're about to learn a lot if you're not already familiar with how this works commercial real estate is valued on three main factors one is the land and future development potential of a project two is the price per square foot that it would cost to recreate the exact same building today and three which is the most important is how much money that building is able to make for instance if you pay a million dollars for a building that makes a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a ten percent return if it makes fifty thousand dollars a year that's a five percent return and so on because of that when it comes to these types of Investments Property Owners will always try to maximize the rent because its value is almost entirely dictated by item three the yield and the more money a property makes the more it's worth but today those properties are declining from a lack of rent and they're facing some stiff competition in the form of treasuries see at the core investors are all about the numbers they just think to themselves how could I make the most amount of money for the least amount of risk and work well when interest rates were at record lows and property was earning four and a half percent real estate was looking pretty good because it was actually paying something that was better than nothing but now treasuries are paying about five percent even the most basic of savings accounts are paying four and a half percent most mortgages are above seven percent and that's making real estate look a lot less appealing because why would you buy a negative cash flowing property at five percent when you could get that risk-free guaranteed with a treasury with no work whatsoever this suggests that in order for Real Estate to remain competitive it has to offer a return that's higher than that that you could already get risk-free which is a really fancy way of saying that real estate returns have to go up combine that with the fact that some buildings are now seeing a lower rent at the same time that interest rates are about to be reset higher while office space season 18.2 percent vacancy rate and you've got The Perfect Storm for a commercial real estate crisis so is this something to worry about well let's start with Wall Street because according to Fortune they're running away from the housing market and a prime example would be Blackstone they operate a real estate investment trust where investors could pull their money together to buy a wide variety of assets from residential housing to Industrial office space to Data Centers to hospitality the benefit is that this fund could operate someone like a Reit except by limiting their exposure to high net worth individuals they don't have to be publicly traded and up until recently this fund did exceptionally well but like I was alluding to earlier there's a bit of a problem since funds like these are primarily invested in highly liquid Real Estate Investors are somewhat limited if they want to get their money back after all if your money is all tied up in real estate you can't just snap your fingers and give it back to investors when they want it so as a condition to the service they limit investor withdrawals if too many people want to get their money out at the same time and wouldn't you know it Blackstone is limited investor withdrawals for the sixth straight month in a row why you might ask well imagine it kind of like you bought a million dollar house with a thousand other people if five of those people want their money back that's not a problem because you probably have that sitting in reserves but if 400 people all want their money back at the same time you can't do it without selling the house so either place a restriction on who could take their money out or you have to wait until the house is eventually sold in this case though Barons reported that investors requested four and a half billion dollars from the fund at the exact same time this is also shared by Wall Street sentiment towards housing as well for instance Invitation Homes which is the largest owner of single family renters has scaled back their purchasing because they believe that no longer makes Financial sense especially when they expect the market to continue falling like office space in San Francisco which could see an 80 crash although before we go into the consequences for everyday investors we should first cover realtor.com's latest housing report because there is a lot of new information here that will have a direct impact in you and your wallet in terms of what's happening today they found that there are 48 more active listings available on the market than there were a year ago and even though that sounds like a lot it's still just a fraction of what was available prior to the pandemic on top of that they also found that no region saw an improvement in sellers listing homes for sale in April which means across the entire country there's less interest in people listing their home for sale probably because they don't want to give up their existing mortgage rate it's also quite interesting that the typical home spent 49 days on the market this April which is 17 days longer than the same time last year however homes still spent 12 fewer days on the market this April than they did in the average April from 2017 to 19 and this is precisely why the housing market is not seeing a huge crash like so many people predicted now in terms of which location saw the biggest price increases and drops research from Black Knight found that Columbus Ohio Hartford Connecticut and Worchester Massachusetts saw the largest increases well the sharpest one-month declines could be found in markets like Austin Texas and Provo Utah beyond that though if we look at this from the peak the largest price declines so far have included areas like Austin San Jose San Francisco Seattle Phoenix Las Vegas Boise Stockton Sacramento and Salt Lake City so in terms of what this means for you and what you could potentially do about this to make money here are my thoughts first of all when it comes to funds like Blackstone unfortunately this is just the risk when it comes to all things real estate frankly if you want to buy property it should almost always be viewed as a 5 to 10 year hold at the very least because selling could often take a lot of time and profit is not guaranteed depending on the timing of the market even if you buy a property yourself selling a property often entails weeks to months of listing waiting for a buyer paying a commission at closing and that's something that has to be considered before you actually go and make the purchase separate from that I also think that if Blackstone is facing these issues it's probably a sign that wealthier people expect real estate to either deliver subpar returns or prices will begin to come back down and that's probably why they want to take their money out and be able to redeploy it elsewhere where maybe there's more potential the good news is that not all real estate's at risk and there are quite a few types of buildings that are actually doing quite well like Bloomberg reported that vacancy rates for warehouse and Industrial spaces low retail vacancy is only 5.7 percent and hotels are garnering record Revenue in addition to that about three-fourths of commercial real estate debt generates enough income to pass bank's research or financing standards without any major changes and delinquency rates are still below what they were prior to the pandemic no office space though on the other hand could be the exception because JP Morgan warns that 21 of office loans are destined to go bad with lender is losing an average of 41 percent of the loan principle on the failures because of that banks are expected to scale back on their lending be way more cautious about who they extend money to and that's likely going to affect you or anyone else who wants to borrow some of the bank's money that's why I think if you're looking to invest in real estate right now take your time be aggressive with offers and think long term about whether or not a property really makes sense to buy now I personally believe that long-term real estate still can be a great opportunity but short term banks will make it a lot more difficult to get a loan and that's something worth considering unless of course you have a low credit score just kidding so with that said you guys thank you so much for watching as always feel

being able to negotiate is probably one of the most important skills that you will ever learn in your entire life because this affects the trajectory of everything moving forward so in terms of how you could use these strategies to put you even further ahead there's one more aspect to this that you could use to your advantage and unfortunately most people don't even realize that they should be doing this although before we go into that even though we usually talk about taking care of your Investments I'll be honest from my experience I tend to do the best work and make the most amount of money when I eat better and exercise on a regular basis in fact for the last three months I've made it my goal to exercise for at least 30 minutes every single day and our sponsor co-pilot was able to

guys so much and now let's get back to the video alright now in terms of getting one of the highest benefits from everything we've mentioned so far one of the most immediate things that you could begin doing right now is to either build or improve your credit score the fact is the credit history in your late teens and early 20s is going to help you tremendously in the future anytime that you want to buy a house get a car obtain a business loan and negotiate terms from the standpoints that you're a responsible borrower who's never missed a payment and plus it's incredibly easy but before we go into some of the tips to immediately improve your credit score I just want to get this out there that I was the one who learned all of these things the hard way point blank I grew up thinking that credit cards were bad that anyone who used them were irresponsible and as a result I just paid cash for everything little did I know that was complete backwards thinking and I didn't realize that until every single Bank denied me for getting a mortgage on my first property because I had zero credit history to be honest that experience taught me that we live in a world where your credit score matters a lot regardless of how much you make and save and if you want to effectively build your wealth while paying as little interest to the banks as possible it all comes down to this first go ahead and open up a free credit card with no annual fee second treat the credit card like it's an extension of your bank account and if you can't afford to buy something outright in cash you definitely can't afford to buy it on a credit card"", ""they either just make drastic lifestyle changes way too late or they just accept that they'll never be ahead financially which is not going to happen on my watch that's why my number one piece of advice for anyone between the ages of 18 and 35 is just to spend less money than you make i know this one might sound common sense to you and i but believe me it's not common sense to most people out there especially when you consider that forty percent of americans don't have enough in savings to cover a one thousand dollar emergency so the easiest way to get out of that trap is to cut back on your spending and get rid of any discretionary expenses that you might have also websites like mint.com and personalcapital.com are completely free and incredibly easy to use and believe me trust me when i say this the hardest part about doing all of this is just starting and just starting to turn this into a habit and a routine but once you start doing this the benefits are going to become monumental you're going to have extra money left over at the end of every single week and you're going to have disposable income left over that you can now go and invest with this step is really just about seeing the long term and realizing the opportunity that you have right now to begin investing as soon as possible these are really your prime savings years because you have the power of compound interest behind you so you may as well just take advantage of that while you still can i'm not sure if you can see ramsay here by the way but in the last video a lot of people were complaining that i wasn't giving ramsay enough pets so i'm going to give ramsay some pets here here you go and one of the tricks i often do when it comes to spending and saving money is i just think to myself if i don't go and buy something it's like i almost got paid not to buy it like for instance because i didn't go out and spend ten dollars on a hamburger on my drive home from work i just saved ten dollars which is kind of like i got paid an extra ten dollars not to spend it if that makes sense this way your brain almost starts to rewire itself and rewards you for not spending money because you act as though that is just money you got paid not to spend i don't know if that makes sense let me know if that hopefully makes sense now given that statistic about 40 of americans not being able to afford a thousand dollar emergency that has been fairly consistent among all the money related videos that i've seen where the subjects of the videos have gotten themselves into horrible credit card or student loan debt i've seen everything from tens of thousands of dollars in outstanding credit card bills to egregious student loan balances and otherwise just a lack of consideration for trying to pay those down as soon as possible and here's the thing i really believe that having any amount of unpaid consumer debt will grossly hinder your ability to build wealth in the future it's almost as though you're borrowing from tomorrow and the day after to go and pay for today if that makes sense so if at all possible avoid consumer debt at all costs use it only as a last case resort if something terrible happens and you just you need it to put food on the table or there's just no other option to turn to except for a credit card but do not make that a substitute for i can't afford to eating out with my friends every single night at nobu and malibu"", ""third all you got to do is put your normal expenses on the credit card just like you would spend any other day and fourth pay off your credit card in full at the end of every single month by the time it's due to avoid paying any interest frankly if you just paid attention to those four steps that covers about 80 percent of everything you need to know when it comes to building your credit and as long as you keep your balance completely paid off you'll get the lowest interest rates anytime you want to buy a house or leverage your money in fact most people don't realize that when it comes to buying a home having a good credit score could save you more than forty one thousand dollars just promise me that you'll be doing this if you haven't done it already it's so important and I'm sitting here on a Monday night at 9 00 PM just trying to get this point across to you and there are still people out there that'll watch these videos that don't do anything about it you know this is serious when I'm not asking you to subscribe or hit the like button or get a free stock Down Below in the description when you sign up for public.com because that could be worth all the way up to a thousand dollars trust me a good credit score goes a long long way and if you want to improve on the score you already have make sure to pay down your balances as much as possible add new credit cards into the mix and remove any negative marks in your credit report that could be bogging you down and fifth one of the biggest mistakes that almost everybody makes is not tracking your finances in fact this is so bad that 45 of Millennials have no idea how much money is in their bank account and only 24 of them are spending money in such a way that they could actually afford which is way less than I ever expected and that's got to stop first I'd immediately recommend signing up for a free budgeting software like mint.com which Aggregates all of your accounts and itemizes everything in one place second from there review all of your spending throughout the last 60 days even if you think you're perfect and you have nothing to cut back I guarantee that there are things in there that you have no idea ever existed and those are things that you could begin saving money on third speaking of saving money itemize everything into two categories the first one is your must-have non-negotiable spending and your second is the discretionary spending go ahead from all of those add them up fourth once you get that total begin cutting back in your discretionary spending that you don't absolutely need and then begin negotiating the mandatory spending to see if you could lower some of those costs trust me if you actually go and do this in a few hours you should be able to save a few hundred dollars a month without even realizing it plus if you're single it was found that the majority of women find irresponsible spending a turn off so get it together and finally six with 35 of millionaires saying that retirement is going to take a miracle don't forget to contribute to your retirement accounts as soon as possible that's because one of the biggest advantages that you have in your 20s is time not only can you write out any short-term fluctuations in the market but you could also take advantage of compound interest where the money you make makes you more money which makes you more money which makes you more money until eventually you're worth the quadrillion dollars and have a Lambo but just consider this if you invest a hundred dollars a month beginning at the age of 20 at an eight percent return by the time you're 65 you'll have five hundred and four thousand dollars invested but instead if you figured""]"

cryptocurrency like bitcoin for a long period of time you're going to want to transfer it from an exchange into a wallet i have investigated it and to be honest the relationship between wallets and exchanges is actually a net benefit to the crypto world overall but moving on the web browser is also a very popular platform for wallets to live as you might guess this type of wallet can be accessed

of you know anytime you make a deposit within a bank you're protected by what's called FDIC insurance which protects up to the first two hundred and fifty thousand dollars you have deposited in the event of a bank failure this was created after the bank runs the 1920s Great Depression as a way to incentivize people to re-trust the banking system and it largely worked since then FDIC insurance has continued to evolve for any Bank who wants to legally operate in the United States and the good news is that it's a fairly efficient system in fact their website says that you could get access to

now typically in cases where deposits exceed the FDIC limit losses are recovered in a bankruptcy court when assets are sold off to pay their creditors but his bank rate explains that process could take several years to complete and more than likely their customers are not going to receive all of their money back from what they started with although to me that isn't even the worst of it instead it's just how far this is about to reach over the coming few days and weeks and I have a feeling this is really only the tip of the iceberg for those in aware Silicon Valley Bank isn't just a bank for the average person they're the bank for a significant portion of venture-backed companies throughout the United States and when those businesses keep a significant portion or even all of their money with one institution they could be completely wiped out overnight the reality is many of these institutions have raised millions or even tens of millions of dollars with the expectation that that's going to be enough to last them throughout these next few years those businesses have carefully saved money kept it liquid for emergencies and have spent it wisely only to have it reduced to 250 000 overnight from that perspective this is going to be crippling to every single business that banks with Silicon Valley Bank especially since they currently hold more than 342 billion dollars worth of customer funds now realistically a startup is not going to lose all their money with the bank and it's not like every dollar over 250 000 is suddenly worth zero but it could take years to recover whatever's left and whether or not the company has enough money to stay afloat in the meantime is completely up in the air I would venture to say that most of them cannot just consider that everything from payroll company expenditures and all of their overheads could be held in One bank and 250 000 could be a drop in the buck pocket for a company who had saved significantly more to make it through a time of slower growth there's really no way out of this with the exception of trying to raise cash as desperately as possible in a panic at a discount downsizing significantly or going under which is something that no one thought would happen just a week ago so that then of course begs the question could the same thing happen to your bank the answer is it's possible but it's unlikely the issue with Silicon Valley Bank was that they were in a niche market servicing startups and were funded by Venture Capital which was drying up that meant that very little money was flowing in a lot of money was flowing out and the majority of the bank's Capital was locked away in bonds for the next four years at a low interest rate that had declined in value essentially this meant that if the bank were to wait long enough they would have enough cash on hand and potentially absorb the short-term losses but when everyone begins withdrawing all of their money all at the exact same time the bank is left with no other choice other than to shut down now sure in essence every every single Bank operates this way and is only required to keep 10 percent of customer funds on hand at all time to process withdrawals but in Silicon Valley Bank's case they went all in on the bond market at the worst possible time at the very Peak"", ""and then there is the Bank of international settlements which was founded back in 1930 by the creators of the Federal Reserve this was done to ensure that their reign and their control of monetary policy globally was persistent across the world and as the name implies the bis Bank of international settlements it's the central bank for central banks decisions made at the IMF the ECB the fed the WF the Boe they all run through the bank of international settlements this is the banks piggy bank where huge amounts of wealth and power are being funneled to the wealthiest people on this planet this is the agency where shadowy banking families and shadowy banking cartels remain in control of the world's money safely managing foreign exchange reserves from their Tower up on high this is the banking institution's biggest proponent by the way as well of the implementation of Central Bank digital currencies the newest and greatest Financial threat to humanity which is being cooked up by globalists and we fully programmable digital money with scary implications the outline is clear create more and more debt so the banking cartels can print more and more money this is all part of how fractional Reserve banking works is how this Fiat system works one of the most valuable Tools in A bank's Arsenal is his ability to steal money from a nation without that Nation even knowing that's inflation that's debt and it's done by compounding debt on top of debt on top of debt most economies are ruled by debt since all the money of course is being printed out of thin air the debt ends up being more just numbers on paper than actual physical ownership of tangible goods or services and then of course the fractional Reserve banking system means that only some of the money that exists in all all of the bank accounts is actually backed by physical cash that can actually be withdrawn something like a measly 10 percent in the USA thus Banks take the other 90 of your money and lend it out to anyone that they deem worthy meaning that every dollar in your bank account is not actually your money it becomes the bank's money of course it's all the bank's money anyway at the end of the day isn't it the Fiat system is a scam it's a fugazi it's a system designed to enslave everyone via debt and to impoverish everyone via inflation and all the while this criminal banking cartel manipulates the supply of money to their advantage massively enriching themselves and impoverishing everyone else Fiat money only has value because we give it value it's actually backed by nothing most people don't even realize this there's no gold backing up the dollar there's no resources backing up the dollar just a trust me bro from the government it's insanity but this era of USD Fiat dominance could be coming to an end and when it does we probably have just three choices of what comes next the first first is cbdc Central Bank digital currencies such a truly orwellian evolution of modern Fiat and criminal banking practices combined with technological totalitarianism option two the bricks money this is a proposal by the brics group Brazil Russia India China South Africa other members coming on board basically to have a commodity-backed currency backed by things like gold silver oil as well as potentially member State Fiat kind of ish a return to hard money if you will that would be a bit of a shock to the financial system if it actually grows into a global status remains to be seen but still government issued money an option three of course Bitcoin Bitcoin is the only currency of freedom in the world right now it's the only free market economic money all the other options are just extensions of failed Central banking system policies all benefits the banks we deserve a free currency not a currency controlled by monetary mechanisms that are used as Financial weapons Bitcoin is the only truly free money in the world it's free from the banking cartels the influence of them they can't manipulate it"", ""and they quickly became a prominent lender throughout Silicon Valley while catering almost exclusively to venture capital essentially this became the startups Bank where CEOs and businesses would go for funding and for the last several decades that worked out incredibly well until recently and you're going to want to follow along in 2020 when interest rates were reduced to zero and stimulus measures were put in place both Banks and people were flush with cash and almost all of that funneled back into the banking system which is where things began to go wrong see Banks currently operate on what's called fractional Reserve banking this means that banks are required to keep at least 10 percent of their customers money available at all times for withdrawals just imagine it like this you give me your thousand dollars to hold on to for safe keeping but I could turn around to give 900 of that to somebody else who could give 810 to somebody else who could give 729 dollars to somebody else under this situation Banks hope that enough people give them 1000 dollar deposits so that when the first person wants their money back they'll have enough cash on hand to process that withdrawal the benefit to doing this is that this allows their customers access to a much larger pool of money and they're able to earn interest on their deposits but that also relies on everyone having faith that the system works and not all pulling their money out at the exact same time which has started to happen now to be fair in most cases Banks aren't lending to other Banks who lend to other Banks who lend to other Banks instead Banks often take your money loan out a portion of it and invest the rest in really really safe and stable Investments like U.S treasuries this ensures that as long as those treasuries are held to maturity the bank gets near the guaranteed rate of return customers could be made whole and everyone wins except in this case and here's why in 2021 and early 2022 Silicon Valley bank took roughly a hundred billion dollars and invested that into government-backed bonds with a significant portion of that locked away for three to four years at an interest rate of just one point seven nine percent essentially this meant that Silicon Valley bank took a massive bet that the Federal Reserve was not going to raise interest rates as fast as they did and when they turned out to be wrong that put them in a very dangerous position see bonds like this are valued based on their yield and in this case Silicon Valley Bank was on the wrong side of the transaction to lose a lot of money just imagine it like this as an example Silicon Valley bank took a hundred dollars and bought a two percent interest rate for four years as long as they could hold it for the full four years they'll receive a hundred and eight dollars and 24 cents back and be paid in full no problem whatsoever but what would happen if interest rates suddenly increased right after you made your investment and all of a sudden you could buy that exact same 100 at a seven percent return and make 131 dollars over this exact same four years well in that case sure hundred dollar two percent Bond would have to decline to 77 is to be worth what you could buy at today's prices and if you can't afford to hold out for the full four years to get your money back you're going to be forced to take a loss and that's what's starting to happen and normally Banks would have enough Capital coming in from a variety of sources to cover customer withdrawals but in this case Silicon Valley Bank's customer base or mainly technology companies which have seen significantly less funding and that means that their companies are forced to take more money out of the bank to pay for their own expenses essentially Silicon Valley Banks severely misjudged the size and pace of the federal reserve's rate hikes while assuming that the Venture Capital Market would continue to stay strong that left them in a situation where they locked too much of their money away in one specific asset that yielded too low of a return and that occurred at the exact same time their customers began withdrawing more money than they anticipated this of course is where the dominoes begin to fall on Wednesday March 8th""]"
10,9,141,9_moving_pattern_moving average_chart,"['moving', 'pattern', 'moving average', 'chart', 'average', 'line', 'use', 'indicator', 'trend', 'want']","[""so as we learned in last lesson moving averages or lagging indicators which means they tend to work well in identifying and following a trend but not to work well in ranging or trend less markets because of this traders will often use them to trade with a trend as well as to identify potential areas of support or resistance which may result in a continuation or reversal of a trend so let's look at some examples here the most basic way that traders will use moving averages is to identify and then trade with a particular trend with it or with a trend in a particular financial instrument so here we have a chart of Goldman Sachs and you can see here this I've got a 50-day moving average plotted on this and you can see here that this this moving average this 50-day moving average was pretty good at calling some very nice runs in the market so or for this stock so you see here the break above you caught a nice run up by trading on the break above that 50 period moving average then there was a little bit of a whipsaw there where you about broke even selling when it crossed below and then buying when it broke back across"", ""but what do they actually mean well these candlesticks are nothing more than a representation of price moving over a certain period of time a daily chart would be a representation of a full day of price if this was a one-hour chart and not a daily chart it would be a representation of one day of price and what they need to be recognized as is with a green candle the green candle normally represents an update meaning that this area here is the open the bottom of the body is the open this here is the low it is the low point of the pot of the candle the bottom of that wick is the low point of this 24-hour period represented by our green candle this high point is the high of this 24-hour period and this is the close of that candle so if this candle would have started at 5:00 p.m. and then ended at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time then this is exactly what it would look like if we had an open here price moved down from our open to our low price then moved back up to our high and then price came back down and finally closed right here that is exactly what these candlesticks mean that's a great presentation of a green candlestick or a positive day in price if you're looking at a daily chart a negative day is shown by this red candle here so on this red candle we have a very similar setup except instead of the bottom of the body being to open on a red candle the top of the body is the open the top of this wick is still the high of this candle the bottom wick is still the low of this candle and the bottom of the body is the close of this candle so in the representation of this candle what we would have seen if we were watching this on a daily chart is this candle would have opened here it then went to pushed up to the high and then pushed all the way down to the low and then eventually pushed back up to close that 24-hour period right there at the bottom of this red candle so that's how you see a candlestick and that's how that's how you break down the anatomy of each and every one of these candlesticks it represents a certain amount of time depending on the time period your own everything would be exactly the same if this was one hour instead of daily this was one hour then that would still be the exact same anatomy of a candlestick so now that we've broken debt that down a little bit let's head down to a different white screen and take a look at the four green candles we were looking at right at the intro of the video so now can you spot the similarities of any of these right now what I'm gonna do is go ahead and tell you the similarity and teach you the candlestick pattern that I never hear talked about here on YouTube and that I think is one of the most accurate candlestick patterns you can use for a buying trade and that is each one of these candles closes in the top 95% of the candle each one of these candles has either a tiny wick on it or no wick on the top at all and with these being green candles what that means is that the end of whatever time period let's just say we're still on the daily for simplicity at the end whatever time period we are looking at this candle closed nearly at its high at the highest point that the participants of the market pushed this candle it dropped barely any which means there was not many sellers at the end of this candle at the end of this period if we have little to no wicks on the top of these candles that means there were no sellers at the end of this period so that gives us a good representation that we could possibly see a market head higher from a candlestick like this and the way I defined this whenever I'm trading on a 4-hour chart I'm mostly trade on for hour and you can set a Fibonacci retracement like this let me go and show you how to identify the candle so you can take a Fibonacci retracement let me put it on my candle you can then adjust your Fibonacci retracement number change it to 0.05 percent and now all you have to ask yourself is did this candle you pull a retracement from the low of the candle to the the candle did this candle land the body of the candle close above the top 5% of the candle and if the answer is yes then you have a correct candlestick formation and as you can tell each of these do that so that's one way to spot this gamma stick pattern what I do is just look for the market to only have a 5 pip wick at the top of the candle or less 5 to 6 fifths is the max so a max 5 to 6 pip wick on the top of the candle when I'm trading on a 4-hour chart but you can also use the Fibonacci tool that might make it a little bit easier for you like I said grab your Fibonacci tool with the correct setting of a 5% top 5% of the candle and then there we have it every time you want to see if you are trading the correct pattern you can just use the Fibonacci tool and make sure that that candlestick closed in the top 5% and again if it did close in that top 5% then chances are there was no buying meaning excuse me there was no selling pressure at the end of that time period so chances are there's gonna be buying pressure in the next period and that's what makes this candlestick pattern so powerful now let's move on to actually finding a few of these on sharp data and then I'll teach you a full strategy you can actually test and show you my back testing data of that strategy right after we go over this candlestick pattern on actual charts see you in just a second"", ""if it and you know just like with the other support resistance lessons we've we've looked at if the line would have been above then you know that would have been a resistance line instead of a support line moving average crossover so plotting a longer-term moving average on a chart with a shorter term moving average in this case I've got a 10 day which is the black line and a five day moving average which is a blue line and then the strategy here is to trade when the shorter period of the five-day we would in this case crosses below you sell and when it crosses above you buy so again here not something you're probably going to want to use by itself but in conjunction with some of the other things that we've learned and some of the things that we're going to learn in the future it might be a nice complement to that so you can see here you got whipsawed a little bit there on the cross""]"

set the leverage here um and open uh limit order on ethereum either short or long and there's many other assets I think that's one of the major draw cards of games it's that you have many other assets to take advantage on so overall pretty clean pretty easy user experience when it comes to opening trades and that's why I like it and of course it will be on arbitrim soon so you'll have polygon and arbitrim that you can trade on remember if you do want to trade on games Network there is a link in the description of course use the link in the description if you want to do any trading and I'm going to try and get a giveaway sort of for you guys that actually sign up you just simply click on my referral link it is the first link in the description and you can start trading on G trade right here let's get into the Vault side of things because not all of you are Traders now of course one of the ways to capture exposure to games without trading yourself is actually via providing liquidity one of the ways to do this is via staking die in the G vault which is currently paying a 4.1 apy and is also now launched on arbitrum so you can do so on arbitrim or polygon as gains starts to roll out onto the arbitrant network as well if you stake die you are essentially representing your ownership in the vault so stakers of dire receive fees for each trade placed on the platform in exchange for serving as the counterparty to all trades obviously to power trades on the network they need liquidity so if you provide liquidity the people that are trading on the other side are using your liquidity to essentially be paid out and processed transactions if the Traders lose money the people that are staking to the Vault the liquidity providers they earn more if the Traders make money then the gdivault becomes less profitable but the theory is here that Traders actually aren't profitable and because the house always wins over time the stakers in the G diver will make more money as more people use the platform and there's more fees now of course there are risks where it comes when it comes to oracle-based dexes um and one of one of the major risks is that some kind of expert Point um or profitable trading strategy which wipes the pool be aware of that risk I'm just showing you guys the platform and giving you the option to stake if you are bullish on games and if you choose to do so I'm not necessarily saying that you have to of course you can just trade on the platform like everyone else but if you wanted to take it a step further and you like the platform and you're bullish on the platform then one way to capture exposure is through the G dive Vault the other way to capture exposure is of course through the gns pool which pays out to stakers based on how much fees the platform is earning and if we look at June analytics we can see that daily trade volume has been steadily increasing over time as well as users and obviously fees are represented in die have also increased despite dropping from last year but considering it's a bear Market this has been a pretty solid performance for gains Network and I think it's just off the back of having like a very usable product and I think it's launch on arbitrim that can also be a potential Catalyst to get more users into the platform and I think it holds it in much better stead uh long term being on arbitrim as well so of course if you do want to uh want to purchase DNS and stake it and capture upside to that then you can do so under their staking um section here you can buy gns if you click this button it will take you to Quick swap to buy gns you can approve it and then stake it as well and if you want to bridge funds across from polygon to arbitrim to stake on arbitrim they've got a bridge if you click on the bridge tab here which allows you to bridge assets across once again I want to make it clear that I'm not paid to promote the gns token or the staking my primary goal here is to show you

for this to happen but really a lot of it's about the decline of the US dollar over time and of course really of all Fiat currencies is going to be a major driving factor in seeing that go price go up and one world leader in particular he has had enough of the US dollar and that is of course Vladimir Putin he's been doing his best to build the yellow brick road toward a new Reserve currency created by a group of country called brics earlier this year he announced that Brazil Russia India China and South Africa the brics group are working on a new basket-based Reserve currency there's also interest from other countries who are also wanting to de-dollarize countries like Egypt turkey Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia one of the big wild cards here all wanting to join the brics group the issue of creating an international Reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of their countries it's currently being worked out and gold is part of the plan Putin said it the brics business Forum that we are ready to openly work with all fair partners of five countries are also trying to create an alternative mechanism for international humans he added the case for why the brics countries would use gold it's pretty gosh darn simple more monetary Freedom they want to receive a solid currency that they can control or at least have a larger sayover in return for their goods and of course to avoid sanctions so they can transact freely without the Western countries dictating their moves the head of ing Chris Turner said safety liquidity in return make a great Reserve currency which is why bricks could potentially look toward adding gold into that basket if they're worried about the path of sanctions and the increasing weaponization of the dollar they like Russia might prefer to move into gold now this could definitely be a strong possibility here Russia of course is the third leading gold producer in the world so as of course no surprise that over the decades it has dramatically increased its gold reserves it's also tell telling that these countries are already dabbling into the world of crypto and of course of Central Bank digital currencies these countries went out of the U.S dollar system is it possible we could get a gold-backed stable coin in the future in the forms of a brics currency certainly interesting food for thought and of course that's all happening at the same time that Russia is about to allow Bitcoin for international payments so it's a very interesting coincidence if you will now the second reason that gold could boom in the same reason the Bitcoin can boom and those other store value assets right is because of increased demand from central banks around the world you see gold does well in recessions as we see investors turning to gold for its perceived safety it has produced positive gains in five out of the seven last recessions now as fears have been escalating over last year central banks have been preparing for the worst demand for gold has increased all over the world from central banks and particular we're seeing huge buying sprees according to the world gold Council demand for gold increased by 28 percent in 2022 central banks have been boosting their reserves big time with gold almost as if never before Q3 2022 saw a 55-year high demand for gold from central banks with them buying a record 399 tons worth of gold around 20 billion dollars worth that's almost double the previous record during the same period from back in 2018."", ""South Africa was then subsequently added to the group in 2010 although the coining of the term brick back in 2001 was mostly semantics since then we've seen a stronger Alliance start to form with these nations working together in an economic sense to help Foster stronger global economic

Canada France Germany Italy Japan the United Kingdom and the United States has now started to wane indominance compared to Bricks as you can see from the graph in front of you brics dominance in terms of the total GDP share is starting to flip the share of the G7 as the brics Nations continuously gain power but why does it matter if these nations gain power well because they have an alliance and they're strategically working together to implement measures to better their own currencies Financial Futures but one of the ways that they are doing this is by accepting de-dollarization and starting to settle trade payments in varying currencies back in 2014 Russia and China signed a deal to bypass the US dollar they no longer wanted to rely on the US dollar for international trade and investment the trend is called de-dollarization we are witnessing a rapid shift away from US dollars in international trade we can see this because China's Yuan has replaced the dollar as the most traded currency in Russia China and France have even completed the first Yuan settled LNG trade signaling the end of the use of the dollar for energy trades we've seen China and Brazil pledge to use their own currencies to pay for trade deals and even Saudi Arabia is now entering a trade alliance with China Russia India Pakistan and four Central Asian Nations but the most crazy thing of all is that the brics nations want to develop their own rival currency to the US dollar now whether this will be a success or not no one knows but what we do know is that they're actively working on ways to develop a new currency together and we can see politically their Alliance is only growing stronger now this August in South Africa the brics nations are set to meet to discuss the potential implementation of a

the world's biggest oil and food and Manufacturing producers I think it would be Folly to Simply dismiss the idea of dedolarization outright or some kind of conspiracy as for example Dave Ramsey called it recently remember the only thing that gives the dollar or really any Fiat money its value is is the belief in its value and that is being questioned right now with the International Community the USA is 32 trillion dollars in debt that's a debt which only gets worse in fact the debt is so bad that now the interest payments are the number one line item on the U.S budget the currency is being debased at an incredible rate right now another eight trillion dollars could be trented just for the banking crisis alone now add in that the dollar of course has been used as a

fire all your bozos look when you first start your business you're gonna have a bunch of wingding customer support you're gonna have a bunch of wingding partners you're gonna have a bunch of bozos look at all your team and realized it probably bozos just get rid of them you need to find top-tier people that want to be there that will show up and work 12 hours a day without pay I'm not saying without pay but I'm saying like people that really want to be there they really love the business they really love the business and the vision and it's gonna be really hard to do that with your first business because the vision behind it is usually pretty lame the cooler your business is the cooler the type of people that want to work for it usually are that's that's another cool lesson right there but look at your bozos and then get really serious because you can do so much more damage with five really well trained people that really want to be at the business then you came with 25 people

your people and in order for your business to succeed you have to have a wonderful product the people enjoy and absolutely love that's the ultimate key to business you can have the best marketing on planet earth and be a super-famous what Shema call it you see how it works for certain people when they do that admit they never go to that next level I was in a business I was in business for almost a decade so far and while I've made money I built pretty good businesses I've never had a business go the true distance and by true distance I mean those 50 million hundred million dollar exits building a company where you have a giant building with your logo on the side of it and a staff full of wonderful people I've never built a business that's gone that distance"", ""and I can provide a unique service to a business or sell a unique product to people that are not being served at all how do you do this what you want to do is you want to go and look in face or groups of specific markets

specific type of surgeon and go and develop an app for them go and find some way to maximize the phone calls coming into their business find some way for their business that convert 10 percent more people find a product or thingamajig that would allow them make more revenue from their business you could easily sell it for twenty to fifty thousand dollars to them or even make an app that gets people on there and cost fifty thousand dollars a year it's not that's not that hard to do and with basic marketing you could probably get them too biased because no one's really offering this that's what I'm talking about right there so find edge markets and in find where their business can be improved a lot of brick-and-mortar businesses a lot of common business models that have huge upfront sales volumes or cost are completely wide open that's what you want to do first go and read what these people are doing don't go look in marketing groups and business groups and look what they're doing look at what other people and businesses nobody even knows exists are doing for example people that sell the bots that put certain types of packages together for example I had a friend who started the business like this already got into a business like this the business exploded and it had cavemen like sales methods you want to get in a blue ocean and you want to be know how to look for this next sales video copywriting I've generated tens of millions of dollars online because I know how to get in from a video and what to say to get people interested in buying something now the biggest key of all is spotting a market in a product that people actually want to buy and is unique and will deliver value to them the best way to do it is again talking to people in the market and really figuring them out that's the best thing how I created high risk I was literally at a mastermind I was listening to people complain and complain complain about a certain product about a certain problem they had and I fixed that problem for them all those people on the mastermind are great percentage of them are on the product now including all their friends and everybody else one of the main

A one or two year old car right off the lot or something like that for example. You can end up losing a massive amount of money by buying an expensive car. So if you guys wanna check out that video, I'm gonna link it up in the description below but cars are what you call a depreciating asset. The assets that you want in your life are appreciating assets like stocks and bonds, and real estate, things that tend to go up in value. While a car is technically an asset, most cars are depreciating assets meaning every single year they are worth less and less money and if you make this mistake of going out there and buying a brand new car or buying an expensive car you're gonna end up upside down on that car to the point where basically how much you owe is more than what that car is actually worth and you're gonna be stuck paying back this car payment for years to come on a car that's not even worth what you owe on it"", ""so first of all depreciation now typically besides this past year which is a total anomaly which was really weird uh you know used car prices up like 40 over the past 12 months that normally does not happen so we have something with vehicles uh where we have to take into account depreciation which is one of the biggest expenses of a car when you buy a car eventually it's going to be worth less and less and less every year theoretically just ignore the past year though because of supply chain problems so if we look at cars and and vehicles when's the best time to buy a car should you buy it used or new uh so if you buy a new car uh automatically as soon as you drive it off the lot you're gonna lose about 10 of that car's value so if car's worth 30 000 you drive it off the lot it's now worth probably about twenty seven thousand dollars sometimes even less simply because you broke in the car and now you know it's not new anymore it's a used car okay""]"

policy to limit losses on a trade to a preset amount for instance if a stock is $10 a share a trader can lock in a sell price for a fee and not have to worry if the price of the stock drops in price no matter how low the stock goes in price the option holder has locked in the right to sell his stock for a preset price and can also use an option for speculation for instance let's say hypothetically a stock has $10 a share and a trader feels the stock is going to increase in price for a fee he can lock in a predetermined price to buy the stock in the future no matter what the price of the stock is at that time if the stock is $10 a share now for maybe $1 a share he can lock in the right to buy that stock for $10 any time during the next month then if the stock increases in price to $12 $15 $100 any price the trader can then use this option to buy the stock for $10 and then immediately sell the stock for the higher current price making the difference in profit the third main use for options is a hedge to mitigate risk a diversified portfolio that includes options can be set up in a way that greatly limits losses for extreme market moves in addition companies sometimes use options to lock in future prices similar to the way they use future contracts there are many different strategies for trading options some strategies are very risky and come with large gains or losses other strategies are very low risk and come with capped gains and losses to a fixed maximum amount some strategies involve combining two or more options in different ways to profit in ways other than the change in stock price for instance options can be combined in a way to profit when the individual stock or even the overall market gets more volatile or less volatile but a profit when other things happen such as changes in interest rates for this course for simplification I'm going to focus on stock options only however there are options and other markets that work basically the same way options can be a bit confusing at first but after one learns the basics they realize that options are not complicated in the next several videos I will break down options in detail in a way that is easy to understand you"", ""okay now option two is that we sell the put option and here's how it works so if we were to buy the put option well we have the option as the buyer of the put option we have the option to sell our shares of stock at a predetermined price they call that the strike price we're using 360 dollars as the strike price so if we buy the put option this gives us the choice to sell our shares of stock at that price at the strike price but on the flip side if we were to sell the option well now the seller of the put option has the option to buy those shares from the buyer the put option they have the option to buy those shares at the strike price once again in our case 360 dollars per share now we know that each option contract has a strike price and it's going to be either a call or a put they will also have an expiration date that's the final date that the options contract will still be valid so for our example i chose the options contract the put options contract that expired on april 16th of 2021 and on the day that i pulled down this option there were eight that i pulled down the quote there were 18 days until that options expired and that price at the time was three dollars per share now we know that each options contract has 100 shares in it so if it says three dollars as the quoted price we know that we have to multiply that by 100 for 400 shares therefore this options contract is worth 300 now obviously we went with april 16th of 2021 just 18 days away we could repeat this process over and over again with different dates or perhaps we could pick one that's further out the further the more time on a contract in theory the higher the value of that contract should be so we sell a put options contract with a 360 dollar strike price that expires on april 16th and we receive the premium they call that the premium the 300 we receive that 300 right away so as soon as we place this order as soon as the order gets executed 300 we moved into our brokerage account"", ""[Music] hello and welcome this is the first video in a short series that explains covered calls if needed before watching this video you may want to watch the first video in my basic option series titled what is the stock option a covered call as a combination of two positions the first is a long position on a stock or ETF the second is a short position on a call option when one buys a call option they are locking in a preset buy price for an asset when one sells or shorts a call option they are selling their commitment to later sell an asset for a preset sell price therefore placing a covered call means that the trader is buying a stock or ETF and then selling an option contract that locks in the right for the option buyer to buy that stock or ETF from the trader for a preset price let's look at a hypothetical example to explain let's say stock XYZ is currently trading for $10 to share to place a covered call the trader buys a hundred shares of the stock for $10 a share he also sells a call option contract with an $11 strike price that expires in a month he is paid twenty five cents that share upfront for selling the option the trader has bought XYZ for $10 a share he has also sold the right for someone else to buy XYZ from him for $11 to share and he was paid 25 cents a share for that right if the price of XYZ is above eleven dollars a share when the call option he sold expires the traders obligated to sell his shares of XYZ for $11 a share he bought XYZ for $10 a share and he sells it for 11 so he makes $1 a share on the stock plus he was paid 25 cents a share selling the option so his total profit is a dollar 25 a share if the price of XYZ does not rise above 11 dollars a share before the option the traders sold expires the option expires worthless this means that the trader keeps his stock plus he keeps the 25 cents that he was paid upfront for selling the option as profit the next month he sells another option and the process repeats the risk for a covered called trader is that the price of the underlying stock makes a large move downward the premium that the covered called trader collapsed somewhat helps protect the trader against a downward movement of the underlying stock when placing a covered call a trader must choose which stock or ETF to buy and which option to sell on that stock or ETF there is a trade-off between potential profit versus downside risk for each option the trader could sell the trader must consider the cost of the option in other words the amount he would collect upfront the price at which the option is exercised in other words the option strike price the amount of downside protection that the option provides and the break-even point therefore the selection of which stock or ETF to use for covered calls and which call option to sell on that stock or ETF depends on the strategy and goals of the trader in the next video we will look at examples of covered calls I hope that you enjoyed this video thanks for watching you""]"

where they explained that they invested in treasury ETFs so uh tip CTS which is treasury inflation protected securities tips for short now there's a tips ETF that is the I shares tips ETF and basically the higher inflation goes the more yield we get the better the dividends we get in that particular ETF given how high inflation has been and given how bad the stock market has been well you would think that the bond market would be a good place to invest the issue the real issue is that Bond ETFs are different so let's jump into why so this is a chart of the returns of that very same tips ETF so each bar represents a single month and it's looking back over the past five or six years and basically what it's doing is if the bar is green this that ETF was up in that given month if the bar is read the ETF was down in that given month over this entire time period Well the total return was about up 8.4 percent when if we annualize those numbers that means we returned about 1.3 percent per year which is logical given where interest rates have been and what we would expect to return from a government treasury investment we would expect it to be low but we would expect it to be safe over that entire time period that made a lot of sense but now what would happen if we were to Overlay interest rates on top of this chart so this orange line is the Fed funds rate that is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve sets the target interest rate on an overnight basis and basically when you hear Hey the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 75 basis points this is the interest rate that they're talking about but before we go any further there's one important point that is going to make all of this come together if we are either already invested in a bond ETF or if we're thinking about investing in Bonds in general and that is how bonds are tied to yields so we can see that the yield the orange line is the yield the interest rate that is being that is being paid out by the government so the if the price of a bond goes up the yield goes down always that's the way it works assuming the yield stays the same assuming the interest payment stays the same and in bonds they do if the yield go if the price goes down the yield goes up the two act inversely so they're it's sort of like a seesaw effect now that's very important because if you were to buy a bond and interest rates after you bought the bond go higher well people are probably going to sell the bond that you have driving the price down and they're going to buy the bond with the higher yield so your price goes down because that's the bond we owe people are selling that more sellers the price goes down"", ""so why should you guys buy them right now well right now investors are largely feeling unsure or bearish about the current stock market so investing your money in shares may not be the safest option at the moment because of this negative market sentiment it seems like bonds and i bonds in particular are a really reliable place to put your money right now because yeah the government always needs money from the people but here's the problem the feds continue to increase interest rates which will cause bond prices to falter this is destroying the bond market as we speak for example the vanguard total bond market index fund admiral shares has been suffering heavily this past year on top of that we're looking at historically high inflation rates which also diminishes the value of most low yield bonds fortunately this is why we go to series i bonds to save the day and the first question that you guys are probably asking is why are series i bonds inflation proof so these are inflation proof because they pay you a fixed rate of return as well as a variable rate of return that changes as economic inflation changes too and what's even crazier is that series i bonds provide guaranteed returns which also essentially makes them crash proof this feels like a cheat code in the bond market but these assets are fully real and perfectly legal in fact they're literally sponsored by the us treasury so now how do series i bonds work before investing anything it's really important to understand what you're investing into and how it works so basically with series i bonds you're earning monthly interest that is added to your bond every six months more specifically you are earning a fixed interest rate that doesn't change plus an inflation adjustment rates that changes by annually now this interest rate can build up for 30 years or up until the point you sell at your bonds now before we talk about the things that make series i bond so great let's first discuss the disadvantages and trust me guys there are not"", ""but right now people seem to really like CIT Bank Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Ally Bank I'm not sponsored or paid by any of them to tell you this the second way to make sure that your bank accounts are actually making money is to put them to use by buying a bond now you might have seen some scary headlines like 2022 was the worst year on record for bonds even if you go back 250 years 2022 was the worst so why on Earth would anyone suggest buying a bond you see this is why I don't trust YouTubers that's a good idea you shouldn't trust them especially if they do magic tricks but in all seriousness bonds if done the right way cannot lose you money and this is because all a bond is is you lending money to someone else that's someone else in my opinion should almost always be the US government because the US government has never defaulted on its loans it has always paid that money back and once you loan that money out that Bond pays you into interest every six months or twice a year now every single bond has its own maturity date aka the amount of time you loan someone your money for and once that Bond reaches the full maturity date you get to get all of your money back aka the principal investment plus all of the interest that you've made from it the longer you loan your money out for the higher the interest rate will be but that's not always the case now my favorite Bond right now is the series I bonds which are tied to the measure of inflation or the CPI last year they were paying 9.6 interest which is insane so I put in the maximum allowed ten thousand dollars into it and now the money's sitting there and it's collecting interest I made a step-by-step video on how you can buy it from the government website at treasury direct.gov because it's not super simple or straightforward but the cool part is that after 12 months I get all of my initial principal value out plus the interest and that's why I don't care what this bond is worth on the open market because I'm not buying it to trade or sell ahead of time now if I don't want to put away my money for 12 months at the time there's a shorter term bond that is the six month treasury bond and right now that is yielding a juicy 4.8 percent which is still higher than 99 of any savings accounts that I've ever seen so this is a great way that if you know you don't need all of this checking account cash you can just put it away into the six month Bond and now it's generating interest so after six months you get all the money back plus the interest it's a win-win trick number three to start saving money really fast is to maximize your 401k employer contribution matches this is a 100 return on investment now if you're employed you already know this trick""]"

a financial pinch or in a position where you're not able to save as much money you're kind of wondering where you can start cutting back on think about cutting back on food that you're going out to eat because this is really a depreciating asset once you eat your food it's totally gone and you're not going to have any value after that so that that's just something that you do want to be very careful of how often you're actually eating out versus how much food you're making at home I can end up spending 30 or 40 dollars per week on groceries for the entire week because I'm buying the right things that I'm able to really stretch pretty far without sacrificing health without sacrificing the amount of food that I'm eating just by simply going to the right stores buying the right foods and getting them for relatively inexpensive amounts of monies so number two is paying for overpriced information now we could refer to a variety of different things within this point here one of them being online courses that are multiple thousands of dollars you're paying two thousand dollars for an online course or a digital program that shows you how to save money when you could just go to your free local library and learn as much as possible from that for totally free you could watch videos like this you can read blog post there's so much free information out there I just don't like spending money on education now college is obviously something that's very expensive in the United States that I paid quite a bit of money for but there's still cheaper options for college as well what I did is"", ""[Music] the average american household spends more than seven thousand seven hundred dollars per year on food expenses for most households this is our third largest expense only behind housing and transportation and if you live in an urban area food is your second largest expense statistically so we spend a lot of money on food obviously we need food to survive but how can we save money on food i save thousands of dollars per year as compared to maybe the average person on food expenses by using a variety of different tactics i'm gonna share with you in this video and it's not by starving yourself or or by uh eating at at some obscure place that you're getting like 50 cent uh food items i don't know where the hell is going with that so let's get started with this video i think there's gonna be some really fun topics in here i'll show you some of the actual strategies that i use in my kitchen might cook a couple things as well we've had quite a few requests for uh some some nate cooking videos so we might slide in a couple little recipes in there but let's get started here and let's start with the first kind of idea that we need to think about when we're trying to save money on foods that we're not spending seven thousand dollars per year but maybe getting it down to uh three or four thousand dollars per year on food expenses while still being healthy so the first thing we have to do is we have to plan ahead now obviously this this seems pretty obvious it seems pretty simple um but many people don't do this so what we need to do here is before we walk into a grocery store because we haven't eaten in two days and we're starving and we're just gonna spend like 400 on random food because we're so hungry don't go to the grocery store on an empty stomach this is like the first big problem but the worst is when people go to the store on an empty stomach and they also don't have a plan for the week so start planning out your meals ahead of time plan them out for a week i basically have six different blocks of meals that i line up four weeks and then i can alternate these weeks"", ""[Music] so food is one of the largest expenses that we have in our lives in fact it actually comes in at number three only behind housing costs and transportation costs so the average American household spends about seven thousand seven hundred and twenty nine dollars per year on food alone so in this video I'm going to show you some ways you can cut back on food expenses while still getting plenty of nutrients and the things that you need to keep yourself very healthy and so what we're gonna do in this video is I'm going to show you what I've personally done to save some money on food but still balancing that out with eating healthy foods I think there's kind of this misconception that it's very difficult to eat healthy for little amounts of money hopefully we can debunk that today in this video but we were actually pretty hesitant to make this because you know people have very different goals and agendas when it comes to eating food and nutrition and look I'm not a dietitian I'm not a nutritionist I'm not a doctor this is what works for me this is what I've done in the past I spend a little bit more money on food now as my budget has been increasing as my income has been increasing but I'm going to show you what I've done in the past and look everybody has different goals some people want to lose weight some people are trying to gain weight some people are gluten-free or vegan or they only eat meat there's just so many different types of diets out there that this is not a one-size-fits-all video what you need to keep in mind for today's video is that this is really oriented on getting the most bang for your buck when it comes to eating food so we're looking at the most calories we're looking at the most food possible for about 30 to 40 dollars per week and and let's just get started with this let's actually go over the grocery store right now I'm gonna give you a lot of different tips and tricks that you can use to cut back on cost quite a bit""]"

launching an evm chain I would consider this generally a bullish sign for a protocol that they're keeping up with the times and looking to innovate wherever possible let's look at the next Bridge step as we continue with assets over on kava now we can move to satellite.money selecting Cava from the origin chain and polygon from the destination chain we'll go ahead and move back over to polygon this time swapping back to wrap teeth here we initiate the swap transaction which is a five stage process signing first with our wallet selecting Max and then next and then approving the bridge transaction fee next we're asked asked to sign one more transaction in order to process the transfer once complete we can see a summary at the bottom and we have an option to make another transfer so here we are back on polygon we've almost reached the end of our massive bridging Expo but we've got one more step to go to put us back on ethereum it's going to be a doozy so let's take a look at this point returning to wallet.polygon.technology we're able to view our Wallet balance on polygon here we can see that our eth assets have returned to our wallet and that we're still holding the majority of them in exploring the different cross-chain protocols available for moving assets from polygon to other networks including back to ethereum in many cases the fee to return our assets to the ethereum mainnet nearly matched the amount that we were holding this was the case with connexed a bridge we didn't use this time but one we have used in the past we had similar issues when exploring new protocols where the ethereum fee took a long time to generate and ultimately was more than the assets we were holding situations where the preview amount was very close to our origin amount indicated that a gas fee needed to be paid in Matic at today's market rate this would be about a 95 gas fee this prompted us to return to Seabridge our original Network used to bridge from ethereum to polygon in order to bridge back the reason being that the final received amount after gas fees does not exceed the balance that we're holding and only uses about half of our resources selecting transfer and then confirm transfer and then confirming with our software wallet processes the bridge transaction selecting pending from the top right allows us to see the transaction in process once complete we can see the bridge amount reflected in our balance with our assets back on ethereum our steps are not quite complete our final procedure in bridging is to turn our remaining eth into native Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain here's how we do that using Thor swap found at app.thoreswap.finance Swap here we have the option to swap native ethereum for Native Bitcoin connecting our metamask wallet first here the maximum amount that we can select is adjusted based on the amount we'll need for gas here we'll paste in a Bitcoin address that we control normally we'd be able to process this swap transaction with limited fees receiving our assets over on the Bitcoin Network unfortunately due to the congestion on bitcoin created by Bitcoin ordinals we're unable to do this at this time as Thor chain has paused Bitcoin withdraws for the time being it's likely that new updates to the Bitcoin blockchain will fix this restoring access to this interoperability method going forward"", ""but we also incorporate some other Solutions and even more going on on the back end and we're going to try to dissect and explain all of it as we go keep an eye out throughout this video because when you see this screen that means we're about to enter another Bridge battery each bridge will be labeled with a number that's how many Bridge instances we've gone through so far we're also going to mention which chain we're starting from and which chain we're moving to along with the amount of gas and the type of assets needed to pay gas on that Network keep an eye out for these as we move throughout the Expo without any further Ado let's get started to begin with we're over on ethereum with some eth Assets in our wallet hit the like And subscribe let's go today we begin on the ethereum mainnet with 0.055 ethereum available for spending this is about a hundred dollars in today's money our first stop is seller Bridge here we have the option to swap between networks we're going to bridge first from ethereum to polygon processing a swap transaction and select and confirm after a few minutes here we can see the transaction pending on the Block Explorer once confirmed we'll be able to see the balance in our wallet at wallet.polagon.technology at this point we've completed our first Bridge transaction once the funds settle we'll be ready to interact with them now over on polygon for our next Bridge transaction we're going to be using synapse protocol over at synapse we're able to take a look at the available tokens for bridging unfortunately ethereum is not supported between polygon and Kronos our intended destination Network however using one-inch protocol we can swap for usdc assets and then swap them back to eth later on we also have the advantage of using the fusion router here the fusion router will allow us to perform this transaction without using any gas at all here we need to give permission for one inch protocol to use our eth assets signing a transaction to approve signing with our wallet here does not incur a gas fee once approved we're able to process a transaction swapping our eth assets for usdc on polygon once the transaction confirms we can head back over to synapse over at synapse we now have the option to bridge our usdc assets using the protocol here we'll select Chronos our destination Network specifying the max amount of usdc in our wallet we can initiate the bridge transaction"", ""so next stop we're bridging to ethereum l2s these networks are a little different because the ethereum that we're moving over will actually become gas on the L2 this is not true for the other networks we're visiting and because of that we need to separate out our Bridge amount from the amount that we're keeping in the wallet for gas we can do this by checking the block Explorer to see how much we received following the previous Bridge let's take a look next we'll be moving our ethereum between the two most popular layer 2 defy environments on ethereum specifically arbitrum and optimism navigating to Stargate we see that we have a bridge route available here here we want to verify the amount of eth that was received on the arbitrum side after moving from Kronos once verified we can paste that amount into our Bridge interface over on Stargate with the amount specified we're ready to process the bridge transaction select and confirm and monitoring the interface for confirmation after a few minutes we can see that our assets have arrived via Stargate to optimism like with arbitrum we're going to take a look at the fully transferred amount in order to figure out how much we're going to send over to Avalanche here we can see this amount of ethereum coming in through Stargate protocol a little bit ago before we can Bridge our assets to Avalanche we need to swap them for wrapped ethereum assets we can do this using one-inch protocol here we see that slippage is not a factor but there is a transfer fee involved selecting confirm swap we'll swap our eth assets for wrapped eth next we'll return to seller bridge and move the entirety of our wrapped ethereum assets over to Avalanche first approving wrap teeth for spending by seller Bridge once approved we're ready to transfer our assets again confirming the transfer on our metamask wallet once confirmed on optimism we just need to wait for the transaction to confirm on Avalanche as well again this may take a few minutes we made it that was Bridge five we're nearly halfway there it's a great time for us to talk a little bit about how these Bridges work now there are a few different types we have mint and burn as it's often called isonomes call it lock box receipt because because the lock box is where the tokens are stored on the origin Network and the receipt is what you receive on the destination Network representative of the value of that token the other model is interlocking pools of liquidity and that's what we see with multi-chain the protocol we were using earlier in either case though we're processing a transaction on both networks and that's an important aspect to how this works whenever you're bridging you need to wait not only for confirmation of the first transaction but also the confirmation on the destination Network once that's received our assets are available and fully bridged by viewing the black Explorer for Avalanche snowtrace.io we can take a look at our assets as they come through the bridge selecting erc20 token transactions here we see wrapped ethereum removing the filter we're able to see all the incoming transactions for this asset next using Wormhole we can move the wrap teeth that we just transferred over now wrapped eth.e over to Oasis selecting next prompts us to confirm that transaction here we need to select manual payment as we will need to process a transaction using rows in order to complete this bridge selecting approve will approve our current supply of wrapped teeth for transfer we'll select max amount and then next approve once complete we're ready to transfer our assets via portal Bridge select and confirm and then confirming again with our wallet and paying the requested fee once the transaction is complete and with Oasis Emerald Rose in our wallet we're able to redeem the funds on the Oasis Network this is the Oasis Emerald Paradigm an evm layer on Oasis selecting confirm and then signing again with our wallet so that last Bridge transaction moved our eth assets from Avalanche over to Oasis Network actually the Oasis Emerald Paradigm which is the evm layer now that they're there there isn't a lot we can do with them because liquidity is too thin so instead we need to bridge them back luckily we can do this with limited slippage let's take a look taking a look at the Oasis Foundation Oasis emerald block Explorer we're able to see our recent token transfers this includes the wrapped eth.e coming into our wallet selecting the asset wrapped ether through Wormhole we see that we're the first person to use this particular Bridge route in about a year and that there are only 19 addresses holding this particular asset for this reason it's possible that we don't have any other options for our ether on this chain without moving it back through the same Bridge here we again select the max amount before bridging back to Avalanche this time approving our Bridge deep assets again for spending this time by Oasis Network and then selecting the transfer option to complete the transfer finally signing another transaction to redeem the assets back on Avalanche next stop is one of the newest Bridge protocols on the scene squid router we haven't played a lot with Squid router""]"

but you realize is prodigio is by itself a trading platform so it is unlike trade-ideas which works as a window in the power reach raid platform prodigio is more of a trading platform there's options for a portfolio order book there's a quote grid there's charting inside there's trade vision trade optics RTS a strategy selection it's a very complicated system especially when being aimed at the

Waring here again with inform trades calm in today's lesson of the day in our last lesson we began a new module on how to play stock trades with a look at how to set up a demo trading platform with think or swim in today's lesson we're going to continue our course on the logistics of stock trading with a look at how to read stock quotes so let's get started for anyone who missed our lesson on setting up a demo account I recommend pausing this video and clicking the link above this video to register for a free think or swim demo so you can follow along as we go through this lesson for everyone else go ahead and click the icon to launch the thinkorswim platform and enter your username and password once you've logged into the platform you should see the trade page of the platform which will be blank one of the reasons why I've chosen to work with the thinkorswim platform is because you can trade pretty much any market that you would like well this is a positive that allows you access to many advanced features as you become a more experienced trader this also means that there are lots of things on the platform that are not relevant to us at this stage of the game with this in mind I recommend simply focusing on learning the areas that we cover in these lessons and leaving the other parts of the platform to be explored at a later time now that we have this out of the way we can go ahead and pull up our first stock quote stocks are represented by something which is known as a ticker symbol which is an abbreviation normally from one to four letters which represents the name of the company that you wish to trade the first thing that we'll need to know in order to pull up a stock quote is what the ticker symbol is for the stock that we wish to view luckily the thinkorswim platform has the ability to look up a stock ticker symbol built right in to get to the ticker symbol lookup feature click the two blue down arrows beside the symbol window which will bring up a drop-down menu with some tabs where you can click the lookup tab for the purposes of this lesson we're going to look at a quote of Microsoft so go ahead and type in Microsoft and as you're doing that you will see it come up in the drop-down menu where you can double-click to populate the quote window once you have the window populated with the Microsoft stock quote represented by the ticker symbol msft what you're going to see going across the screen from left to right is number one the last column this is the price of the last trade in Microsoft stock next in line is the net change column this is the change in price in Microsoft stock from the opening price to the last trade price the bid column this shows the inside bid price which is the best price at which the public can sell the stock the ass column this shows the inside ask price for the stock which is the best price at which the public can buy the stock the size column here you will see the number of shares of stock that are available at both the bid and the ask price in hundreds the number on the Left represents the size available at the board and the number on the right represents the size available at the ask when I say sighs I mean the number of shares available to be traded the volume column volume is the same thing as the number of shares traded in the stock so what displays here are the number of shares traded in the stock for that day in general the higher the volume for a stock the narrower the spread which is the difference between the bid price and the ask price next in line you'll see the open column this shows the opening price for that day's trading and lastly you'll see the high and low columns these columns show the highest and lowest price for the stock in that day's trading these are the main columns that you'll need to understand at a minimum in trading stocks other features which can be seen on this page by clicking the blue arrow to the far left of the quote window and which will cover the significance of in later lessons or the dividend yield the price to earnings ratio the earnings per share the dividend amount the frequency of the dividend the dividend date the 52-week high and low price for the stock the beta put/call ratio and number of shares outstanding level two quotes which basically show the prices in the market in addition to the inside bid and ask we discussed above can also be seen on this page by clicking the blue arrow in the next row down besides where beside where it says trade grid level two quotes are a more advanced feature that will be covering in later lessons if you would like to watch multiple stocks this can be done from the quote page of the platform which you can bring up at the top of the page by clicking the quote tab once you've done this click on the options button which will bring up a drop-down menu where you can select create new watch list once you've done this you can name your watch list click enter and then click under the symbol column to populate the watch list with the quotes that you wish to follow if you don't know the symbol for a stock you can right-click in the symbol column select symbol lookup and type the name and just as you would have from the trade tab another nice feature of the thinkorswim platform is that trades can be initiated from any of the pages where you have your quote set up so traders will have multiple options on that front that's our lesson for today in our next lesson we'll review position sizing and buying versus selling stock short""]"

Welcome to goodfinancialcents.com. Today I want to talk a little bit about why you need to buy life insurance. Now, I know life insurance is a boring topic. If I gave you a lecture on life insurance right now I am sure you would click away, fall asleep, pass out, day dream. I get it. Here's the thing; if you have a family, if you have a loved one that you truly, truly care about, then there is no reason why you shouldn’t have some form of life insurance. I was surprised and alarmed when I read the statistic that said over 50 million US households have no life insurance whatsoever. Over 50 million! Please do not be one of those statistics. Go out and buy some life insurance. How do you do it and how much does it cost? Yes I know, sometimes life insurance can be confusing. It can be an expense that you just don't want to have to pay because we have so many expenses nowadays. Let me reassure you of two things: 1) it's really easy to get a quote and 2) it doesn't cost that much."", ""we're not gonna get political here but my point is that I think everybody should be paying for health insurance or should have health insurance because I've seen some of my close friends or even one of my cousins who in their young 20s said you know what I don't need health insurance because I'm young I'm healthy and something happens and one of two things happens they either go to the doctors or the hospital and up paying thousands of dollars for this health problem that they have which they don't have that money so they end up in a really big problem or even worse in some cases is that they have some type of medical problem but they don't go to the doctors because they know what's going to cost them money so then they end up with long-term health implications because they didn't have health insurance now there's a lot of different types of insurance out there some people choose to not have insurance that's up to you obviously some people don't want dental insurance some people don't want homeowners insurance but in general I think insurance is a pretty good idea for most people for what I've seen and I feel better about myself going throughout my day knowing that I'm insured with pretty much every area of my life and it just gives me a little bit more peace of mind for myself that I know if I get hit by a bus some type of insurance is gonna cover me for all of my medical bills and I'm not going to go bankrupt from that"", ""so here we go number one is to share the risk with someone else and by that what I mean is insurance right health insurance is crucial absolutely crucial when you look at bankruptcies the number one reason people go bankrupt is because of health care expenses so having good health insurance easier said than done easier said Nathan yes then life insurance is the other one and as far as I'm concerned if someone is role in your family's relying on your income you need life insurance not even really a question about it you don't realize on your income you probably don't need it but if you're a parent or you're taking care of relatives or your you know you're a married couple and only one person is earning money that person needs life insurance and the person who is not owning one if your state home parent that person might need life insurance too so that there's enough money to replace and pay for the services that they're providing of course property insurance everything anything happens to your house or your car a big fan of high deductible insurance because that'll save you a lot of money that doesn't mean you have that some cash on the side""]"
33,32,30,32_debt_ceiling_deal_default,"['debt', 'ceiling', 'deal', 'default', 'june', 'president', 'house', 'weekend', 'government', 'decision']","[""but anyway look I think overall this this is all trending towards very good news not bad news so I'm happy about this uh looking at uh some other uh Capitol Hill coverage we could go to the hill or Politico uh let's see here um so we've got debt seal a debt ceiling deal appears to be coming in close this is a political piece that just came out about uh 20 minutes ago with it with seven days until the earliest possible fed default the default of the deal appears to be getting closer multiple people close to the talks told political that Republicans at White and the White House are closing the gap on spending levels critical part of negotiations Republicans are eager to show real progress before members hit the road on Thursday for Memorial Day weekend even if negotiations fall short of a deal despite the movement"", ""Biden and McCarthy they reached a handshake deal on the debt ceiling both parties are claiming success while many in both parties are saying they got nothing out of it carthy came out to tell the American people that this was transformational while Jeffries said it was an incredibly significant step towards protecting Social Security here's the bottom line the government's in gridlock Republicans control the house Democrats control the Senate so they have to compromise Wall Street thinks this is a good thing because they do not want any one party to Rule the Day president has to sell it to the Democrats and McCarthy has to sell to the Republicans to get a place of agreement there's a ton of reasons why members in both parties would not sign and would not agree because largely in my view after looking at the agreement there was really very minor concessions made on all sides no somebody was getting a lot out of the deal it kind of was business as usual in Washington but here's the timeline that we're gonna watch it gets kicked off on Wednesday the house is going to vote and then it's gonna go if it passes there to the Senate and those guys will have four days to get it passed if they sign it in that four day period it's then going to get rushed over to the president who's going to sign it into law if everything went perfectly that would give us the date of June 5th which would be next Monday for a resolution to the debt ceiling crisis we already know though that Janet Yellen has been out sounding the alarms that the U.S government will absolutely run out of cash early June and if we were to default she has said many times that it would cause severe damage to financial institutions as well as the general economy and on that note a recent analytics report said that a brief debt ceiling breach would slash 1.5 million jobs wow raising unemployment from 3 point four percent to five percent my first thought on that is well that would make the FED happy his goal is to get unemployment up to begin to put pressure on inflation and that would immediately solve that concern so you really never know what the powers that be may do in this situation and we also got a report from Goldman Sachs they predicted that the treasury will run low on cash by June 8th or 9th unless the debt ceiling limit was raised this basically means that the government is just barely screeching across the finish line to get this whole thing resolved now I have to play this clip by Warren Buffett on balancing the U.S budget because in my view it is timeless classic war and wisdom and it's spot on so check this out these problems aren't been mature enough for a president that's been mature enough to take this head off"", ""they can make more money number two they can spend less money or number three they can increase the cred credit card limit and continue taking loans out from the credit card because they now have a higher line of credit that's what the US government is doing every single year when this becomes an issue instead of raising expenditure by raising taxes or cutting the deficit by cutting expenditure the government just kicks the can down the road by raising the debt ceiling this debt ceiling then therefore becomes a political football between fiscal conservatives who want to cut expenditure and liberals that want to increase expenditure while also increasing taxes and that's the exact position that we're in right now there has become a showdown between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican house Speaker Kevin McCarthy house Speaker Kevin McCarthy leads a theoretically Coalition of fiscal conservatives that want to get the budget under control Joe Biden leads the Democrats who are much more inclined to spend more money and just raise the deficit even farther Kevin McCarthy and Joe Biden have been going back and forth for weeks trying to reach some kind of agreement that would raise the debt limit stopping the United States government from entering into a default just a couple of days ago speaker McCarthy tweeted this I just got off the phone with president obedico after he wasted time and refused to negotiate for months we've come to an agreement in principle that is worthy of the American people it seems that there's a last minute agreement coming through and there more than likely will be nobody on Capitol Hill wants to be the person that caused the entire global economy to collapse but the uncertainty of whether or not that will occur is hanging over the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and stock market like a dark cloud and for good reason treasury secretary Janet Yellen says a U.S default would trigger a global economic downturn and Moody's predicts that a default would lead to 6 million jobs lost 12 trillion dollars in household wealth evaporating and four percent of gross domestic products disappearing on top of that that would lead to a complete demise of United States treasuries which are widely considered to be the safest investment you can possibly make a default on U.S debt would be the destruction of the United States economy and would send shock waves through geopolitics for the rest of the century basically it'd be the movie 2012 meets the big short but the debt ceiling is likely to have an agreement rate Sean in the next couple of days and then after that comes through we'll likely see a rally on the stock market which will then lead to a rally on bitcoin however it's not all Sunshine rainbows after that happens because we're still having to deal with CPI you see the Consumer Price Index is a metric that tracks inflation in the United States economy and everything thing from shelter to gasoline to natural gas or electricity to eggs and then CPI is broken up into two categories number one all items and number two all items minus food and energy while all items has been coming down nicely to 4.9 percent all items less food and energy currently sits at 5.5 percent and its drop is completely stagnative over the course of the last five months CPI dropping is a very good thing but the problem is all items and core inflation that being all items minus food and energy have both started to stagnate right around five percent and this season of inflation coming down very aggressively is likely to be over starting this month when the next data comes out on June 13th in fact many economists are predicting that inflation is going to get a lot stickier under the five percent Mark for all items and for core inflation and that's very important because that impacts Jerome Powell's fed's decision on effective federal funds right hikes you see the effect of federal funds rate is described by the New York fed like this the effective federal funds rate is calculated as a volume weighted median of overnight federal funds transactions in English the effective federal funds rate is more or less the base rate that all other interest rates in the United States economy are based off of that includes car loans Home Loans personal loans commercial loans and pretty much any other kind of loan including credit card loans whenever the infected federal funds rate increases then that causes every single other interest rate to increase which increase the cost of taking on debt which reduces the amount of liquidity in the United States market and makes it harder to expand because we live in a credit and debt based society the FED has been hiking rates at their fastest rate in over 40 years in a Hail Mary attempt to try and get inflation under control the problem is that inflation is not going down anymore because of the hiking interest rates it's staying sticky at five percent because of various geopolitical realities that the FED has no power over whereas many of us were hoping for a Fed rate pause come June 14th when the meeting happens now many people including myself are predicting that we're going to see another 25 basis point rate hike from 5.15 percent all the way up to 5.4 another rate hike when we were hoping for a pause would almost certainly lead to a major drop in Bitcoin especially considering the right decision will come out the day after CPI comes out which is likely to be lackluster in conclusion Bitcoin has been looking forward to a very bullish June as a result of a recent Lux algo Buy Signal and a bullish cross on on macd followed by a bullish cross above the 50 level on RSI however as a result of the uncertainty around the debt ceiling we've seen timidity coming from the United States stock market as it attempts to break above critical resistance at 420 that timidity is spilled over into Bitcoin and means that it's having a hard time going into a rally as well that timidity on U.S stocks is going to continue until we reach a decision on the debt ceiling hike because many people are predicting if a decision does not get made and the United States defaults on its debt the stock market could drop by over 45 percent 20 trillion dollars and while there is most likely going to be a decision reached which will lead to that timidity Vanishing in the United States stock market just a week after that decision is probably going to be raged on June 5th or 6th then we're probably going to see bearish data coming from CPI in the very next day on June 14th we're going to see a Fed rate hike when we were hoping for a pause all of that to mean that the first two weeks of June are shaping up to actually be very difficult for Bitcoin and if we see any bullishness from Bitcoin we should take that as a great sign of the health of the market because it's got so many things standing in its way right now but the thing I want you guys to remember is that these dark clouds are temporary I just decision on the debt ceiling will be made in the next week and the decision that seems to be taking place will kick the can down the road for another two years and we won't have to worry about until January of 2025.""]"
34,33,29,33_oil_prices_supply_demand,"['oil', 'prices', 'supply', 'demand', 'commodity', 'companies', 'capital', 'global', 'reserve', 'energy']","[""so you're asking oil companies to further lower what makes you think that they are going to listen to an Administration that is ultimately trying to put them out of business how how is the administration trying to put them out of business well they produce fossil fuels and this President says he wants to end fossil fuel so look there's a couple of other things at play in terms of the investors and these oil companies firstly we've come out of a couple of really interesting phases of the oil cycle in 2007 and eight the last time that oil companies really rocketed up and oil prices were very high there was a lot of incentive for oil companies to grow and to deploy capital and finding more oil and that really caused quite a significant oversupply in the oil Market it meant that oil prices went down and really there were a lot of investors burned from encouraging companies to go through that exercise so there's been a real shift and if you listen to the likes of the Occidental quarterly conference calls you'll no longer hear them talking a lot about finding new oil and spending a lot of money on Capital expenditures to drill more Wells and so on uh you'll instead hear them talking a lot about debt repayment about sheer BuyBacks and about paying dividends to shareholders and finally there's some research that I covered in a previous video here on the channel that suggests that over the very long term if oil were to get below the say 40 to 60 dollar per barrel range it would really no longer be economic for most oil companies to exist so anything can happen in the short term with all sorts of commodity prices but that probably is some sort of very long-term floor for oil so to sum up where I think Buffett's head is probably out if I really had to guess I think there's probably two core factors really at play when he's investing in the likes of Occidental and Chevron I think firstly he probably has a view that oil prices stay higher for longer than most people anticipate and secondly I think he really likes the capital allocation taking place at these companies limited capital expenditure for growth and exploration and a lot of cash being funneled back towards shareholders through debt repayments dividends and share BuyBacks and to an extent I think that second capital allocation points probably reinforces the first point of oil prices Staying High if every company is just doing a bunch of sheer BuyBacks and paying dividends and no one's spending money on looking for new oil that is another kind of big constraint over the long term on oil supply now I recently actually got the chance to sit down and interview Jake Taylor who some of you may know from the value after hours podcast he's also the CEO of Farnam Street Investments and the author of The Rebel allocator the full podcast episode with Jake will be going live probably later this week on the investing with Tom podcast YouTube channel on and on all audio platforms as well and I just want to play a clip of something that Jake said in that podcast episode really exactly on some of the points I've been discussing in this video like I'm very hopeful that Humanity will make the transition from hydrocarbons to more renewable sources of energy and I think we will get there eventually I just think it's going to take a long time and as an investor if everyone thinks it's going to take a short time and you think it's going to take longer that that has often been a pretty good bet to make is that things take longer than than everyone thinks now we all know that Warren Buffett is a value investor anytime he's looking to buy into a particular company and oil is no exception he's looking to buy that business below its intrinsic value and he actually mentioned specifically in the 2007 annual shareholder meeting for Birch Hathaway uh how he thinks about investing in oil companies he said if we are in an oil stock it's because we think it offers a lot of value at this price but it does not mean we think the price of oil is going up if we thought oil was going up we could buy oil Futures which we actually did once so how exactly does Warren Buffett calculate something like intrinsic value for an oil company because these businesses are very different from a apple or Microsoft or Costco which a very steady businesses that produce stable and growing amounts of cash flow and earnings oil companies are quite different they can be very very volatile and the earnings year to year are heavily influenced by the price of oil again I want to play another clip here from my interview with Jake Taylor where he presents a pretty nice idea of thinking about valuation with some of these very cyclical businesses I think I ideally in a in like that type of commodity company you would you probably like Buy on Price to Book and sell on PE so wait until you buy when the business isn't working assuming that you know that it's it's a cyclical Decline and not a secular Decline and that that is not always obvious uh so as you know a lot of people could attest to buying companies that they thought were just at a temporary dip"", ""well I'm not going to sit here and act like I can predict that and the short term nobody knows and in the short term there is really no floor or ceiling for what commodity prices can do and oil is absolutely no exception but in the long term there are a few things that I think are worth sharing now there's some really good research I kind of stumbled across from a guy called Gary Turner who is the CEO of Trove research and he published a really interesting study on basically Returns on equity and Returns on invested capital and Renewables and and oil companies and how that changes at different oil prices now the US is the largest producer of oil in the world and the Returns on equity and Returns on invested Capital that the companies and then you know of course the returns that investors can generate are going to be heavily dependent on the price of oil as Warren Buffett has just told us and uh This research from uh Gary Turner suggests that if oil were to stabilize in the 40 to 60 dollar Barrel range then the typical large U.S oil company would only earn about a four percent return on Capital and within that 40 to 60 dollar range those Returns on investor Capital actually changed quite dramatically uh at sixty dollar oil the average large U.S oil and gas company would earn about an eight percent return on invested capital and at forty dollar oil they would earn about a 1.3 return on invested Capital so all of that is to say that if oil were to get below say forty to sixty dollars a barrel in the very long term the US basically doesn't have a sustainable oil industry the returns will be too anemic to Warrant you know new Investments so that sort of puts potentially a longer term flaw on oil prices and you would think that over time the cost of production for oil will tend to go up we have that just through General inflation and asset prices and labor prices going up but we also have that through sort of the physical reality ways of finding oil you know all the easy oil has largely been sucked out of the ground already and oil companies are having to get sort of increasingly heroic and go further distances and so on to find new oil now in terms of a potential sealing price or upper limit for where Oil could go to there's a pretty famous saying in commodity businesses that the cure to high prices is high prices and that basically means that as commodity prices go up and companies start earning very high sort of super normal Returns on Capital that tends to encourage more people to produce that particular commodity and earn those super high Returns on Capital and that of course pushes prices back down again if it gets too extreme you have sort of the marginal producers of a particular commodity kind of pull back and restrain production and that's how you have these Epson flows and commodity prices over time but there are a few things that are potentially different this time and I know that is the most dangerous phrase and invest in but you have this very kind of political situation where producing more oil is very very frowned upon and you also have an investor base that is really demanding a capital return through dividends or BuyBacks having been burnt in a recent cycle add to that the fact again that oil will without doubt get harder to find over time I really don't know what the cln 2 oil prices could be now to sum up Buffett's investment case at an Occidental and Chevron I actually think it's very simple there's a lot of moving Parts here but I think there are really two core drivers behind this investment from Buffett firstly I think he probably has a view that long-term oil prices will be higher and they'll be higher for longer than most investors probably anticipate in many ways there is the structural mismatch between oil supply and oil demand and if those two things that I just said turn out to be correct they can really only mean one thing for oil prices which is that they have to go up the second thing that I think Buffett likes is that there is very little capital expenditure for growth he's getting a lot of his cash back very quickly through dividends and BuyBacks particularly when oil prices are as high as they have been recently oils come back a little bit in the past month but you know if we look at just the sheer amount of cash flow that companies like Occidental have been producing it's been pretty insane I mean oxy produced 4.2 billion dollars of free cash flow in their second quarter this year which is a six percent free cash flow yield just from that one quarters cash flow they also retired 4.8 billion in debt and purchase back 1.1 billion of stock"", ""and I don't want to get into the Weeds on that too much other than to say there's not a whole lot of political motivation to go out and encourage oil companies to continue to to explore for new oil and find more oil and produce more oil it's very much the opposite direction and that kind of has a lot of downward pressure on Supply and potentially you know the flying effect of that is you know pushing oil prices up at least in the short term the other part that comes into it pretty significantly is simply investors having been burned through previous commodity Cycles if we look back at something as simple as the Occidental Petroleum stock chart from the early 2000s we'll see that oxy was ripping upwards and something similar was happening on a lot of oil companies not only in the US but in many parts of the world through that time and the core thing that oil investors were really looking for at the time was growth you know it was all about growth and exploration and finding more oil and after oil peaked in 2007 a lot of investors were really burned and if you listen to basically any investor call from an oil company these days there's very few of them talking about new oil exploration and looking to grow capacity almost all of them are instead focused on things like sheer repurchases and dividends so you have this really interesting Dynamic where Oil demand does continue to steadily track upwards over time and there's politics and capital allocation and potentially pushing the supply of oil down or at the very least slowing it from growing as fast as it might have done historically now Buffett has shared thoughts on oil investing a few times over the years something you said in 2020 was when you buy into a huge oil production company how it works out is going to depend on the price of oil to a great extent it's not going to be your geological home runs or super mistakes or anything like that it's an investment that depends on the price of oil""]"
35,34,27,34_ratio_earnings_company_business,"['ratio', 'earnings', 'company', 'business', 'book', 'price', 'businesses', 'growth', 'current', 'share']","[""so yes for Apple twenty seven point one one that is a little bit high I think generally anything above twenty is considered sort of high but you also need to take into account the industry as well as the potential growth for this company in the future another number that is important is the PEG ratio and this is the price to earnings to growth ratio to calculate the PEG ratio you take the p/e ratio from what we got before and you divide by the earnings per share growth over X years I know this is a little bit complicated so let's go through an example let's say that a company has a share price of $50 and the earnings per share is $1 this leaves them with a p/e ratio of 50"", ""so long story short the higher the p ratio is the more that people are paying for the current earnings of the business and the pe ratio is very widely used if you look up pretty much any stock uh almost on any sort of platform whether that be just a simple google search of a particular stock or whether you look a business up on something like yahoo finance or msn money or whichever other service you might be using uh you can pretty much always get a p e ratio for that business as one of the first stats that's presented to you now there are a couple of situations where you actually won't see a pe ratio certainly the most common is if the business doesn't have any earnings or if they are losing money so if you see a business with no pay ratio listed that probably means that the business isn't earning money if you have negative earnings it's very hard to calculate a p e ratio the other thing you might see is maybe a negative pe basically means the same thing the business is not earning money now again something like a p e ratio does not completely replace an overall intrinsic value calculation something that has a high p ratio may be expensive compared to today's earnings but that business may be set up to grow very fast out into the future and it can very quickly grow into that p e ratio but if you have a stock that is trading at a very low p e ratio it may not exactly be cheap either because that business may have declining earnings over time which if the price stays steady and the earnings are going down that means the pe ratio will actually go up over time which is sort of the reverse of what might happen with a growing companies so in terms of how i use this personally there are basically two main things that are really i'm screening out so i'm not typically using a pe ratio to say yes i'm going to invest in this company it's usually the reverse it's usually a quick way of eliminating businesses and saying that i'm really not interested at them um at this price it's really not worth me doing any more digging into this company because it's unlikely that i'm going to be able to get my heat around the valuation or it's unlikely that i'm going to be able to get behind with any degree of confidence some of the growth expectations that might be built into a particular company so the first number that might come up in a p e ratio that will have me pretty much completely ignoring that business and moving on to something else is if it has no p e ratio or if the p e ratio is negative either that company is not earning money or it's losing money and then reporting a negative p ratio that is pretty much always an instant pass for me i'm generally looking at profitable profitable businesses and businesses that are reasonably predictable over time as well"", ""we're going to talk about is the price to book ratio and the price to book ratio is again a fairly easy to get kind of metric for most companies if you look up a business on something like yahoo finance search the stock ticker and look up some key statistics you'll pretty much always see a price to book ratio and this is one of those metrics that is really really useful for some businesses and not so useful for other businesses so let's first describe what the price to book ratio is again just like the p e ratio we have a price factor and we're dividing that by some other number in this case book value now book value is simply the assets of the company minus any of the liabilities so if the business owns a bunch of buildings and a bunch of intellectual property for example those are all assets if they have some long-term debt then that would be a liability so you take the assets you take away the debt and the kind of net amount that equity that you are left with is what's called book value in accounting terms so when you look at a price to book ratio if you see a price to book ratio of less than one you're basically seeing a business that is trading for less than that book value uh you can buy it for half of sort of the net worth of that company for example if the book value was 0.5 or if the book value was something like 3 for example you're paying many multiples of sort of the net worth that is built into the balance sheet of that company now like i said earlier there are some businesses where the price to book ratio is really useful and other businesses where the price to book ratio is really a complete waste of time and it basically comes down to looking at how that particular company earns money now if the business is in some sort of industry where the amount of assets that that company has basically directly controls the amount of income and earnings that that business generates that's a situation where the price to book ratio can be quite useful so a classic example here is something like a real estate business now a real estate businesses income is basically entirely driven by how much real estate the company has there's really no way that a real estate company can go ahead and earn a really dramatically higher amount of income without increasing the asset value in its portfolio increasing the book value in that company so things like real estate companies things like farms things like banks or insurance companies those are all industries where the assets of the company hugely dictate the amount of money that those businesses can earn and for that reason the price to book ratio is a metric that's really useful when you're analyzing those companies at least on a surface level before you do a deep dive into some of those companies so if you come across a real estate company for example or a bank or insurance company and you see that the price to book ratio is well below one it's trading at far less than the book value or the uh equity value of that company then that is something that may be of more interest to you and something that is potentially undervalued but there are a wide range of businesses where the amount of assets that they have does not necessarily dictate how profitable those companies are going to be and these are companies that can quite rationally be priced at many multiples of their book value so a company like apple for example comes to mind apple can increase their profitability by selling new services or increasing the price of their iphones or selling more iphone units are really without spending a whole bunch of money on creating new assets so apple coca-cola microsoft any business that really is brand heavy and produces a large amount of money on a relatively small asset base those are the types of businesses where the price to book ratio is really not particularly useful uh as the businesses profitability is really not dictated by the amount of assets that are sort of on that company's balance sheet in terms of how i use this metric personally basically if it's one of these businesses that produces a lot of profit on a relatively small asset base and it's really not the asset size that dictates their profitability that's the type of business where i will just completely ignore the price to book ratio but if it's a business where the assets are sort of the main driver of how profitable that company becomes over time uh then that is a situation where i will be far more interested in the price to book ratio and really what i'm looking for is if it's in and around one or especially if it's below one uh that is a situation again where it's not necessarily guaranteed to be undervalued but it's a situation where i'm able to say that this business could potentially be undervalued it's possibly trading below intrinsic value and it certainly warrants more digging from me as an investor now the third and final metric that we're going to talk about in this video is ev to ebit which is sometimes referred to as the acquirers multiple because of this book the acquires multiple where they talk about eve but and basically uh really interestingly if you had simply just bought the lowest ev ebit stocks in the stock market consistently over a long period of time you actually would have produced a 17.5 percent compounded return from 1973 through to 2017 compared to about 10.2 percent on the S&P500 and that was basically the topic of this book by tobias carlile the acquirers multiple""]"

ideas software is a new breed of electronic trade idea generation technology designed to help traders find better opportunities in real time it combines the latest developments and user interface design real-time data mining and filtering that brings an unparalleled view of what is happening in the market right now let's take a look a trade ideas alert window consists of several columns these columns provide detail information regarding a particular situation in the market that is taking place right now traders use a configuration menu to select specific events that they want to see let's take a look at some of those options trade ideas has alerts for different styles of trading activity and for different types of traders options range in complexity from simple events such as highs and lows to complex situations and pattern recognition to alerts aimed more at the institutional trader such as the V WAP and blocked trade analysis alerts the second tab titled window specific filters allows a user to filter the universe of stocks that is currently being tracked since trade ideas looks at all stocks in real time all the time if a user does not apply any filters it is easy to get inundated with information trade ideas does not require the user to know anything about programming or technical analysis it has a library of pre-configured strategies that can be used right out-of-the-box let's take a look at the high-low ticker high-low tickers are available in some applications but none give you the multi timeframe option which allows you to see the long term and the midterm trends for stocks making highs and lows additionally this is a good example of how fast information can come through trade ideas if not filtered there's no need to worry about system overloads or tying up resources because the processing takes place server-side at trade ideas data centers now that we can see how fast data can come through let's unleash the full power of the system through its filters as I mentioned earlier filters located on the second tab from the left are a way to limit the amount of stocks that trade ideas monitors just like the alerts filters range from the very basic such as minimum price maximum price and average volume you know right now these filters are blank because by default we are monitoring every new high and low let's put some values in there to make things a bit more specific now the system is only looking at stocks between 10 and 100 dollars and that have a maximum spread of 10 cents at the time of the new high and low and trades an average of 1 million shares per day now let's press ok and notice how the flow of data slows down to meet the filtered criteria as we look further we notice that filters allow you to paint almost any type of graphical picture in your mind to look for very specific positive or negative situations the more you learn about filters the more power you will get out of this software additionally you can filter for stocks traded on certain exchanges and you can create symbol lists to monitor only a specific group of stocks that you want to monitor finally after setting your alerts and filters you can name the window something that makes sense in terms of what alerts and filters were created for example we will name this window trade ideas video tour for brokers press okay to start the new window you can create multiple windows to watch different strategies and place them side-by-side now we are going to set up to alert windows above a level 2 window with order entry and a chart this allows traders to quickly see the situation up close and place the trade if desired trade ideas allows traders to free themselves from being slaves to the bull market and are able to see opportunities in any situation"", ""and you know we could say you know a minimum value of let's say 0.95 oops 0.95 and a maximum value of let's say 0.02 and show that this will tell me where um [Music] you know stocks are essentially between those values like that okay and we'll go ahead and click ok all right and now we have the basis of an alert window here all right i think the last one that i want to look at for you because i think it's always great for people to understand what this filter does is relative volume all right and here's a relative volume alert not to be confused with the filter that we're going to work with they're very similar but not exactly the same we click add that filter what the relative volume filter does is it looks back 10 days and gives us a ratio average of the volume over those 10 days okay"", ""and we decide you know are we going with an alert alert window or a top list window um we'll do for this exercise we'll start with an alert window and everybody's alert window is going to default to be something i forget exactly what it says i think it's going to be like breaking out on volume will be the windows name for everybody when they start and you can change what your default blank alert window starts with your new default alert window start with this just happens to be what i did mine as i tried to keep it very simple what's in what's in here for me starting off and just a few filters that i'm you know big into using alert windows have two components to them so let's start with that first alerts are going to be events so these here new high new low new ask high new new low bid you know items like these the single icon those are going to be your events or also were better known as alerts then you also have your filters your filters will look like this there'll be a dual set of icons here this teal color will indicate a minimum value that you'll add for that filter and this purple color will indicate a maximum value that you can add for that filter

that will take time to customize and make before sending it to the purchaser now definitely prefer instant downloads because you have the ability to make fully passive income that has zero product cost but of course if you want to charge more per order you can definitely go down the custom print rep there's so many people out there selling their digital arts and"", ""and you can even target people that photos on their phone right like it doesn't have to be professional photographers lots of people sell presets geared towards hobbyists and instagramers who want to edit their photos on their phone now to sell your presets you can use a marketplace like filter grade that will help streamline the process of marketing and selling the product these services usually take a percentage of your sales so if you're looking to actually keep all of your profit you should instead sell them on your own website or e-commerce shop overall a super cool way to make money with an evergreen digital product so that brings us to the next digital product which is selling social media templates this includes things like instagram story templates content creating media kits or really any template that will help anyone on social media for example you could sell templates for real estate agents that need better advertising for their properties on social media the reason why people buy these social media templates is for two reasons one they don't want to take the time to learn how to use photoshop which is what most people assume is needed even with free and easy to use platforms like canva people don't have the time to spend creating and designing their own posts which is where you come in especially with the growing number of professionals joining social media platforms the demand for these types of templates will continue to go up and up and as you guys know i love selling things that are trending upwards in demand like all other digital products you need to invest time to create the templates upfront"", ""but after that they can sell over and over with zero product costs to you and you're really saving people a ton of time by supplying them with these types of templates which means you can charge a good amount for them the process is very simple if you use a platform like canva to create all of your templates because you have tons of click and drag elements so you don't need to be a design expert at all there's also programs like photoshop and illustrator that take a long time to master but if you want the easiest program to use i just recommend going with canva focus on making targeted templates for specific people so for example you can make instagram story templates for specific niches like real estate agents loan originators and other entrepreneurs these types of people are the ones joining social media professionally for the first time and they're absolutely going to be looking for these types of templates it makes sense because if they buy a template all they have to do is plug in their own text and pictures to have a social media post in under a minute next up is fonts and i think that this is one that you guys use a lot but don't realize you can actually sell your own font as a product preferences and fonts are constantly changing so if you're someone that can create fonts you're in luck more than 600 000 companies are being made every year and with everyone moving to an online business model there will be a huge demand for new fonts if you guys are into graphic design then this could be a really great way for you to experiment with your artistic creativity while also making a good amount of passive income per month the average price for a font is about 30 let's say you do a hundred sales per month that's going to equate to three thousand dollars which is amazing if you don't care about keeping 100 of sales but want more exposure you can also sell it through an online font reseller like creative market where you keep between 10 to 70 i know selling fonts sounds a little bit out there but you can really make a living off of it depending on how much effort you put in for example jeremy vesey makes six figures per year selling fonts on creative market it's definitely a strenuous process to create a font and it's definitely a skill you need to perfect but like every other product on this list it's a crate once get continuous sales 24 7 type of deal and your buyers can come from anywhere in the world making the market absolutely massive for our next digital product we have spreadsheets these include documents calculator spreadsheets and any template that helps do conversions or calculations billions of people use spreadsheets every day and because of this you can actually make a ton of money selling them some popular templates that have been created are ones to help people with bookkeeping dieting expenses data sets and more the problem is that many of the applications out there like microsoft excel or google sheets can get very advanced which is why you see tons of influencers on tick tock and youtube starting accounts dedicated to teaching others how to use it if you're curious about whether there really is an interest in this market take a look at miss excel or your excel friend on tiktok their videos generate tens and even sometimes hundreds of thousands of views for their excel tutorials which i'll admit are extremely helpful i can also see these types of tutorials being helpful if you're a college student taking an excel class as well as anyone that's just you know looking to make your life easier if you guys are already in a certain niche i guarantee you that you can create spreadsheets to help people if you're in real estate you can create spreadsheets that calculate returns on investments for properties if you're into credit card points you can sell spreadsheets that help calculate point values or compare redemptions between different airline points""]"

sending out rebates that could help cover the additional sales tax for lower income individuals although in terms of my thoughts this would certainly reward people with a high income who don't like to spend a lot of money but would end up costing everyone else a lot more not to mention a 2004 study found that if the United States were to replace its current tax system with a sales tax the rate would have to be as high as 60 percent to bring in the same amount of money as we are currently any lower and we'd likely plunge even deeper into a worse national debt which was the entire reason the

less save more and long term you're not going to be burdened to high monthly payments if something were to happen and before not having a good understanding of taxes here in the United States the average single worker pays 30.5 percent of their income to taxes meaning one-third of your entire working year is spent just to earn enough to pay the IRS that means it's more important now than ever to at least have a basic understanding of how the tax system works so that you could utilize every resource at your disposal to keep and save more money most of these unfortunately are never taught in school no one ever tells you to do anything about it and generally people just accept that taxes are as inevitable as death which is true but there are ways to at least make it a little less painful for example if you're working a typical nine to five job see if your employer offers a 401k which can reduce your taxable income by the amount that you invest we're looking to tax less harvesting you're losing Investments the end of of the year so that you could offset up to three thousand dollars from your paycheck or if you're on a business it might make sense to run that through an LLC or an S corporation so that you could reduce your self-employment tax there's so many different strategies out there that you could legally utilize to keep more money in your pocket and a lot of that comes down to your understanding of the tax system or hiring a professional who does number five ignoring retirement accounts I guess since we're on the topic of taxes it makes sense that we talk about this one here because there can be some serious money to be made just like the law allows you to legally reduce your tax bill it also offers you Financial incentives if you invest and three of them are fairly easy for almost anybody to do the first is a Roth IRA that allows you to contribute up to sixty five hundred dollars a year and all the profit you make within that account is completely tax-free at the age of 59 and a half second you can also look into investing within a traditional 401K which allows you to contribute up to twenty two thousand five hundred dollars a year like I mentioned earlier"", ""well that's true until you account for taxes it was reported that in the United States the average single worker paid 30.5 percent of their income to taxes in 2022

But at the end of the day, the number one thing, the most important piece of this is you're doing what you are passionate about and if you don't wanna be an electrician, obviously don't do that but I always recommend if you're going to go to college, at least have some kind of plan as to what you're gonna do after college and how much money you can make with that degree."", ""but you're going to make more money and be able to pay off those loans but that doesn't mean that everyone should go to college but it's important to keep going with education whether that is trade school maybe that is Community College maybe that's in actual college or maybe it's just your free local library but the point is that it's important to continue to learn more and that's a big mistake that people make it's maybe they graduate high school they get a job and they don't go past that they don't learn they don't push themselves maybe they enter a trade maybe they become a plumber or a welder or an electrician and they don't go past that they get their certification and they don't go past that that goes for college education as well people might get a bachelor's degree maybe a master's but then they don't go past that they get their job"", ""It just does not make financial sense and there are so many people out there that are making maybe $30, $40,000 per year driving brand new Ford F150s or cars that they just can't afford and then they wonder why they have no money at the end of the month. Okay the third huge financial mistake that people are making in their 20's is getting into debt with student loans. Now I'm not saying that college is necessarily a bad thing. I went to college. I got a two year degree in Electrical Construction and now here I am making YouTube videos so obviously I'm not using my college education but it cost me altogether $12,000 over the course of two years and I was fortunate enough to have some money from my grandfather that paid for college so I was blessed to not have to go into debt but even so, I went community college to keep that expense as low as possible.

earlier than the scrap shows but this is the data that we've got available and you'll see that charlie has steadily accumulated shares and costco over time and if you're wondering what happened here in late 2010 early 2011 that was actually to do with the transfer of shares related to the passing of charlie munger's wife uh costco had some commentary around that in 2010 when they filed a form 4 with the sec and even after that charlie has continued to accumulate shares so i don't think charlie's actually ever sold costco for reasons of overvaluation or the business not performing as he expected or anything like that he seems to have just steadily accumulated more and more costco over the years and as of the latest data we have in 2022 charlie is the proud owner at least directly of 186 615 costco shares which is valued at almost exactly 100 million dollars now we also know that charlie owns a little bit more costco through at least one foundation but that 186 000 shares is the core holding and 100 million dollars is not that significant actually in charlie munger's overall portfolio uh for a bit of context his berkshire hathaway position is currently about 2.25 billion dollars but nonetheless charlie loves to talk about costco and the money he did put into costco probably somewhere in the late 90s and steadily a bit more particularly in the early 2000s it's been a very successful investment for charlie and there's a lot that we can learn from him continuing to purchase into the business now many people of course will know the business of costco it is a membership only store where you can buy basically anything uh you can buy it in huge quantities and you can buy it very cheaply and uh charlie munger loves that costco is basically one of these win-win-win business models it's an example of what nick sleep might call scale economy shared and nick sleep as a uk investor who also for a long time had a position in costco and the way that costco basically works from a business model perspective a lot of people will say that costco basically makes very little money from the core uh retail operations uh and they make most of their money from costco memberships and there is actually a quite a bit of truth to that so costco only marks our products to a maximum of about 14 sometimes they will mark up products a little less than that and they are very strict on that kind of 14 limit"", ""costco wholesale is one of the best performing stocks of the past 40 years an early investor who held these years from ipo through to today would have made about 300 times their money and on top of that they would have received their initial investment back many many times over through regular dividends and from time to time very large special dividends costco is also a business that charlie munger absolutely loves he's been on the board of costco since 1997 and when he's ever given half an opportunity to mention costco he absolutely loves

check out the past couple videos here on the channel if you want to see some slightly different style charlie munger investments in those first couple of videos we talked about cigar butts we talked about very deep value extremely cheap oil stocks and we talked about charlie munger betting very large on special situations and merger arbitrage and that sort of thing now costco is getting much more

identify certain business momentums in the real world that aren't necessarily the financials and allow for sustained High Returns on Capital now coincidentally around 2004 when Norbert Lou was in the very early days of his fund he actually traveled as part of a holiday to South America and to Argentina and he noticed a very dominant kind of beer brand in uh kilmirs I believe I'm pronouncing that correctly he basically said I remember seeing it everywhere sometimes alternatives to that brand were not even available he'd previously spent quite a bit of time basically just learning about beer businesses and reading annual reports of giant very highly valued beer companies like Anheuser-Busch and like Heineken but he'd never made an investment in any of those companies basically just because they they look too expensive but in the summer of 2004 he actually came across a press release from a company called quincer which owns the uh Kilmer's beer brand essentially and the first release explained that they were looking to pursue something called a Dutch Tinder offer for a large portion of their shares which is essentially just when a company tries to do a very large purchase oftentimes buying out quite substantial shareholders for essentially the lowest price they they can and this is what really prompted Norbert Lou to look much closer at the underlying company now there were a few things that kind of initially jumped out to Norbert Lou firstly there really were a lot of people that were turned off to the idea of investing in a place like Argentina they were very high interest rates there was a lot of inflation and the stock market had kind of just been depressed for a long period of time but for that reason when he looked at the kind of quincer company he saw that it traded at about six times operating earnings which made it just about the cheapest beer company he had ever seen you know trading at a much much lower multiples of earnings than companies like Heineken and Anheuser-Busch and so on he mentions in the out article that a critical thing was having some belief that just because it's Argentina doesn't mean you can't have a good company and if the country blows up it doesn't mean all the companies will be a disaster so after a deeper dive into the company Norbert Lou basically discovered three different things that made it a really interesting potential investment case firstly he found that Quincy had massive market share they'd been around since 1888 they had 80 market share in Argentina and almost 100 market share in Bolivia Paraguay and Uruguay and he was kind of asking himself the question you know why is that and to a significant extent he said one of the things that's so special about beer is this natural tendency for the industry to consolidate and for all the advantages to accrue to the largest player he noted that lots of consumers tended to identify with a particular beer brand you know in the U.S someone might identify as a Budweiser Drinker for example as as something that he mentioned and he mentioned that as the brands kind of start to build and scale up the sort of the self-reinforcing process where uh the beer brands that have the most sales tend to have larger advertising budgets that tends to lead to more sales it tends to lower their cost of production because they can scale into much larger production facilities and it just makes it really hard for other beer brands to compete essentially even very well capitalized International competitors can come into a market with their you know fancy new beer brand and they're going to find it really challenging to displace the beer brand that already has significant market share and that consumers are really identifying with personally all of that resulted in a couple of different things it meant that Quinta had about 60 Returns on invested capital and you know that survived a very long time they were founded in 1888 that survived Wars military coups and hyperinflation and the third thing that Norbert Lou really liked about the business is he felt that it had a degree of untapped pricing power he explains that for most companies in order to increase your Revenue you tend to have to kind of increase your expenses as well whether it's marketing or producing more units of whatever you're selling but he said with a small minority of companies you do have true pricing power you can put up the price of your products without necessarily having a material impact on the volume of that product that you're able to sell and if you can increase your prices and keep your expenses relatively flat that can do great things for operating margins and operating profits he noted two things with this particular company in relation to pricing power firstly people identify very strongly with the brand of beer that they drink and they're more than happy to pay a modest premium to other you know competitive Brands if they can drink the brand that they identify with and that they're used to and he also said that the bimberg family who had controlled the company for several decades had actually for a long time been raising the price at a far slower rate than simply the rate of inflation and for that reason he believed it was quite a bit of sort of latent pricing power built in here now the final sort of complicating factor that was happening at more of a kind of corporate level as opposed to the qualitative aspects of the business was that there was this quite complex uh put call agreement between the bimberg family who controlled most of the shares in this company and ambiv and it essentially meant two things one uh the benberg family had the right to sell this steak and the ambiv company had the right to buy those same shares at certain times in the future and after doing some kind of deep digging into various SEC filings and so on uh Norbert Lou was basically able to find that the price at which those transactions could potentially happen was very heavily influenced by the ebitdar of the business so you had kind of of a lot of things really aligning here for Norbert Lou you had basically the world's cheapest beer company you had a very dominant Market position you've got the lowest cost beer producer in the region because of their immense scale you've got untapped pricing power you've got a family looking to sell for the first time in Generations you've got that family incentivized to maximize earnings more than ever the simplest way to do that of course is to tap into some of that latent pricing power and all of these factors working in harmony created a very very compelling investment case for Norbert Lou now in terms of the timeline here Norbert Lou was doing most of this research in mid 2004 and the sort of price increase in game had actually already started back in 2003 so in 2003 um prices were bumped 10 percent in March another 10 in September and then another 10 throughout 2004 and throughout that period of time uh Norbert Lou's sort of pricing our latent pricing power theory was actually proven correct you know as the prices were being bumped up by by the company for this brand of beer the overall volume was actually still going up as well so there wasn't any notable impact at all on sales volume even with pretty significant price increases now interestingly there was actually an ADR listed in the US for quincer I guess a little bit like some of the Chinese technology companies today like Alibaba jd.com and so on they have American depository receipts listed on American stock exchanges so Norbert Lou was able to access ownership in the company kind of through that vehicle and he put on a 15 position in the punch card Capital portfolio in August of 2004 paying 17 per ADR in 2004 the company's ebitdar grew 48 in 2005 it grew another 40 percent uh prices kept increasing volumes kept growing and the operating kind of margins here for this business kept expanding very rapidly following that quite a few things happened firstly our Norbert Lou increased his position to about 20 and the fund""]"
