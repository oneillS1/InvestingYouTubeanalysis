Uw_QyeHo8f0, i had started investing when i was 11. i just dithered away until when i was seven or eight nine but so unfortunately i didn't get started till i was 11. but i bought my first stock when i was 11 and then i experimented with a whole bunch of things like timing of stocks and charting and doing all these crazy things it was a lot of fun profitless but a lot of fun and i did that until i was 19. and i read all the books on investing in the public library and just i ate it up it was fascinating to me but i had no framework i was just searching for something i was hoping that little things on a chart would tell me something about what a stock was going to do it was kind of crazy,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,but everybody else was doing it so i figured i'd do it too sometimes you turn the chart upside down you know it still wouldn't help then in 1949 i read the intelligent investor by ben graham i'd never heard of them up until then and there are really only two chapters in that book that are the key to it but they set my philosophical framework for investing in three ways they're so basic and so simple it's hard to understand how they could be that important but the ten commandments are simple you know the first is that a stock is part of a business i mean you you can't think of a sock as something different it's you value a business and then you divide by the shares outstanding but what you have to think about is what kind of a business are you getting into what are its economic characteristics for its competitors what's its management like all of these things that relate to a business instead of a little ticker symbol,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,i used to know when i was 11 or 12 the ticker symbols of every company virtually on the new york stock exchange i could mark the boards of harris up them you know but i didn't know anything i mean i could you know i knew that x was u.s steel and t was at t and so on but i didn't i didn't know anything i didn't know what was behind them,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,so i had to start looking at at these little symbols or these little names in the paper as businesses and decide how do you value a business what counts the second thing in that in the book is that graham gives you a marvelous set point in terms of how the investor should react to stock market fluctuations he talks about his mythical mr market in chapter eight there's been no better thing written in terms of the investors attitude toward stock prices most people react the wrong way to stock prices i mean they feel good when their stocks go up they feel bad when they go down they think the stock market is there to instruct them and mr market is this partner you have in investing you know he's a remarkably obliging partner this guy comes around every day and he tells you what he'll pay you for your interest in the business or what he'll sell you more at the same price nobody ever does that in in private business if you owned you and i owned a gas station together,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,and i said every day i want you to come in and offer me your half interest in the station and i can either buy your half or sell you my my half at the same price and you have to come in every day and do it you'd be at a terrible disadvantage and you'd be at a particular disadvantage if you're mr market in the market because mr market or a friend of the market who obligingly gives you those figures every day different figures at the end of the day in the start of the day but he's naming a price at which you'll either buy herself the beautiful thing about him is that this guy is an alcoholic manic depressive i mean i mean he is as unsound as they come he wanders around all day you know and looks at the crazy things,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,and he you know he he's going to name all kinds of crazy prices and you don't have to pay any attention to them except when it's to your advantage to do so if that's once a year if it's once every five years it's one stock out of three thousand all you have to do is sit there there you have no moral responsibility to this jerk you know,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,i mean he is naming these numbers you didn't ask him to but he's doing it and all you have to do is pick the one time when he is particularly depressed or particularly manic or particularly drunk or whatever it may be and the market will be all of those things and and you take advantage of it and that's what's remarkable about stocks if you think about it is that if you look at the high and low on all of these american companies for the last year you'll see case after case after case where the high is twice below now that's for sound american businesses running along paying people selling goods and so on if you go out look at farmland 10 miles from here there's no way in the world over here that the farmland is going to range in value from x to 2x it doesn't maybe go from x to 110 of x or vice versa if you look at an apartment house near here and figures on essentially apartment houses like that over a year it won't it won't move 10 in a given year but here are the finest of american businesses and people just name these numbers that go all over the place and you don't have to play except when you want to that's the important thing and that's the that's what graham tells you the market isn't there to instruct you to tell you anything the markets is there just basically to serve you when you want it to serve you you know one of the most important things remember in stocks very hard to do but people have all these feelings about it the stock doesn't know you own it,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,you know you're sitting there with these certificates for berkshire the company doesn't even know you own it you know and the stock doesn't it's trading now and they don't know you own it so it has no feelings about you i mean you've got all these feelings about it but it's just part of a business if berkshire is worth 75 000 times a million and a half shares you know roughly 110 billion or something like that it's a good investment if it isn't it's a lousy investment you know you have to value the business and graham you know it's amazing but people don't do that in wall street you bet you you hear price targets or that kind of thing,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,but you see no one write a paper that says here is the nature of this business over the next 20 years you know what will that what should that business sell for forget about what it's selling for in fact one of the things i always like to do when i'm looking at investments is i like to look at them without knowing the price because if you see the price it automatically has some influence on you if you just sit down with the reports if i get an idea about looking up a company and i get these 10ks and so on i would rather not know the price because i'd rather value it without knowing the price when i used to handicap horses when i was a kid one of the things i would do is i'd get the racing form ahead of time and if there were nine horses in a race will say obviously the probabilities of of each one winning the race had to add up to 100 percent i mean one horse was going to win the race absent a dead heat or all of them dropping dead on the backstretch,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,so if you went through the racing form and i would look at the third race at hialeah i would try to figure out the percentage chance of each horse winning the race and that had to add to 100 then i would compare those percentages to the odds but i first of all i wouldn't look at the odds first i would look at the past performance and all that thing first stock market's the same way third thing in graham's book is the margin of safety if you come up to a bridge and it says capacity ten thousand pounds and you're driving a 9 800 pound truck you drive down further and find another bridge i mean you know they nobody knows exactly what that capacity is and it may have been signed may have been put up three years ago so you always leave a margin of safety you don't try to cut things that close you wait till something kind of shouts at you in the stock market and uh with those three principles you can build all kinds of all kinds of structures on that,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,but that's the foundation and if you've got that in mind and that's in the intelligent investor i've never found anything that remotely compares with all three of the ones i just you can't get rid of one leg of the three-legged stool and still have a good investment philosophy but i would say that the most important thing uh over a long period and working with big money uh is to understand the business let's just say for the moment that you were given a million dollars or whatever some was necessary and you could look around knoxville or look around all of tennessee if you want and buy into any three businesses you know between now and a week from now private businesses not trading or anything of the sort you've got a week to do it or you have to give the money back what will you be doing during the next week i mean you can look at all these companies some of them you're quite familiar with some of them you're less familiar with some you know by reputation some of them,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,you know the management some of them you know you know their competitive situation what will you be thinking about during that seven day period how will you actually be screening these companies out,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,i think you look for three businesses and you can't trade them after you buy them you're just gonna you're gonna own the rest of your life you're gonna be looking for businesses that have enduring competitive advantage you don't want to buy a burger king franchise just because nobody's come within 10 miles of it yet because you know wendy's and donald's and all of those will be there pretty soon it isn't necessarily who's earning the most money now you're going to look for something with enduring competitive advantage now that takes a business with some kind of a moat around it because capitalism by definition is a system where every time somebody has an economic castle somebody else is going to come after it's just the nature if you open a restaurant that's successful here in town you know somebody's going to take your menu and probably take your chef maybe cut your price maybe offer a little more parking maybe be a better better okay,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,whatever i mean capitalism consists of going after the other guy's castle if that's the case you want a castle with a big moat around it there's a lot of ways you can have a motor on something you could have it by patent protection you could have it by location in certain certain areas i mean if you have something in people's mind like coca-cola six billion people in the world practically all of them have something in their mind about coca-cola largely favorable they don't have anything in their mind about rc cola and if rc cola spent a billion dollars advertising they wouldn't have anything in their mind about rc cola,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,but they've got something in their mind about coke and generally it's favorable that's why coke wants to be where people are happy because they want to be at the theater they want to be at disney world they want to be at the world series they want always have you drinking that drink of coca-cola while at the same time experiencing happiness and if they do that they're going to sell a lot of coca-cola and it won't make any difference if somebody is a half a cent less of some serving than coke so that's an enduring competitive advantage and you want it run by honest enabled people don't want to go in with a crook and you don't want to go in with a dope now the best businesses to buy are the ones where you could have a dope in there i mean peter lynch says you know buy a business that's so good that an idiot can run it because sooner or later one will you know,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,and and there's some merit to that uh in fact i got a question the other day from this student group and they said you know what's going to happen to berkshire when you go gaga and i said well berkshire's so good that i can go gaga in fact i may even be you know those are the kind of businesses to own so you want but you want a management that's able and honest and then you want a price that's sensible and that's what you'd look for you go around tennessee got a week to do it,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,and you'd immediately screen out a whole bunch of things you just know that they weren't a fertile area you know that's an important thing to be able to do to know just get rid of all kinds of things there was a great article in the new yorker 30 years ago when bobby fischer was playing spassky in famous chess match which drew attention around the world and they examined how the mind could with billions and billions and billions of possibilities how it could group things so it immediately cast it down to where you had like four options and of course when the humans play something like deep thought you know or whatever the latest version is of the computer on that that computer is making maybe 700 000 or a million calculations a second and the human mind is competing against that but the computer is checking every possibility and the human mind somehow has this ability to cast out 99.999 percent of those things that the computer has to go through in order to focus on the three or four possibilities that really make sense and invest things a lot like that's not that tough because there aren't that many companies but you want to cast out all kinds of things if somebody told me that my life depended on picking among the dow jones stocks a group of 10 that would be the best performers or outperform the index as a whole i would spend my time thinking of the worst up companies in there i would cast out things and then i would figure i left those behind and that's an easier way to approach the problem actually than than trying to pick the 10 best if you were thinking about the state of tennessee you know there's a whole lot of things you wouldn't examine you just figure,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,they're too tough you might decide you know car dealerships were too tough it's always going to be competitive who knows whether ford or general motors are going to be selling more cars five years now or whether there's me terrorists on foreign who knows so you just say i'll give up on car dealers i'll pick your budget i'll think about something else and that approach that you use there is the same approach you really want to bring the stock market you've got 3 000 companies tonight you can look at on the new york stock exchange there's a valuation on every one of them it'll change tomorrow you don't have to play once a year if you have 20 good if you have five good ideas in your lifetime to get very rich you know,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Uw_QyeHo8f0,i i tell students sometimes they'd be better off if they had a punch card when they got out of school with only 20 punches on it because then instead of listening to somebody at a cocktail party and then glass the next morning buying some shirts they'd really think about every punch that's all the punches you get 20 punches is plenty you just have to make sure that you don't do any of them for frivolous reasons we never want to buy anything small at berkshire it just doesn't make any difference you know we want to think about things that can move the needle and that gets tougher as the capital gets greater but that's the way to focus on investments,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

uNH2H-f2D5E,okay let's go   how are you investing during these times  what do you think about the crash overall   so obviously the market's not where it was before  so we shouldn't be looking at the prices i think   we will be falling for the next few months but i  will be looking at the great companies like tesla   amazon nvidia all the companies that in five years  from now will still be rocketing to all-time highs   and slowly averaging down however not overdoing  myself averaging slowly to extent where i don't   feel overextended inside the market this is it  man this is where it all happened so he's gonna   be in about five minutes he just confirmed it with  me um he's gonna take you to that entrance right   over there they're gonna clear through security  once you're in you can go straight inside take   all the content you need thanks again bro got  it brother all right peace out gotta run see ya i'm not gonna lie at this point i thought we  were good,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
uNH2H-f2D5E,i mean we had secured an interview   with a big dog on wall street but unfortunately  i legally can't say if we went in there or not   even if we literally did get invited to  go inside which i'm not saying we did   a week after i got home i was told i am not  allowed to use any of the footage at first   i was gonna scrap this whole video i'm  just like sad i'm like super bummed like    yeah we'll figure something out but we came such  a long way i couldn't go out like that so instead   of throwing this whole interview away i had an  idea so first off how long have you been coming   to the stock machine i came here in 1985. got you  and you've seen a lot since then a lot of crashes   a lot of recessions how does this current dip in  the market relate to those do you see a similarity   or it's way different i've seen the crash of 87  the bubble of 2000 the financial crisis of 07.   ,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

hmcDbvGXA6U, you guys know by now that i'm a firm believer that the borrower is slave to the lender because your most powerful wealth building tool is your income and when you haven't committed your income in the form of payments to everybody else you can invest it and become wealthy really the average car payment in america today is 503 dollars that's just cray-cray that's nutty if you invest 500 in a decent growth stock mutual fund from age 30 to age 70 you'll have over 5 million dollars that one thing will make you worth 5 million isn't that amazing and so i've become known for getting people out of debt and it changes your life it changes your family tree it changes your retirement you retire with dignity you don't have to buy that cookbook 72 ways to prepare alpo and love it,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hmcDbvGXA6U,but you have to do it on purpose and getting out of debt in order to invest is the shortest way and what is amazing to me is that almost the entire financial industry focuses on one part of the equation and that's the investing part of the equation and they all have a bunch of theories now i've had all the letters and licenses after my name i have a degree in finance i've had all the licenses in the business it is amazing the number of people in the financial world whether they're financial advisors writers bloggers whatever they do that have opinions about money that don't have any money and whose track record on teaching people to invest in getting them to invest sucks three percent of the public is where all of those people make their money off wealthy people they make all their money off wealthy people and most of the advisors out there won't fool with you if you don't have some money they don't want to sit down and talk to you,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hmcDbvGXA6U,and so we start teaching people of course all these years ago how we invest and then as we've met with many many many thousands of millionaires over the years how did they invest what are they doing well we suggest and i personally invest in good growth stock mutual funds i spread it across four types growth and income growth aggressive growth and international and i buy mutual funds that have at least a 10-year track record well dave shouldn't you just buy index funds well you can if you want index funds basically an S&P500 fund mirrors the market that basically is the stock market and so you're going to do exactly what the stock market does good or bad the mutual funds that i buy outperform the S&P500 and they're really not that hard to find a lot of mutual funds don't outperform the S&P500 so if you're going to buy that well that'd be dumb just buy an S&P500,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
hmcDbvGXA6U,but i buy mutual funds that outperform the S&P500 and my portfolio mix that i just outlined as pretty much always beats the market because i buy funds that outperform the market it's not that hard to do you open up the prospectus and there's two little lines on the graph one of them is the S&P500 if the mutual fund you're looking at if that line is below that S&P500 line don't buy that bun this is hard really not that much to this but dave you just tell people buy those loaded funds yeah,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hmcDbvGXA6U,they'll pay a commission that's fine have somebody in your life helping you do the investing all the data says that you'll continue to invest doing that but when you out there by yourself with all your theories and some idiot newscaster comes on the evening news predicting the end of the world what do you do you cash out all your mutual funds at exactly the wrong time because you don't have anybody in your corner saying don't jump don't jump instead you're just out there with your own emotions in the newscaster and that's how you pick out when you jump in or out of the market and that's just dumb so all the data says a decent portfolio of good performing mutual funds wins and the big thing is actually putting money into the mutual funds actually investing one piece of research shows that 74 of the reason of retirement success is doing it it's called savings rate the number of you that put money in versus talk about it and continually put money in year after year year after year year after year month after month week after week out of your check into your 401k over and over and over and over and over again this is how you get wealthy it's ludicrous,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hmcDbvGXA6U,i know a lot about mutual funds and let me tell you i pick mutual funds about 80 percent of the choice on my mutual fund 85 is based on its rate of return its track record if the track record's tied and i'm trying to look i look for the longest track record who's been doing it a long time i like neighborhoods with big oak trees when i'm buying real estate you see what i'm saying i like a long track record something stable i don't like risk i like to make money risk equals not making money for me big risk anyway we said spread it across four types growth and income growth aggressive growth and international let's talk about those for a second because there's all kinds of names for mutual funds and the name of the mutual fund tells you what is in the fund,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hmcDbvGXA6U,okay a growth and income fund is also called a large cap fund sometimes also called a blue chip fund now the blue chip is the most expensive chip on the poker table so that means these are big companies in this large cap is short for large capitalization large capitalization means these are large companies and so your growth and income funds are large companies boring of the four types of mutual funds that i put money into and i recommend this is the calmest if you were to chart this volatility on this fund versus the stock market you would see it's a lot calmer than the market and so it's your friend when things are going down in other words it's your stable,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hmcDbvGXA6U,it's the big old dinosaur companies they're boring when things are going up by the way it's also boring it's not exciting when things are going up it's a downer you look at that thing going why is it not doing well when the rest of the market's going up because it goes slower than the market up and slower than the market down because it's a stable land a growth fund is right in the middle the S&P500 index fund would be considered a growth fund a growth fund is companies that are growing they're kind of medium-sized companies so you might hear it call mid cap fund these are just standard growth stock mutual funds there's a whole lot of these out there ton of funds that fall in this area the idea is pretty simple the growth fund that's kind of right there in the middle you want something in the middle,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hmcDbvGXA6U,it's pretty much going to do about what the market does in terms of volatility but you can get mutual funds that are growth stock mutual funds that outperform the S&P500 you can even get growth in income funds even though they're not as volatile that outperform the S&P500 then there's the aggressive growth fund this is the wild brother okay it's the crazy one and so you might guess it's going to be also called a small cap funds these are the small companies the startups a lot of tech companies would fall into there very crazy all the fun weird stuff is in there and that means some of it fails and goes to zero and so it's a crazier mix it's gonna be much more volatile than the stock market is so it's gonna go up faster than the market goes up but it's going to go down faster than the market goes down small cap aggressive growth stock mutual funds also known in there as a merging market you would call it that too as well,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hmcDbvGXA6U,international funds means that the stocks in it are overseas companies they're not american companies it has a kissing cousin called a global fund if you think of a globe what is it it's everything so that would have international and u.s companies in a global fund and it would be a cousin to an international by the way american companies generally outperform other international companies by and large as a group and so your international fund will be your worst performing of the four over the last several decades and a global fund will outperform an international fund because you put some spice in there you put some american companies in there usually and so they're a little bit better but at least you got some stuff overseas you're not a hundred percent betting on the american economy not that i'm anti-american i am not this is not a patriotic thing this is a diversification thing and so you know you want to have some bmw and some mercedes in there you want to have some lg and some other stuff even though some of those things are made stateside those are foreign companies and so you look for companies that are overseas based could be a french company could be whatever that are in an international fund and then you spread your investing across those four types very simple here the thing is do it that's the thing everybody talks and talks and talks and talks and talks about investing the problem is nobody does it people we talk to on the millionaire theme hour that are millionaires you know they got to be millionaires they did it and they never want to ask them how they became millionaires they never say oh man i hit the home run they never say that because it never happens oh dave i hit the home run i got this mutual fund that went straight up and i made all my money and one goodbye you know my golfing buddy gave me a stock tip i don't meet millionaires that did that i hear stories about it but a golfing buddy with a stock tip is like a golfing buddy with a fishing story the one that got away i mean it's just everybody's got an opinion and it's all a bunch of crap and so you just have to really stop and go slow and steady actually investing is the way it's the way it's the only way to go so growth and income growth aggressive growth international don't chase the returns do not invest money in things you do not understand people get ripped off when they invest money in things that someone told them is good and they trusted the person instead of knowing what the flip they were doing you know all these athletes you read about the nfl stars and they lost 10 million dollars or they made 100 million dollars and it's all gone and you know you know how they lose their money because they give it to someone else to handle and they don't even look at it,overall_free_search.csv,1.0

OUr6I4T1m5k,investments in Securities Market are subject to Market risks read all the related documents carefully before investing friends in this video for author advisor I am going to talk to the topic selling too soon when you buy very very early when you buy at a valuation which is completely in your favor the stock May double within a short span of time it could be less than a year or maybe within two years when this happens you feel you've made a lot of profit in a short spell of time and you start thinking that you will have to wait a long time to make more money but if you're so early in an idea it's actually worth waiting that long time because you will make a lot more money there have been instances where a stock doubled in a very short span of time and then went on to go up many times more later most people settle for that smaller component of profit you would find that that immediate doubling would barely be 10 or 20 percent of the total profit that the idea generates over seven eight years so imagine you're early you're the first to spot an idea you bought it early and you didn't last the journey you bailed out too soon this could happen to any of us what can change this because that's exactly what all of us need to do because you can have the best of ideas and you would be getting out too soon in them then at some stage you will start becoming so tired that you don't want to look at new ideas because you are regretting the mistakes you did of selling too soon the only way you can overcome this is by planning to stay invested even before you buy if you think from that prism you will see ideas which you can hold for longer periods of time that's the starting point if you start there then you rank companies which you can hold for a long period of time and then you buy the ones that are really cheap or attractively valued when you do this mentally you are conditioned to hold for much longer than just a double in stock price and when you are conditioned you keep telling yourself that this is what I did this is why I did this this is how I am going to invest and stay invested the entire thought process from the conception stage to the point of buying and across the period of ownership is then aligned clearly you don't get distracted by making quick profits and you don't mind waiting a little longer to make much bigger profits so the quick profit does not rob you of the bigger profit so when you make a double which may be twenty percent of the profits that you can make overall across the period of ownership you don't get distracted and you wait for the 80 and you try to make most of the profits and you get that into your portfolio into your financial success so extending your success happens only if you prepare to extend your success it is not an accident it will not happen suddenly it should start at the point of ideating the stock and that will help you stay invested and that will stop you from selling too soon try this for seven eight stocks across one market cycle and you will learn much more in that cycle than you learned across your investment experience so one must try to do something very differently learn what he needs to change about the way he invests stay exactly where you need to stay longer and invest only where you can stay longer that's the critical component that I believe will stop you from selling too soon when you buy very very high quality companies at very cheap valuations convince yourself that staying is equal to winning and that winning is equal to making tons of money that in essence is what every investor must condition himself towards and when you condition yourself towards that you're well prepared for big investment success thank you for watching this video,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

UfwO-1BMLk0, I'm all for stirring up the scene a bit welcome to the kov video and I'm happy to present you these controversial topics more specifically boxing papers Investments and unpolished now if you don't agree they might be in popular opinions I'm happy to hear why not before you hear all the facts and we're going to do so in my favorite strip joint clip Bunton oh [Music] starting off with something that actually has little to do with watches itself box and papers and people are usually surprised to hear luckily not as our response to their question if those are included with a watch we offer allow me to elaborate I would like to start with an important reservation I'm not saying you shouldn't buy a watch if it does come with the aforementioned additional accessories but I am saying that you should not let a deal depend on it let me take it one step further,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
UfwO-1BMLk0,I'd rather buy a watch without since it most likely have to pay less or I can use that budget on better condition or more interesting configuration after all I'm passionate about the actual watch not about some paper and a cardboard box it is up to you to decide to what extent you think I'm right but let's get the facts out there now I also understand that it can feel sketchy if a modern timepiece doesn't come as a full set by now most consumers in the luxury Market keep everything surrounding the object itself I wouldn't not buy a modern watch of everything else checked out but for some it might raise doubts however the habit of holding onto box and papers wasn't common at all until quite recently after all most people don't keep that stuff when they buy a vacuum cleaner for instance and same goes for warranty papers most threw it out after it expires since it didn't serve purpose anymore,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
UfwO-1BMLk0,moreover manufacturers did an intent for boxes to be kept for many years they were merely used as packaging material usually made of cheap and perishable materials like cardboard pleather and plywood just have a look at your average Patek Omega hours Ultra box from the previous Century you can almost see them disintegrate before your very eyes it is uncommon for someone to have kept the original boxing papers for decades and as per usual in the World of Watches if something is rare becomes desirable and that's valuable occasionally boxing papers can command premiums up to 25 percent most notably regarding vintage Rolex watches so are you being swindled if you decide to pay up firstly that's the bunker common misconception boxes nor papers guarantee originality they don't tell you whether a watch is in an altered condition or even genuine at all you could have a Rolex where the cereal matches the original papers but with all components of the watch being changed the dial could be a service placement it could be refinished or even completely aftermarket or Worse the serial number from the original papers could be re-engraved into any watch genuine or fake if the papers are indeed original in the first place well Swiss Precision is often copied but never duplicated the same can't be said of warranty papers or cards banknotes are created with all kinds of anti-counterfeiting features but there are still organizations out there that can fake them so well that most wouldn't be able to tell now imagine the money that can be made by counterfeiting a warranty paper that was never made in a way that would prevent people from Faking it I've held an original Rolex warranty certificate in my left and a fake one in my right hand and even I had difficulty separating them despite years of experience the fake paper even smelled vintage because they were kept in an old Book for a couple of months besides fake papers there are also many original papers that were just never filled out you can buy them by the Dozen at any watch fair or even online it'll cost you a couple of hundreds but can add thousands in value doesn't that sound ridiculous and before you start about the so-called punch papers from Rolex vintage punch machines have notoriously been sold online alongside dealer stamps which two are being duplicated in other words it's not that difficult to produce 100 correct papers and nobody will be able to prove they're not original just add a period correct box some booklets that you bought of eBay and voila you've successfully added some serious value to the watch after extensive research it's safe to assume at least half of the Rolex watches with paper produced prior to 1990 are currently supplied without the certificate they were actually born with therefore if anything regarding confidence being offered a vintage Rolex with papers makes me more suspicious some brands also offer extract services or even reports of authenticity this alongside service papers may be considered next up I would like to tackle the argument that a full set is a better investment the value in the secondary Market is a result of supply and demand whilst the supply of vintage watches with warranties magically increases the demand diminishes because people start to realize the scam resulting in a declining premium at best another often made excuse of limiting purchases to full sets is that it would be easier to sell after this plea you might consider that as arguable I'm also denying the claim of some the true collectors to see complete specimen hence the term collector set but all the aficionados we know,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

UfwO-1BMLk0,I think it's great many of us can enjoy such wonderful products often without losing money and occasionally even making a good Buck on it preferably to using your next purchase but it feels a bit poor to ultimately let that be the decisive Factor it strikes me as odd to think about the resale during your buying process of such an emotional purchase so do we as professional Watch dealers never buy watches as an investment trading watches is capital intensive so for us cash flow is King from time to time we purchase sleepers what we believe the market isn't aware of its importance yet and therefore is undervalued a lot of factors come into play to predict if and by what extent the market will pick this up but throughout our following we can create more appreciation and make Market in an ethical Way by advertising it as a so-called value buy rather than just following the market or even worse manipulating Market,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

UfwO-1BMLk0,so if you do want to get into it you have to realize the risks I'm no Financial advisor but happy to tell you about the pros and cons compared to traditional Investments let's start with the positive aspects first and foremost a watch is something you can enjoy physically if you were to invest in alternative assets like wine or whiskey the value it disappears once the bottle is opened watches might also be more accessible and enjoyable to learn about than the stock market and to many it has a more comprehensible intrinsic value lastly it is possibly more Anonymous and less transparent which might be interesting for tax purposes but the lack of transparency can also be a pitfall in the buying and selling process which brings us to the downside of investing in watches this asset class offers lower liquidity and higher costs like maintenance and transaction fees and risks it can get stolen or it can get ripped off if you don't have any knowledge and or trustworthy connections it also demands more Capital to start with a diversified and less volatile portfolio properly investing in watches whilst hatching as much risk as possible requires at least tens of thousands of Euros last but not least is something that is the most dangerous part but simultaneously the most attractive emotion and my heart and my wallet are oftentimes not cohesive my advice would be to buy what you like for the amount of watch it's worth to you then you can never lose  the market enjoy your watch the topic of unpolished is up next one of the most frequently asked questions is if a watch is unpolished in many cases asking this exposes your lack of expertise and experience nothing wrong if that does apply to you but there are many dealers out there trying to take advantage of gullible buyers some of you may be outraged or offended by this,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
UfwO-1BMLk0,but I'm spreading my views for protection purposes winning information prior to your purchase is the right thing to do and by extension asking the seller questions is a method that should be applied sensibly so let me explain why this isn't the right thing to ask when buying a vintage watch many have read somewhere the subject is relevant or even mandatory yet failed to realize that unpolished isn't a condition standard at all if you aim at a New Old Stock example it's wishful thinking for most popular brands tool watches especially disqualifying 99 of them and leaving a few exceptions in a different price bracket regardless a watch can be unpolished but worn out or properly polished but in pristine condition a resume rather the degree and quality of polishing is of importance over polished however is a condition standard and only let Specialists do the job some art designs are so skilled they can make it appear mint even Brands themselves offer laser recharge services like AP Patek some Rolex centers like Bexley and subsequently it sadly is sometimes advertises and Polished by the seller or some auction house it is very hard to determine the difference between truly unpolished and refurbished even if you have cognizance condition is of the utmost importance,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

kQQSQEGQN2s,but Canada's economy grew by more than expected in the first quarter upping odds of right hikes next week now the rate hikes are obviously a bit of a fear thing for Canada we'll get to that in a sec but the last major data point before Bank of Canada's decisions add fuel to the fire of speculation for more hikes needed the Canadian economy grew at an annual utilized rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter of 2023 statistics Canada reported Wednesday the latest data showed growth beat out the federal agency's own forecasts data of 2.5 percent for the quarter a preliminary estimate suggests the economy grew by .02 percent in April after remaining flat in March do you think this would be data that would push and Propel the markets higher hey data is pretty good but stubbornly High inflation is what's killing the economy now for a while there the Canadian economy was actually boating lower inflation than the US,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,I mean you take a look at coming into the new year here we were seeing like a much lower percentage points coming through the latter half of 2022 but lately coming into summer inflation has just been picking up and up and up and in the U.S it's kind of been a little bit staggered it's been up it's been down but it's a little lower well quite a bit lower at this point if we're continuing seeing these higher prices in Canada that you know why why is Canada's inflation out of control we're going to get to that in a moment but let's just kind of read this real quick because the Canadian economy has merged managed to continue outperforming expectations despite the Bank of Canada hoping High interest rates would cause a more profound pullback by consumers and businesses the household spending figures show spending up on both goods and services in the first three months the year after minimal growth in the previous two quarters however the report noted disposable income fell for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021.,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,the federal agency says disposable income declined by one percent largely due to expiration of government measures at helping people cope with inflation the Central Bank paused its rate hiking cycle earlier this year keeping at its key interest rates at 4.5 percent the highest it's been since 2007 but the central bank's Governor Tiff McLemore owned version of Jerome Powell you know the U.S federal reserve's head but he has signaled that the bank is still trying to figure out if interest rates are high enough to quash inflation the headline inflation rate ticked up slightly to 4.4 percent in April remaining well above the central bank's two percent Target why why isn't our interest rates higher I mean most people if you're not paying attention to it the U.S federal reserve you know a benchmark here their Federal Reserve rate is sitting at like just over five percent I mean they're over five percent they're getting back to where the the levels before they started cutting them in the 2008 financial crisis however the Canadian Benchmark right now our interest rate is sitting at just over four percent why did we stop raising rates,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,well I have speculation to this no one's going to tell you this but it has everything to do with Canadian housing Canada is a very expensive place to live the average sold price of a home is sitting around 716 000 which is down about four percent over the trailing 12 months it is up over the last month and something tells me this isn't going to last transaction volume is up over the last month but down 20 over the last 12 months and that's because we're in that cycle spring is a hot time that's when people throw their properties on the market that's when volume picks up a little bit so there's probably a little bit more aspersion when it comes to the prices maybe adjusting a little bit but that's going to cool down I think if they raise the rates yet again because you know the Benchmark price from MLS is still down 13 over the last 12 months,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,and I mean it is insanely expensive here in Toronto or Vancouver where the prices are still over a million dollars for the average cost of a home but the reason that I don't think they've raised the rates as quickly as the US is because mortgages are making up 75 percent of owed money which is basically the highest level of household debt in any G7 country mortgages make up the vast majority of Canadian debt I mean it's it's horrifying to consider that if you got a a dead almost zero interest rate one or two percent back in 2020 that you know that's either coming due this year or in 2025 if you've got a three or five year mortgage right and that and if your mortgage is over half a million dollars and that goes from two percent to five or six percent I mean you're damn you're talking about thirty thousand dollars just an annual interest payments alone I mean that's crazy right,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,and you know Tiff Macklin said we're in this transitional period where they're not going to lower rates back to zero so there's a lot of concern about affordability and housing I mean this isn't something that's going to spark a new housing boom by any metric so there's still a horrifying amount of concern and if they raise those interest rates again what that's going to mean for the housing market but I want to talk about the real reality of what's causing this hyperinflation now we're all sitting here as Canadians looking at crude prices fall off a cliff yeah when we go to the pumps it's still costing a lot to get gas here in Canada and in fact it's it's going to get more expensive to get gas how is it going to get more expensive when the price of fuel is going down because we are getting taxed our government uh which I oppose this I mean I think it's absolutely silly that our government is taxing our gas carbon tax,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,oh you know Canada we're definitely one of the highest carbon emitting countries on the planet let's not talk about India China or the US,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,hey you know we want a healthy economy we want to spark Innovation so we're going to charge people more money to get their gas this is like a snake eating its own tail here when we're talking about inflation look at this the federal government is imposing a second carbon tax for fuel regulation on July 1st 2023 that tax will increase the price of gas by up to 13 cents per liter uh you know by 2023 there's no rebates for the second carbon attacks here and and this is not good this this is not good for the fact that if they keep raising the price of gas in a time where we need lower inflation well basically everything from you know costing a building a house to getting food to stores you know everything all of it all of it keeps going up it just it's going to go up that's going to lead to higher costs it's going to lead to further in inflated markets then you get the Bank of Canada that's going to want to raise the interest rates again which is going to suppress the average person even more it's like it's our government is just squeezing our necks,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,[Applause] they don't have a plan for the future of the Canadian economy on this side we're investing in and leveraging technologies that are cutting emissions and creating good job and we're making sure that it's no longer free to pollute while giving Canadians money back your honorable leader of the opposition so the High School Drama teacher over here accuses others of liking the sounds of their own voices this from a guy who if he were made of chocolate he would eat himself I was a high school teacher before getting into politics I'm having a little [Applause] and uh yes and he left right in the middle of the semester and I'm having trouble remembering why this is this is not a question I want to answer what part of while somebody is speaking we sit quietly and listen do we not understand it's crazy that I feel like our politics are like a high school classroom so I think people don't understand that you know in the anticipation of rate hikes the market usually tends to cool off I'm hearing a lot of different controversial like articles,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,but I don't think people are really bringing in the full constride story of like what's driving this just Insanity in the Canadian markets now I'm always going to be a long-term bowler I love Canada I think it's a great place but we're going to see turmoil um that I don't think is comparable to many other countries just for the way it's our country set up,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
kQQSQEGQN2s,and I think Canadians if they continue to raise rates are going to go through a much harder time than most countries just because of the Mortgage Debt and if you do have a mortgage um you're gonna be one of those people that's going to be faced with a very real decision of either you're going to have to sell your house and go rent or go live somewhere cheaper or you're going to have to stomach this insane amount of interest rate hikes and in the next couple years if you don't have a variable rate you better really preparing your finances and putting money aside or putting much larger deposits or money down on your on your mortgage to try and get those rights as always possible before that ship when it was over but I'll pass that question off to you man I'd love to know what you guys think about this,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Zinl2sc6NS4, hi everyone welcome back and yes it's time for the June version of the best stocks to buy now folks these are the ones that I think are absolutely going to explode moving forward I got five fantastic high growth stocks I know there's some people out there don't need the wrist they don't want the risk probably not the video for you,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,but if you're someone looking for a stock that could double triple over the next year or two I think these stocks have that opportunity and we're going to discuss that moving forward now before we get into it make sure you take advantage of some of these things this is my patreon link down below you can see what stocks I'm buying and selling as you can see just did some the other day yesterday and I'm going to be looking to do more soon so come on over and join us links in the description you can see the the patreon and the private Discord as well as get your free stocks from MooMoo down below 100 deposit get you up to 10 stocks we'll get you 10 stocks worth up to two thousand dollars a piece and of course join the Weeble as well any deposit at all and you will get yourself up to 12 stocks worth of to thirty thousand six hundred even a dollar deposit,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,Now we move into it let's start with this let's take a look at the S&P500 right now and use this as our Benchmark we can see the S&P500 is up approximately 10 year to date are we going to break the 42.50 I don't know but it gives us an idea to look at the first of the best growth stocks to buy now folks I love it everything seems to be going right for this company now what do I mean by that because a lot of bad things are losing money no they're not have the earnings aren't there blah blah blah blah blah you hear all the the naysayers out there but I'm going to tell you something Sofi is the real deal I'm telling you I like where it's going right now and I believe that Sofi is now going to kick it into the next gear I feel that way about this sofa I just got the announcement for the student loan pause to be done and it's going to be done 60 days from the time time they signed a desk ceiling so it's done,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,and they can't bring it back that means that right now that money that so far is missing out on 60 days from now they're not missing out on it now so the Market's pricing that in I think they're they didn't price in enough so I'm looking to take a major position in this very soon and like I said if you want to come over to patreon file my portfolios links down below but this is the first of the best growth stocks to buy now they got their banking Charter they're getting the student loan thing finally taken care of permanently with the way they did it and so we see a lot of things happening we'll see if the Supreme Court okays the debt release for student loans that that bail out and if they do if they don't the good news is that the program is almost over for sofas now it's not all good news for those who have a student loans I get that but for the companies that deal with the student loans such as Sofi this could be a home run for them,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,and I do believe people say you said that so far I could get up to you know 100 up in a year or two yes to get back up to twelve dollars they just got to get to where they were at the the beginning of 2022. I think it's easily possible for Sofi to get back up there in the next year or two and we'll see at the end of this video I will come up and show you what the analysts on Wall Street believe I will give you the price predictions the so five price prediction we will see if these are the top Investments to make for 2023 especially in June I know what you're saying also don't you think there's going to be a recession coming Moe I do but I also think some stocks such as Sofi when you look at this thing have been beaten up so far that they're a limited downside in any positive Catalyst could actually propel them through a recession,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,and I think this is one of them companies that give us that opportunity not all companies are going to make it through a recession in terms of hey they didn't they went up well some of them are still going to get beat up it's just are they going to get beat up more than the market or not I think so far has that chance to actually outperform the market even with the recession the next of the best growth stocks to buy now the the top Investments to make look at DraftKings this year 110 up remember what I told you that draftking should be the leader when it comes to the sports wagering if anybody has files that that sector I believe that DraftKings was going to be your ultimate winner now you see this and you say mo that's a hundred and ten 110 up that's huge yeah,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,but if you go out to five years you see they are still trading 67 percent down from that top could they get back up there well if they did you would see this run uh probably about 200 percent up from where we're at now just to get back up to Prior hires could we see that we could I think that's a ways down the road but I think revisiting 40 here in the low 40s that we are at and the end of 2021 is not impossible to do so I do feel pretty good about that and I could see that happening in the next uh hopefully we see that happening in the next two years as the FED drops the race back down,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,I think a lot of money will flow back into the markets and these more risky stocks will get a lot of love and you could see them running up as they are newer companies growth companies and that's what I'm looking for we'll look at the DraftKings price prediction at the end of this video the next of the best growth stocks to buy now we got a volunteer out there and for those that don't know we know that Kathy Wood has been loading the boat with this one and there are quite a few YouTubers out there to file this stock as well they have gotten a lot of love and for good reason they're up 130 for the year and if you come out there go five years they're not they're nowhere close to where they were they're 58 down sort of reminds you of the DraftKings right and we know they got the AI tie-in the government contract tracks all the good stuff the question is will they return to their former glory and I do believe the answer is yes I think we could see this thing run back up,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,and we'll see how it does like I said but I did want to add this to the list of ones I'm looking to load up so when people hear me you guys hear me talking about this list of the best growth stocks to buy for 2023 in June these are the ones I will DCA into as we get through all these different moments in time there's no right answer to say hey when are you gonna buy when are you going to sell when are you gonna do this I don't have the crystal ball I wish I did but I don't have that DC crystal ball that a lot of people have so we got to come up with the strategies based on the data based on what the FED tells us that the fed's continuing to raise rates that's tough on growth companies so you got to be careful you don't want to load all up while the fed's still in quantitative tightening so I am watching all these events but it doesn't mean we can't start taking positions and then dcaing through it,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,but that's something we'll talk about the next of the best best growth stocks to buy now of course should be no surprise to anybody it is Tesla I absolutely love Tesla this thing gets 40 of its Revenue in China so the risk is China isn't doing as well as we thought they would be doing but they are doing quantitative easing which is big for Tesla but we are going to see recessions like I said before Germany's in a recession UK could be staring at one and this will affect Tesla in the U.S is staring at one will we see them in the second half of 2023 like a lot of analysts are predicting I think so as well so yes I think we will so it could be a bumpy road but dcaing through that bumpy road could help us now we look at Tesla take a look at the year down 20 percent but from the highs it's still down 50,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,so I gave you a few stocks that people were buying when they're at the highs now I give you a chance to look at these at 50 off or more from those highs and people will they walk away and it's always funny it's like when the stocks are high people want to jump open with both feet but when they get cut in half or even more they're like I don't want to touch that what's changed well they I know they increased the revenue and things are getting better,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,I don't want to touch it now though I want to wait till it's up another 100 200 before I jump back in and that's not the way to do it we got to make sure we are looking at these and taking advantage so it's up to you these are higher risks but one of the highest risks of the best stocks to buy now I have is coinbase why because obviously they're fighting it out with the government anytime I see that it is a big red flag to con to absolutely watch yourself there's no guarantees it's going to come out winning but if they do and I think they can we could see some good things they're trying to follow all the rules and regulations they just need to be told what they are all right and so we'll watch this over you can see from the high it's down about 82 percent uh year to date it is up 82 percent so there you go I like coinbase,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,and I believe the crypto industry will continue to absolutely explode moving forward especially once we get through quantitative tightening the money comes the the Fed rate comes down money gets cheaper people are throwing money everywhere we got a record amount of money on the sidelines right now outside of equities all I can see is crypto and equities especially some of these high growth just exploding higher once we get through this period of uncertainty such as the recession the FED tightening so once the FED finally gets into quantitative easing this is one of the stocks I think is going to explode up let's take a look at the price predictions out there and this is you can see these are top analysts on Wall Street they average them together,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,and you can see they have the Sofi price prediction 26 percent up now I absolutely love this I have the stock Mo patreon you can come over and check that out I'll be adding certain stocks when I'm buying and selling over there you can find that then the next of the best stocks to buy now of course we got DraftKings 24.52 percent upside potential according to the top analysts on Wall Street the next pollen tier 30 downside watch it if you think the top analysts know what they're talking about you stay away from this one now me personally I still like it,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
Zinl2sc6NS4,I think it has potential that's up to you uh but I'm just showing you what the analysts think the next we have Tesla they believe this has a huge 1.64 upside potential over the next 24 or the next 12 months I don't agree with that of course I think it's going to go much higher but you can look at it and coinbase they have a 3.73 downside projection for the coinbase price prediction over the next 12 months something to watch guys there is a lot of things going on out there with these stocks listen these are gross stocks I've shown you value stocks I've shown you dividend stocks now I'm showing you the five growth stocks I really like right now and so far is probably going to be one of the bigger ones I buy in the near future I already have Tesla but I like so far right now,overall_free_search.csv,1.0

a5ilc412kxA,so he was apparently selling order book info from some fund which is like what the fund is buying and selling as well as pre-released leaked earning reports of publicly traded companies the complaint says that eventually undercover irs and fbi agents signed up for a service to investigate so they subscribe to his insider trading tips netflix one of said agents signed up for the daily tips i guess they were a little stingy and started receiving these emails which had the ticker symbol of the stock and whether the trade should be a purchase position or a short position now it doesn't really say how profitable or accurate those daily tip emails were or if the information was completely legit,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
a5ilc412kxA,but it looks like travis eventually started upselling on his services charging people money for specific earning reports before they released and even looking to trade other people's money on august 1st 2017 at approximately 4 43 a.m pacific time he sent one of the agents this email about illumina's yet to be released earnings saying that the total revenue was going to be 662 million with a diluted earnings per share of 82 cents and nine hours later illumina announced its quarterly earnings during a conference call reporting a revenue of 662 million and a deluded earnings per share of 82 cents and so a day later on august 2nd 2017 illumina's stock price closed at 197 percent per share which was a 14.8 increase from the previous day's closing price so if you traded based off of that information you would have made a ton of money the proof was in the pudding with some of his other stuff like the hedge fund order book tips he was giving out i don't know if you can really prove that,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
a5ilc412kxA,but with this you can't really fake guessing the correct numbers of an earnings report before it's released that's clear insider info anyways eventually authorities arrested 30 year old travis and he's currently being prosecuted but the crazy thing is he's not an anomaly there's apparently a whole ecosystem of these groups and services out there and i want in i at least want to check it out the only thing i can't wrap my head around is if this travis guy had real insider info which the sec complaint says that he did why would you sell it for like 30 bucks a tip when you could easily compound an investment portfolio of like a thousand bucks into millions if you have insider information that's legit so i don't know but let's check this out by the way i don't encourage any of this entertainment investigation research purposes only i'm just fascinated by all of it and with this i looked up a tutorial on how to access the dark web which told me i needed to download a vpn service,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
a5ilc412kxA,so i did that it turned it on for what apparently was an extra layer of security then i downloaded something called the tor browser which also masks your ip and allows you to access the dark web and with just those two steps i was ready to go i don't know why i'm so nervous about this i've never accessed the dark web this feels mad illegal a little spooky but let's go ahead and start up this tour browser i began my journey on the dark web by visiting the hidden wiki that showed links to a lot of popular websites on the dark web well here i am on the alphabay market looking at a lot of illegal drugs i don't know if i could even show this on youtube wow this is crazy but i'm here for a different reason so let's go ahead and try to search for stocks okay so there's this listing which says how to make 131 grand in 21 days signals courses bots,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
a5ilc412kxA,but i don't know it doesn't say anything about insider info just looks like a regular signals group that you could probably buy on the regular web so let's keep digging i ended up going on a couple other marketplaces which offered social security numbers fake passports ids stolen credit cards all at the click of a button oh this is a different scheme you can invest into it's not even a scheme per se or rather an operation you can invest into which is illegal bitcoin mining using stolen electricity and they're offering 50 returns per month for 18 months this got to be some sort of fbi website there's no way this is real hear me out a crypto pump campaign i guess you deposit money into this website and they're gonna use your money to run crypto pump and dumps yeah me fair enough so none of the marketplaces i found really offered anything solid related to stocks or trading or investing so i dug deeper started going through search engines on the dark web and eventually stumbled upon this okay,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
a5ilc412kxA,i think we might have actually found something the stock insiders the only insider trading community on the dark web wow okay give it to me baby where where is the price of apple gonna go where do i look whoa this is nuts i just clicked on a section that says how to get paid for my insider info and it says that if you have a major announcement that's going to cause at least a 15 shift in the stock price they'll pay you up to 25 000 for your tip this is crazy so if you submit insider info about a listed stock on one of these exchanges at least one day before that info goes public for a minor announcement that's gonna ship the price at least four percent they'll pay up to five grand if it shifts the price at least seven percent ten grand and again if it's a major announcement they'll pay up to 25 000 okay i'm only clicking this for research purposes only,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
a5ilc412kxA,but i'm about to press the how to get a full membership button i'm putting it out there research purposes only man i guess we can get into this because in order to join this group you apparently have to provide some insider information that needs to be true in order to be accepted man stop playing with me what so i guess this is sort of like a sneaky club where people exchange insider information or again if you're just interested in selling it they'll apparently buy it off of you and they're always being salesy about convincing people to sell them information suppose you send us quarterly results you can earn up to a hundred thousand per year just for that not bad for just a few hours of work,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
a5ilc412kxA,huh so i couldn't access this insider's website but i also found websites that track stock market trades from politicians and executives at publicly traded companies which is kind of crazy but you can find that on the regular web it's not illegal because they're required by law to publish this info man i'm so curious if this is like a trap made by the cia to find out who's trying to sell their insider information or if this is really an underground insider trading range either way it's crazy that it exists if you have a friend uncle brother sister family member friend working at a publicly traded company and they have insider information make sure you drop that in the comment section below wait i'm just kidding don't i'm not soliciting insider information that was a joke stop typing hope you guys enjoyed this video and have an amazing rest of your day peace [Music] you,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8," How do I know when to buy a stock? What I wanna do here is share with you some basic day trading tips, and really just trading tips in general because this philosophy carries through no matter what you're trading. Now sure I use it for stocks, but even if you're doing futures or Forex or cryptocurrency, I mean this principle still applies. And right off the get go I wanna respect your time, if you are here searching for some sort of mind blowing secret little gem, you're not gonna get that. What I'm gonna talk about here is very very obvious, but in the world of trading and if you have any experience trading you know exactly what I mean when I say this, sometimes the most obvious things are the hardest things to actually do, and it's just because of the way our human mind is working. So at the core, the best time, when I know to buy and the way I want you to approach this in terms of okay, when do I actually buy a stock? When is it smart to be buying a stock?",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"When do I think I have the best chance to make money from the stock, not when it's going up. I get it, that sounds kind of bazaar, but yes I'm telling you if a stock is going up, do not buy. That is not the time to buy. Now that, there comes with a couple little nooks and crannies which I'm gonna explain here. But what do I mean? Well we have stock ABC, I know I got super creative with that name. And it's doing this. What I am telling you is the time to buy, how I know when to buy is not right there, is not right there, is not right there or not right there. No you're rightfully saying, I'm assuming but Clay, had you bought right there you would've made money. Had you bought right there you'd have made money. Bought right there you would have made money. Clay, that's how you make money, that's when you're supposed to buy a stock, when things are going down. I pulled a little mind trick on you though. What did I do? Well I gave you, I gave you total hindsight.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"You knew what the price was gonna be doing at that time. So of course it's easy to say you should've bought there, and you should've bought there and you should've bought there because I showed you what happened. And that's why books don't work, because books always just show you a picture and the book shows you everything that's already happened, so you have this confirmation bias. And what I did to you is I gave you the confirmation bias of showing you that well yeah, the price just goes up. So of course buying right there or buying right there. But in the real world of trading, this is how it appears. So we have ABC once again, and what you're gonna see is price goes up. So yeah, it's going up. But I don't know, do you buy right there? Well if you're saying no, the proper answer is no, you absolutely don't buy right there. You don't buy when stocks are going up. Why though? Because at this moment in time, there's really no way to manage risk. I mean it's very very hard to figure out okay where would I put a stop loss at?",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"What would my risk actually be? Now I suppose you could say well Clay, I'm gonna put my stop loss, actually, let me make this bigger so you can actually see what I'm actually, so I'm gonna make this so that's what that's representing. Now you could say well Clay, I'm gonna buy right there and I'll put my stop down there. And don't get me wrong, that's great, you're putting a stop loss in, but I mean look at all that. All that risk, I mean you're taking on quite a bit of risk there if you're just gonna put it all the way down there. And all it takes is for a couple of these to all of the sudden, I mean have you ever bought the top before? I mean I've bought the top before.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"But all it takes is for you to buy a couple of these tops and have it roll back over and take you out, and that's gonna be maybe, maybe a 50% overall win rate because for what you would have to get from a rewards standpoint in order to justify taking that risk, it's gonna be a very very difficult strategy to use. And sorry but there is more to trading than just finding a stock that's skyrocketing and just buying, and then putting the stop down below some area way way far below. All right Clay fine, I see what you mean, you don't wanna buy stocks when they're going up. So when do you buy them? When they're either going down or sideways, because as soon as a stock begins to move downwards, let me try a different color here. At least at that point you no longer have to worry about the dreaded C word of chasing. I've done videos on this time and time again, chasing will get you destroyed. And the reason chasing gets you destroyed is because the risk is so far off like we talked about.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"Now most people that are chasing, they probably don't even know what stop losses are. But even if you do know what a stop loss is, and you do apply stop losses, the risk is just still too big. So all it takes is a couple of those to wipe out a whole lot of wins. Now of course you could get a big winner where it just keeps on going and going and going, but like I said, that's not gonna be a sustainable strategy over the long haul. But as soon as this happens right here, the price goes down, that's when I know it's time to buy. Now not, I don't mean it in the sense of a price goes down and I just buy, but my point is that's when I know to start to get interested to buy. Or not necessarily down, maybe the price just starts to go sideways. Well at least at that point in time, okay, I'm not chasing, the price is at least starting to go sideways.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"And the reason why you should be interested when stock prices are either going down or sideways is because at that point managing risk, putting a trade plan together becomes that much more attractive. It becomes that much more risk-friendly. And that way you are gonna put yourself in the position, or even if you do take several losses, at least the losses aren't something like this where you're getting out way down here. You're gonna have a much better idea of where you should be putting stop losses, and those locations of the stop loss, you know the risk is gonna be dramatically reduced. Of course you always have the actually risk of losing, but the dollar amount associated with that loss will be much much less compared to just simply chasing the price and buying because hey it's going up, it's going up. Now the idea here is yes, you do wanna buy stocks when they go up. But you wanna find those areas within the trend where it's taking a breath.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"And when stocks take breaths, when stocks look like they're pulling back, well you know what, that's gonna give yourself a better odds over the long haul of being able to keep account growth going. Because sure, you can still lose, but it's not gonna be a situation where you just take some big old loss because things just plummet and plummet and plummet, but you also need to be careful because I get it, and it's a good point if you're thinking it, but Clay I mean, that sounds crazy. You wait for a stock to go down before you get interested? I mean what happens if that right there is the start of a big old reversal? Well that's fine, my point to you would be if it is a reversal, would you rather be buying the reversal right there or would you rather be buying the reversal right there? I mean who is gonna take a bigger beating? Well of course the person that bought up there right? Because they just got in way higher than the person that actually waited for it to pull back.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"So absolutely, a pullback can turn into a reversal, I'm not refuting that, I'm not saying this is the holy grail. But my point is just strictly from a risk perspective, the people that do wait for things to pull back, to cool off a little bit, people that do wait for it to at least go sideways, it becomes a lot easier to see where your risk should be, see where your stop loss should be, and yeah you could still lose money but not nearly as bad as those people that chased the stock. So that is where, that is really the core foundation to any sort of trade plan is you need to know when to at least get interested in a stock. And as counter-intuitive as it is, when a stock price is just going straight up, that's not the time to be interested. Now of course you could be interested in the sense of okay, I wanna watch it, but you should not be interested in the sense of I'm ready to buy. No, watch, and then wait and you need to wait for it to pull back.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"And it can be very difficult, because again, going back to this, you could be watching, and then it gets there, oh crap, I'm waiting for this thing to pull back. Oh my goodness, I could have bought right there and it still hasn't pulled back. And then oh man I, and that can get you in trouble. In fact, I'll put a link down below where I talk about the whole psychology of what's going on in this event. But I will say this, if you're watching something and you're waiting for a pullback and waiting for a pullback and waiting for a pullback and it just keeps going straight up, you're doing it the right way, well done. Sure there's people that are chasing and they're being rewarded for chasing, but all it takes is one where they buy the top, it reverses around, and let's face it, those people aren't using stop losses, and then it just keeps going down and down and down, and then all those times where they did buy and chase and had wins, they're all wiped away.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"I mean I've been doing this since 2013, working with traders, I've heard this story over and over again, I did it, if you're honest with yourself you probably did something like that too. So don't be frustrated. It's easy to get frustrated when you're just watching something go up and up and up, and you're sitting here, you're waiting for the pullback, you're waiting for that pullback, come on just give me a chance, let me manage my risk a little bit better. And it just keeps going up. The temptation is very real to buy, but don't do it. That's when you should not be buying stocks. So how do I know when? How should you know when to buy a stock? When it either pulls back or at least starts to go sideways. Sounds backwards, I get it, be interested, know when to buy a stock because it's going down?",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
Rn2BkivJpl8,"Yes, absolutely, and you wanna make sure you're doing this and approaching trading in a very risk aware type of way, and by waiting for these little simple things that's gonna be the linchpin that allows you to start to build on top of that a good quality risk based trade plan, and that's what trading is all about.

C3FyIev_f8s," I have some bad news for you… You are probably not going to be rich. Not a particularly positive message to start a video on but its something that people need to hear from time to time. Unfortunately, this is not something that most people want to hear, so there is no shortage of people out there that will tell you exactly the opposite, normally as a way to pitch you some kind of product. Now of course most of you watching know that the YouTube ads saying that you can earn 6 figures in a month by selling on Amazon, Forex trading, or flipping real estate are full of shit. But they still all follow a pretty similar routine, hey, you can get rich as long as you are willing to do XYZ while listening to the advice I give you! Again when it turns out that this advice is something that you have to pay for, most people get wise to the fact that it’s all just a massive scam. Of course some don’t, which is tragic and there really genuinely should be more done about this, but that’s a story for another time… or a coffeezilla video.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"Instead the focus of this video will be on a group of internet guru’s with much more influence, a much larger following, and much more credibility, the personal finance personalities. So it’s time to learn how money works and find out why you probably shouldn’t be learning to work your money like these popular youtubers might suggest. Now I want to preface this by saying that I personally enjoy watching people like Graham Stephan, Andre Jink, and from time to time even dave ramsey (as a guilty pleasure). None of these guys are outright nefarious scammers like the hustle bros you will see pitching an amazon automation course and this automatically makes them a million times better than this other group. What’s more is that they are genuinely entertaining, they give people a sneak peek into their own success while presenting relatively dry content in a way that is funny and easy to understand. The problem is though. Personal Finance should be boring. There is a common saying that everything you need to know about personal finance should be able to fit on a postcard, some authors have actually done it.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"But when you are committing to an upload schedule of a 15 minute video every single day of every single week you are going to run out of things on that post card to talk about. Now this is no good, because as these people will show you, they make millions of dollars a year from their daily video’s so they are not exactly going to turn around and say “oh well I have taught you everything you need to know now… so long and thanks for all the fish” Of course not that would be silly… and I am sure any one of us that is in there position would do the same thing that they are, which is riding that damn gravy train for as long as they can. But to do this they need to create more content than what this posted note can provide so they branch out into a few different broad categories. Personal Stories About Their Success Reactions Predictions And making up new lessons Now to start off with lets look at the least problematic of these formats, reaction video’s.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"Reaction videos are everywhere on youtube, and they they get a bit of a bad rap. But when you think about it this video format can range from absolutely terrible all the way to genuinely value adding and informative. The video’s that people like Graham or Kevin make are normally towards the good end. They will normally react to personal finance by watching video series like millennial money or they talk about high end real estate which is obviously an area of extensive expertise for these guys. There are other’s like Dave Ramsey who will do live reactions to people that call into the show and despite these being a bit repetitive they aren’t really doing any harm (apart from the ego’s of the callers) If you want to argue that these live interviews are not really reaction video’s just think to yourself, “am I watching this to see the solution to the persons problem, oooorrrrr am I watching this to smugly partake in Dave’s reaction to this persons situation?” Even still this is just a bit of light entertainment and who knows, maybe you will pick up a nugget of information along the way.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"No problems there, apart from when these reactions turn into predictions… Financial predictions are almost impossible to make… even the largest financial firms in the world filled with teams of PHD Quantitative Analysts struggle to outperform regular market returns consistently, if at all. It’s therefore frustrating to see someone like Meet Kevin, make predictions about the future of a highly volatile stock like Tesla before his audience… and yes I know… he gives the standard disclaimer “that this is not financial advice”, but when a supposably reputable figure that positions themselves as a personal finance expert brings up an official looking spreadsheet and predicts 100% within the next 12 months… well it’s not unrealistic to see how some of his impressionable audience would follow his not advice. Now this is just one of the most blatant examples, but all of these personal finance personalities is guilty of giving these “not advice” pieces of advice throughout their content. This can range anywhere from invest into dividend stocks, all the way up to only buy a duplex and rent out the other side.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"Both pieces of advice that are not necessarily bad, but are just grossly overgeneralised and make no accommodations for the financial situations of their viewers. Now my friend Richard over at the plain bagel actually made a video earlier this week that explored the issue of picking stocks from the perspective of an actual financial professional who’s job it is to pick stock for clients. I was actually considering not making this video at all after seeing that one because I thought Mr Bagel made a pretty fair and well rounded argument against this all… but then…. I saw this… Alright, this is where the serious issues start. Making up new rules for people to follow. I hate to be the one to break it to you, and I truly do mean this in the nicest possible way. But Graham Stephan is a ex real estate agent and social media influencer, HE DOES NOT KNOW the 5 best investments to make you rich. For that matter, nobody knows any investments that will make you rich, and if they did they sure wouldn’t be sharing them on a YouTube video.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"Despite popular opinions these days, good investments should not double overnight, they “should instead” continually provide value over many years or decades and return that value back to the investor steadily over the same time period. The generally accepted rate of return for a well-diversified portfolio is anywhere between 6% all the way up to 12% if your doing really well. The bad news here is that this is not going to make you rich, just like we said at the beginning of the vide. Well actually it’s not going to make you rich unless you have a decent income already and are very disciplined about consistently contributing to this portfolio over a long enough time period for compound interest to do it’s thing. Even then it will make you old and rich, which is not what the people want… What they want is to hear about how the people talking to them got so rich. Which is where we get to the last type of concerning content… Personal Stories about their success. Now who doesn’t love a good success story, especially when it’s the tale of a scrappy underdog proving all the naysayers wrong.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"Which is something most of these guys have. Graham didn’t get into university, Meet Kevin started from less than a thousand dollars, Dave Ramsey went totally bankrupt and the same is true for the rest of them, none are turning around and saying I studied like crazy through high school, got into a good university then became a doctor or an investment banker. Why? Well because it’s much more entertaining, and it sounds much more attainable to the average viewer. And whether we like to admit it to ourselves or not, there is an element of; “If I watch these video’s I will learn to do what he did” Now that’s not to say these back stories are all a lie, but more so they are just the product of survivorship bias. For every Dave, Graham and Kevin, there are thousands of people that didn’t have the unique set of skills and the luck to break into the incredibly lucrative roles they found themselves in.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"Sure graham didn’t go to university, but he did work his way into an incredibly prestigious real estate firm, so what he lacked in book smarts were obviously more than made up for with personal branding and good old fashioned sales ability. If you are a fantastic salesman then sure go ahead. There is actually a widely accepted array of high paying jobs with varying levels of effort to certainty. Sales sits somewhere towards the riskier side of this array. Something that is very high effort would be becoming a surgeon or a dentist, it takes years and years in medical school, but once you are practicing you are all but garunteed a high income and standard of living for the rest of your life. Of course at the other end of the spectrum is something like “becoming a Rockstar, or famous actor, or yeah even a youtuber….” It doesn’t take too much effort when compared to years in med school, or 100 hour weeks in an investment bank but it’s also incredibly unlikely to pay off.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"Whether they do it intentionally or not the “personal finance personalities” perpetuate the narrative of dropping out of school and building your own destiny, which has worked for them, but will not work for most people. It also sounds eerily familiar to the promises made by the more despicable side of the financial gurus… Now there is one last problem with these personal back stories, and that is that they are used to justify all of these other pieces of content. To demonstrate this we are once again going to pick on Meet Kevin. One of his most popular video’s is the tale of how he built up his property portfolio from $0 to 5.5 million dollars by the age of 27. You are welcome to go and watch the video but the TLDR is that through a series of flips and equity releases he built up a highly leveraged position of real estate assets that were cash flow positive. Sounds great, but it is ridiculously risky.",overall_free_search.csv,0.0
C3FyIev_f8s,"Take out 5:1 leveraged position in the stock market and most people will think you lost your mind, but take out a 10:1 leveraged position on a house, and you are an investment genius. Most people don’t realise how risky real estate can be. Now of course Kevin was lucky, he started investing at the start of one of the longest real estate bull runs in history and in his defence he has deleveraged his position significantly since, but this is the DEFINITION of survivorship bias. Nobody is making a video about how they lost their life savings trying to flip homes. Had Kevin started his investment journey in 2004, he certainly wouldn’t be telling stories of financial success on youtube, if anything he would be lucky to be an extra on the Big Short.

mzZI61kL2sc, folks we've got a lot to discuss number one we gotta give an update on the market and plays including one of our plays that went up a hundred plus percentage points this morning and then for the main entree I need to present our latest top idea ticker symbol you you you you is Universal Security instrument and it is in the security products and home alarm space it is a small cap stock with sales that are far far greater than market cap it is a profitable company it has assets that are way higher than market cap and it's super low float the company also has not diluted in a very long time,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
mzZI61kL2sc,and I see no reason for them to break that Trend this is a stock that you should put on your radar and start doing your due diligence on as fast as possible and if this is your first time here you should know that our top idea designation is the highest designation that we can bestow on a stock the other top ideas that we have had this year have been very very successful ranging from 44 up to 156 percent up in Max returns from alert price to Peak and averaging at 97.82 percent now of course it is difficult to catch the maximum move because you're not going to time things perfectly and past performance is not indicative of future returns but all I'm saying here is that we take our research very very seriously and you can tell based on the numbers that our previous picks have done and today's top idea I think is one of the most exciting on the list,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mzZI61kL2sc,okay let's go ahead and get to work so we'll start with the market market started June in the green with the s p 5 hundo finishing 0.99 up your triple Q up about 1.16 percent this is largely due to de-risking over debt ceiling concerns as the bill moves through Congress but what is really impressive right now are all the big massive runners in the small cap space so many small caps are doing big rally ralitos and of course Charlie Charlie is always looking for that next rally rally tow so that you can grow your Wally walito and I believe that a big reason you're seeing so many small cap stocks run huge is because we are coming back from basically 12 to 18 months of small caps getting unanimously hammered no questions asked and now that broader markets are rallying well a lot of these Beatdown small caps are being rediscovered and going parabolic there are so many hidden gems beneath the surface right now that did not deserve to be beat down 99 in many cases from 2021 to 2022,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mzZI61kL2sc,and now we're able to Rally three four five even 10x and still and still be well below where they were in 2021. many of which actually have a good business behind them just didn't want to be acknowledged because of the terrible macro situation in terms of fed raising interest rates and people going risk off so aggressively the last 18 months building on to that let's go over the latest on place so we did have a massive winner this morning ticker symbol you car ucar we briefed on yukar at about 5 13 a share this morning and it ran up to 11 30 a couple hours after market open that's a total run of about 120 briefing price to Highs but why did we brief on it Charlie Charlie too well it had exciting partnership news yukar,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mzZI61kL2sc,AKA you power announced a cooperation partnership so Cooperative with Quantum Solutions Quantum Solutions is a Japanese electric vehicle maker with a market cap of around 10.81 billion billion dollars and as you know small cap companies partnering with much bigger companies tend to have big big rallies as a result of that news announcement MarketWatch reported quote you power said it plans to work with Quantum to develop business initiatives related to marketing research and development of new energy Vehicles Financial Technologies battery Banks EV charging and Battery swapping operations and services in Japan you power set the company's plan to recruit other partners in the field of new energy storage such as battery developers and that they may establish a joint venture to further pursue the cooperation so not only is ucar getting a ton of press from this but they're also showing a lot of proof of concept in their Tech if they're partnering with this big big company and they are leaving the door open here to more partnership catalysts as they said they're planning to recruit other partners,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
mzZI61kL2sc,right so lots of things here that has caused this to run and get a lot of excitement in the stock so if you missed this stock in this trade what is the lesson here what can you take away from this well always look for stocks in the pre-market that have dropped partnership news the smaller the company you are trading and the bigger the company that it is partnering with the bigger the Run could be right and if you would like some help scouting out these plays in Catalyst I will put a link to zip Trader you down below and we'd love to have you in our daily morning briefings again this was one that we briefed on pretty early coupon code Memorial 50 will get you 50 off before checkout and that expires at the end of the week okay next wlds so wlds has been a big Runner as well for full context we originally briefed on this bad bad girl back on the 25th at about 58 cents a share and as of this morning it hit 2.36 that's a 306 percent run week over week briefing price to highs pretty insane especially considering the Catalyst wasn't even that great essentially this is running on the process of getting their mudra band for their Apple watch to Market,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mzZI61kL2sc,I think people just want to buy Runners at this point we are back in this market where folks they aren't really concerned about the businesses what the underlying fundamentals look like they just want to make money and I am all for that I'm not complaining at all but you got to be very very careful this play has been very very successful but like I said at the last cycle hi this is very very very over bought sure it looks like it's primed to break out even higher and the momentum is pretty strong but at the end of the day this is going to drop like a rock so if you're going to continue playing this momentum my suggestion is have very very tight risk management these plays are very very fun,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mzZI61kL2sc,but if you marry them if you marry them and you have 15 kids with them it's going to be a bad time it's going to be a disaster next an update on AI so we covered the short squeeze setup on AI earlier this week here on the channel and how we would in all likelihood get a judo chop to the share price and after that bottoms would start forming and so far the bottom looks to be in around the 30 dollar range and change and we'll see what happens but in terms of a short setup interestingly enough shorts are actually further accelerating their position short interest has popped up back to 29.69 percent a couple of days ago it was only at 26 percent so shorts are actually using this downtrend here to dump more and kneecap the momentum before it gets picking up again my guess is they probably dumped a ton after earnings which the earnings were never going to live up to the share price because the stock had gone up 200 plus percent on the year here so I think what short sellers did is they're like okay well,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mzZI61kL2sc,hey it's not going to measure up let's plan to dump a ton a ton of share shorts right at earnings release that's going to panic everybody else that they're gonna think oh the earnings were a disaster for the stock the Stock's going out of business the company's going out of business and they're going to panic sell and that's exactly what happened and I think they did a pretty damn good job however the problem is that if it does pick up in momentum again you could very very well see a much bigger squeeze now and in effect wherever and whenever this Bottom's probably somewhere around 30 or 25 by early next week I'm expecting to see another cycle to the upside similar to the stair-step patterns we've had throughout the entire uptrend I could be wrong it wouldn't be the first or the last time I've been wrong but but that is the operating thesis at this point,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mzZI61kL2sc,okay now it is time for today's main entree triple U and before we even get into it I do want to remind you to always make sure to do your own due diligence and risk management our channel is all about publishing ideas for you to go out and analyze yourself and take value away from some of them you're going to like some of them you won't like and also remember what has happened historically all of our top ideas have had huge trading opportunities but but very very short term that's why they are trade ideas not long-term investment ideas not marriage ideas if you look at the spreadsheet of our other top ideas this year they've had again an average Max return at roughly 97.82 but you got to realize that most of them hit their peaks about one to three days after their call out so again make sure that you're looking at these from a short-term trading perspective there are a lot of inefficiencies in this market there are a lot of catalysts in this market but very very few of them stick and stick for long periods of time and who really even cares if they stick for long periods of time we want stocks that can move now not stocks that can move 35 years from now anyways let's go ahead and get to work so uu is Universal Security Instruments and it is in the security products and home alarm space they sell these smoke and fire alarms hopefully they aren't the ones that run out of battery and beep when you're trying to sleep in the middle of the damn night if they were then that'd be enough to short the stock for sure just kidding,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

mzZI61kL2sc,well I agree it is very very boring but but boring companies are very very easy to understand and very very easy to spot pricing and efficiencies you pull up their reported numbers they reported 16.25 million in sales for the nine months ended December 31st for a full year you were looking at something like 20 million in sales with the company trading at a market cap of about 5.39 million so that means in other words that this company is selling about four times about four times their market cap every year you go over to their assets you're looking at 9.34 million in total assets they put their current liabilities at about 4 million which leaves you at about 5.2 million net in literal asset value right which destroys the argument that this is trading at a huge huge premium it simply isn't most small cap stocks are not only trading way way above one-time sales they're trading at like 10 15 time sales,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
mzZI61kL2sc,well guess what has happened since then while China has almost fully reopened and Long Beach congestion is almost completely gone on top of that a lot of the other costs have come down in terms of fright they've dropped off a cliff advertising costs have also dropped off a cliff so numbers should look even better in future reports for this company going back to the Chart well despite the company looking better than it has in years despite the company trading at like one-fourth yearly sales and despite the company's business model being profitable well the stock is trading at a fraction a fraction of what it was during the highs Last Summer and when it was at these highs last summer that was a bad period of time for small caps right now is a much better time for small caps look at some other periods of time mid-2021 it was trading at 9 55 at highs early 2021 it was trading at 1988 at highs probably holding closer to 10 if you adjust for liquidity so the point here folks if you look at the stock objectively it's a stock that has gotten beaten down with all the other small caps the last year plus and markets haven't wanted to question that beat down,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mzZI61kL2sc,because ooh it's a small cap that means scary that means bad but but guess what markets are rallying higher and higher so folks I would start your due diligence on this one I would look at the business I would look at the trend I would look at where this was trading during other periods of time and how much weaker their business model was back then despite the fact that their stock was so much higher and then look at where the stock is right now and compare it because I think there's a big pricing and efficiency here and also by the way if you want to be the first to hear about our top ideas like this play you you well we do post them for zip Trader you Members First in zip parade review in our private Discord which comes with the program this morning we posted about triple U at 10 19 a.m Charlie California time and the stock was trading at about 193 at that time the stock is now trading at around 230 to 240.,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

LtgU3RtAW7M,you are now making easy money with Obi [Music] what's going on YouTube and what's going on to all you Savvy investors out there welcome back to the making Easy Money YouTube channel where our main focusing goal is to make money in the stock market and what we came to discuss here in today's video is Mother stock and as you all know the entire auto manufacturer sector as a whole is seeing a pretty green day here so far up 2.55 as a whole and if we take a brief look and check out mulling we can give most of that credit due to Tesla because that's the big fish in the sector but as you guys know um we're currently facing some current downwards pressure here on that extra large scale which points to hedge funds and or institutional presence now as you guys know huge outflow and favorment can and more than often point to Short Selling and as you guys see here on the extra large scale we do see massive outflow early into days trading day that lets us know shorts did load this boat within the first five minutes of trading now as you all know today we are not short sale restricted ladies and gentlemen,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
LtgU3RtAW7M,um no I take that back yes we are we did fall SSR here yesterday dropping as low as 68 cents so,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
LtgU3RtAW7M,that means we do face an entire day of short sale restricted that doesn't mean any short shares aren't available that just means those short orders will have to be filled on the uptick now I know a lot of people are wondering and speculating will June be a better month month for mullet and I am here to tell everyone I truly believe so due to the fact that we shouldn't see speculative buying rolling into the play here pretty soon in speculation of those class three chassis going in production here in July now like if I've been telling everyone um if you have been keeping up the channel Mullen has one more wild card and we're not talking about maeo ladies and gentlemen we're talking about Mullins solid polymer State Technology and that is a battery technology that is said it can get the mother five up to 600 miles plus on Range per charge and it can charge up to 50 percent in just 18 minutes alone and this is the type of battery technology that compete that competition cannot compete with now at the end of this year we should get some more testing results in the year 2024 with that Battery Technology going into the vehicles now so far the Battery Technology is only fitted for the Mullen 5 they haven't said anything about the Bollinger products nor their class um nor their cargo vans ladies and gentlemen but it is said once you put these two things together we're talking about the silent polymer State Battery as well as m-a-e-o Lawrence harges Technology you combine those together guys and you will get in range over a thousand miles per charge and the reason why this is um and the reason why this is achievable is because Lawrence hardest technology makes it 75 percent more efficient than without his technology guys and teaming that up with the solid polymer State Battery guys you have a major wild card on your hands now Mullen is a 51 shareholder in maeo which means they are a controlling state but they did give Lawrence Hearts the goal to make um decisions when it comes to m-a-e-o now that everything is behind us ladies and gentlemen what is in front of us is this major production announcement now that alone isn't going to set Mullen on the right path but it is going to shed light in the right direction for sure we know for a fact that Randy Marion deliveries and orders is a huge step for Mullen if you ask me that is a step on the moon not say it's it's going to the moon but that was a huge milestone for a company like mullet also guys just to be fair Mullen is currently facing bankruptcy not in the very near future,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
LtgU3RtAW7M,but we're talking about within the next year at this rate now one thing that can save them and I do believe that they may do this it's a 90 chance this will happen ladies and gentlemen due to the fact that they did push back the production of the Mullen five I do see them actually leasing out that facility to one of these startup EV companies just to bring in some Revenue ladies and gentlemen so they will not have to dilute as you guys know they don't have many shares left to dilute slightly over 10 million shares left to go and that isn't a lot when your company is only a see a market cap of 125.95 million and a share price of 73 I do believe they will not want to take that route,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
LtgU3RtAW7M,and they're going to lean towards leasing out one of their facilities now with that being said guys is this the time to buy Mullins stock I do consider grabbing a small position here early in the month of June may be a great idea but far as jumping off the deep end I would just wait until the announcement that production has started for those chassis ladies and gentlemen now with Mullen actually focusing on this commercial vehicles they will in fact have an edge over these other startup EV companies due to the fact that we all know that these major auto manufacturers has an edge when it comes to getting their cars to the market due to the fact they already have the real estate they already have these dealerships on every single corner and I'm talking about your Chevy dealerships your Buick the list goes on anything under the General Motors umbrella also Ford has car lots everywhere so getting their product to Market is much much faster for these major your auto manufacturers not only that their production capability allows them to sell their cars a little bit cheaper than what these startup EV companies are going to have to deal with also we already know cars sell off of culture and a loyal fan base so for instance a lawyer or a doctor that continues to drive Mercedes-Benz and when they want to convert over to EV now they have their electric Mercedes-Benz available ladies and gentlemen that is why I feel as though that Mullen will not win the war when it comes to general purpose vehicles but with them actually focusing on their commercial side of things that is currently a untapped market and it has huge huge potential we can see these type of things apply to distribution centers ladies and gentlemen warehouses and much much more especially Mullins Battery Technology last year the CEO did make a statement saying that they are in talks with OEM companies about their Battery Technology and we're about the solid polymer State Battery ladies and gentlemen not m-a-e-o and the CEO said they are in talks with Outsourcing that technology to OEM companies and that is the type of companies guys like the electric pallet jacks we might be able to find that Battery Technology in if Mullen wants to Outsource it to them um reach trucks uh forklifts the list goes on guys uh Mullen has a octopus style reach they can actually do a lot of things once this solid polymer State Battery Technology is completely looked over completely reviewed and um and we get all the data and feedback off of that guys I believe that that is going to be mullen's wild card for sure so with that being said guys if you agree with anything I said in this video can you please leave a thumbs up on it also if you're new to the channel consider hitting that subscribe button make sure you have all post notifications set to also you will be alerted each and every time I create one of these videos and may the games be with you,overall_free_search.csv,1.0

CIqGum3wn6Y, why do I hold Dent because Dent is the chosen one to revolutionize the global mobile data market helping to operationalize the most prioritized action of the United Nations 17 sustainable development goals an agenda set to receive trillions of dollars before 2030. the sdg's agenda is the un's official roadmap for Global Innovation like a big to-do's list for the New World Order and to me this agenda is the best place to look for long-term Investments because the wealthiest most powerful organizations on Earth are all backing it making its success seem kind of inevitable so what's dent and how is it connected to the sdgs,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
CIqGum3wn6Y,well first there's a token tent coin an exchange Dent exchange and a company Dent Wireless Dent Wireless is the world's first digital and Global mobile operator and the dent exchange is the first Global Marketplace for mobile data dense mission is to liberate the mobile data market by tokenizing data itself allowing customers to buy sell or donate data on demand through esim technology what's esem esim is the new industry standard digital Sim set to replace the obsolete physical Sim that will allow users to activate cellular Plans remotely and without traditional contracts esim is one of the most crucial Technologies needed for enabling the internet of things and will be in billions of connected devices in the future and it won't just be phones that need data before esim the only way to get mobile data was through corporations who'd lock people into expensive monthly contracts which meant they had no control over their data if they used too much they paid fees if they had a surplus they couldn't sell it basically until esim there was no easy way to buy the precise amount of data you personally consumed and there was no affordable way for people in least developed countries to easily activate mobile devices where Modern infrastructure didn't yet exist enter esim and Dent with the prediction that esim would eventually be the global standard Dent Wireless created a future ecosystem for the sale of mobile data utilizing the infrastructure of existing telcos debt enables mobile operators to sell competitive data packages on the dent app through Dent coin while simultaneously allowing users to sell or donate their unused data on the dent exchange effectively unlocking the unsold data market for the first time which by the way is an enormous untapped Market in the words of co-founder Miko linamaki data is sold in silos per operator and usually in fixed denominations so either the user uses too little and loses the remain at the end of the billing cycle or they use too much and have to pay excess charges as an example of just 15 percent of data sold goes unused a whopping 4.8 billion dollars of value is virtually forfeit using its partner telcos like a union and leveraging their Collective buying power the dent esim Marketplace built on blockchain has the power to one day establish a free market value for Global Digital Data making it more affordable and accessible for all now back to the sdgs think about it if you're the world's most powerful organizations,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
CIqGum3wn6Y,unwef Etc and you need to spread a bunch of global propaganda for your One World Vision to succeed that's not going to be possible if billions of people still aren't connected to the internet this makes mobile internet access and affordable data in least developed countries the most prioritized action of the sdgs but don't take it from me take it from gsma the global systems for mobile Communications Association which is the industry's largest Telco Forum they State mobile technology will be at the center of efforts to achieve the sdgs it's worth noting gsma is directly partnered with the UN and works with them on many sdgs initiatives it's also worth noting they're partnered with dent and this might give us our first clue into how debt was able to sign so many Partnerships so rapidly in so many countries because in total of the 109 mobile operators Dennis partnered with 91 are official members of gsma and since we know dense use case perfectly aligns with the sdgs and we know gsma is directly working on the sdgs with the UN it would definitely make sense that they'd be interested in a platform like dense remember to make the internet more affordable and accessible for all mostly means bringing it to those who don't have it yet and these people are likely living in one of 46 countries on the un's least developed countries list well through the Partnerships mentioned dentists already able to provide data top-ups to nearly 70 percent of those countries so you have gsma a direct un partner appearing to help integrate a future decentralized Marketplace for mobile data Dent into every least developed country in an effort to improve internet access which is coincidentally the most prioritized goal of the un's sdgs that gsma is actively working toward makes enough sense to me and since we're on the topic of things obviously being connected to the UN as part of dense Ico Dent actually pledged 1 billion tokens one percent of the total supply to the un's sdgs targeted at implementation of modern telecommunications infrastructure in developing countries pay attention to those words implementing infrastructure sounds a lot like the other co-founder of tarot katajanan's previous job is mobile systems Development Associate for a un office that literally describes itself as dedicated to implementing infrastructure for the United Nations system and look at the timing of it all tarot privately starts dent in 2014 starts working at the UN on implementing infrastructure projects for the UN system in January 2017 and then months later denco's public in July of that same year and speaking of implementing infrastructure that is exactly what sdg number nine and its sub targets are explicitly about to facilitate sustainable infrastructure development for developing countries and universal access to information and Communications technology clearly Dent was created for the sdgs remember and I'll say it again the un can't achieve the sdgs without affordable accessible internet for all because without it educating people around the world with Perpetual inescapable propaganda would be impossible this is where sdg number four comes in quality education sdg4 aims to provide children and young people with quality and easy access to propaganda I'm sorry education but notice what the UN says is the main cause for the current lack of quality Global education lack of Internet access they write lack of Internet access reduces paths to a world of information available online and limits the potential to learn and grow icts which are information and communication Technologies and the internet are critical enablers of the sdgs providing unprecedented social and economic benefits for millions of people around the world notably they support sdg4 and 5.,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
CIqGum3wn6Y,now it takes a little less convincing that dun's working on sdg number four because the basic internet Foundation literally spells it out stating that they in partnership with end are contributing directly to the United Nations sdg4 with basic Digital Services this statement comes from the bif website after they successfully connected 50 000 students in rural Kenya to the internet in 2021 alongside dent I posted a video you can watch on my Twitter of Secretary General of the bif Joseph Knoll stating in a presentation that because of this Project's success they're now meeting with the UN monthly discussing a plan to scale up to the National framework to bring internet to every school in Kenya and Beyond and it's then revealed the next countries they're targeting are Tanzania and Ethiopia with 200 schools already funded for development and a goal of 5 000 schools connected by the end of 2023. clearly the UN is aware of Dent,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

lS3tYOn7qBQ,more than just chat GPT artificial intelligence is the driver behind nearly every other transformative technology from robotics to genomic sequencing internet of things and self-driving that could cause demand for AI software and Hardware to more than triple the Wall Street estimates to a 15 trillion dollar market by 2030 and create an 87 trillion dollar Enterprise opportunity for stocks in the space almost 35 times the current value hey bowtie Nation Joseph Hulk here and I found five top AI stocks you need to be watching not only will I show you how to find these but a reason to invest you probably haven't thought about now I want to start our list with three AI funds first because buying into one of these is going to give you that broad exposure across the theme helping you benefit from that runaway growth across artificial intelligence but also because it's a great way to drill down and find other stocks to buy in that theme we'll look at three ETFs here all focused on that Robotics and AI theme how they're set up and how to use them to find find other AI stocks to watch the largest here is the globalx Robotics and AI ETF ticker botz a fund of 44 stocks up 25 so far this year I'll break down the Holdings of all three ETFs together for this but this is probably the most focused of the three funds next the robo Global Robotics and automation ETF ticker Robo a fund of 79 stocks is up 15 so far this year it's a little more geared towards that industrial use side of AI and is quite a bit more expensive than the other two funds at 0.95 expense ratio,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
lS3tYOn7qBQ,so I'll mostly just be using this one to mine the stock picks instead of investing directly in the fund then the ishares Robotics and AI ETF ticker irbo is the smallest fund at just 303 million dollars market cap but the broadest of the three holding 116 stocks this one is also up 15 since January but I thought I had some questionable choices like the fund managers kind of stretching trying to say that stocks like Netflix and Spotify should be in an AI fund again again each of these is going to give you that broad exposure but more importantly you can go to Holdings here on their website and download a full list of all the stocks in each fund it's the fastest way to find those individual stocks in a theme that you might want to research further I combined that list of stocks and found just nine stocks in all three ETFs with only seven of those traded in the US exchanges now several of these are more robotics focused than AI,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
lS3tYOn7qBQ,but it's a great way to start finding your companies to watch the global X botz and then that Robo ETF each have about half their stocks from foreign companies stocks us investors normally wouldn't get access to so that's a big plus for that broader exposure to the global AI theme you can also use the fund weight data on these the percentage of the fund invested in each stock to get that sense of the confidence the fund manager has in each stock so using this and then other research we can start to narrow down our list of four other stocks to give us that targeted exposure to specific companies and we can't talk AI without Microsoft ticker msft and early investor into open AI Mr Softy was one of the First Investors in open AI with a one billion dollar investment in 2019 that has now added another 12 billion into the company an evaluation of the startup at 29 billion dollars not only does Microsoft participate in that potential returns to the company's growth,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
lS3tYOn7qBQ,but it's also the exclusive provider of computing power for openai research products and interfaces for developers that's going to mean a boom in demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud services remember it was open ai's chat GPT that sparked that race in AI this year and now Microsoft is integrating the technology into Bing search sales marketing as well as Office 365 products with Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turin estimating it could add over 30 billion dollars in new revenue for Microsoft's cloud services alone now the problem for Microsoft and its investors here is that openai was set up as a capped profit entity after its startup as a non-profit now that means returns are restricted to 100x their money for early investors and even less for later investors like Microsoft any profits beyond that go back into the non-profit side of the business but that still does leave lots of room for upside for Microsoft not just in integrating those AI tools across its products but also that return on investment but Shares are already trading a little expensive here at 33 times on a price to earnings basis and and is a 2.3 trillion dollar company we're talking about here for Microsoft to even 10x your investment it would have to come close to the size of the entire U.S economy,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
lS3tYOn7qBQ,so I want to be looking for some smaller undiscovered plays in the AI theme as well and one of the most interesting opportunities on the list is anthropic founded by X openai employees and where the biggest worry today is that public use of AI and potentially negative outcomes anthropic is focused on safety in artificial intelligence now anthropic launched Claude a cloud gbt competitor in March with the expressed intent to avoid some of those harmful outputs and safety issues that we've seen with open ai's chat GPT and the language model uses a constitutional AI framework to guide the output in kind of a subjectively safer and more helpful Direction in essence Claude has been called the AI with a moral compass in effect it's built a system that is less likely to produce that harmful output it's easier to hold a conversation with and easier to use with less effort so while chat gbt may still be better for tasks such as programmer coding and generation anthropic's Claude could become a more human-centered chat system anthropic was founded by openai's former vice president of research Dario emodi and Tom Brown its lead engineer for AI language model,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

hyBAMxO6H1M,but but I also don't need it to get halfway there in order for this to be an incredible gainer in my portfolio and I absolutely think it is trading significantly undervalued now I hear all you guys in advance who are going to scream at me saying Luke it's been down for over a year now it's gone nowhere why would you continue to put money it's clearly a loser because it hadn't gone anywhere for a year year and a half or so I guess we're not quite to a year and a half here but we're well past a year now in regards to not going anywhere why would you keep putting money into that does that isn't that stock a loser and my response to you is during the greatest bull market of all time this past bull market we just had the greatest bull market of all time Tesla traded flat for six years Apple perhaps the greatest company during this bull run traded flat for six months at a time sometimes a year a little bit more,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hyBAMxO6H1M,than a year I can say the same for Microsoft for Google for Amazon all those companies during the greatest bull run of all time had periods where they traded flat or down for six months or a year or more but your trying to tell me during a bear Market when we had the highest inflation in history the FED raised rates the highest in history and coming off a ridiculous high that was way too high it's unrealistic for a stock to trade down or flat for a period of a year year and a half or so during that kind of a time frame much less during the greatest bull market of all time if that can happen to Apple during the greatest bull market of all time it's not unreasonable or it's out of the ordinary or signals anything different or wrong with PayPal in regards to it trading down during you know basically a bear market during some very unique times in the history of the markets so I agree not everybody likes the stock understand that's,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hyBAMxO6H1M,okay there's the beauty of stock market is there's tons of stocks you can buy there's tons of winners you can buy and we don't need all the same winners there's not going to be five winners or 10 winners or 20 winners there's going to be hundreds of winners maybe even thousands of winners over the long run so we don't all need the right stocks but for me this is the right stock for me and my portfolio all right and on to the final stock here and that would be Airbnb BMB and again I know not everybody likes it I just love the stock I think they're doing great things they continue to get better quarter after quarter after quarter they're coming into their good season here and they were on a nice little run but now they pulled back pretty significantly and that to me if it continues to pull back it's gonna really get into that undervalued territory really undervalued,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
hyBAMxO6H1M,so I've really got my eyes on Airbnb especially if it gets underneath 100 you'll definitely see some big buys from me back into this stock here not that I sold it it kind of sounded like I traded I haven't traded it but I haven't been buying it recently because it's had such a nice run up in the stock price so if it gets back down around that range I absolutely will be buying again and if you don't know how to do evaluation and have a plan for a stock make sure you check out the market Insider's private group or we teach you exactly that through five courses you get unlimited access to many of my DMs we do live q and A's we got tons of exclusive videos you can watch you get access to the best six and seven figure Discord out there,overall_free_search.csv,1.0

v2bfmAD6YnI, all right guys 3M stock I'm going to tell you something I've started a position in 3M stock NOW first off do not buy 3M stock just because I did you need to do your own homework I've never bought a company just because they've a big investor has ever look at Warren Buffett he's buying Apple I am not touching Apple until much lower prices if I can do that to Warren Buffett you can certainly do it with me I will show you why I bought 3M but again you should not buy it just because I have mode you started positioning I know he did not so look at us mode not start a position I did and the great news is I want people in our community fight me on this reach out to me and tell me why I shouldn't have bought 3M tell me Paul you're wrong and here's why and there are concerns I have about 3M but we'll go through it and we'll understand it but again you're never to buy or sell anything just because I've bought or sold it ever ever ever ever ever you have to think for yourself,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,and we're here to teach you how to fish not to give you fish so let's check out 3M in our software and it's funny because in our community everybody always say Paul we know you have to you know you have to be careful and stuff I'm like listen we take regulation very seriously so whenever we tell you that we bought something you're not to buy it just because we've done that if you do that is a bad decision but do your own research learn how to fish yourself so 3M stock is down quite a bit from its all-time high of 260 in January of 2018 Mo wow this is 3M Mo yeah I mean this it probably everybody that's watching this somewhere in your room you probably have a 3M product 100 you make the weirdest stuff we have two of them right there look at the Post-its right there it says bull versus bear and Pitch those are three those are three M two everything is there's so much 3M everywhere yeah,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,and they're so a couple here's the first thing I don't like about 3M five billion dollar market cap and look at this Enterprise Value the difference here is the debt it's a big difference however however I will say this Mo there are long-term debt to free cash flow is only 3.8 oh so they're long-term debt of this debt is only like 16 billion dollars and you go to the balance sheet we can scroll all the way to the bottom and see total long-term liabilities uh 21 billion okay so it's 3.8 times there you go okay so it's still a lot of debt but it's a big company with very consistent look at this look at this Mo five year profit margin of 16.4 one year of 16.3 do they consistently make money yep six point one percent dividends what I was looking at right now it eats up a big chunk of their free cash flow but guys how is 3M going to grow yeah like can you make another Post-It note please maybe Wild colors,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,well I'm sure they already have that they beat me to it look at this Enterprise Value to earnings 15 times I mean that's incredible return on Equity 37 return a message Capital 14. so guys the great thing about this is when 3M does find an area they can invest a lot in they do it yeah and they don't and they get a high return of their money but in the meantime if they don't have that guess what they're doing they're paying out in dividends that's what we want to see so they're paying I'm okay with dividends if they have no other use of the money because I don't want them wasting their money wasting my money as a shareholder on making bad Acquisitions and other Investments buying back shares too they're buying back shares ten years ago they had 675 million average diluted shares outstanding now it's 553 yeah,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,they're buying back stock at 11 times the trailing 12-month earnings right now they're at 10pe buy the crap and as the shares go down in price keep buying back more shares I'll buy I could I want to buy some more too I'm gonna buy more shares now guys my guess is this stock will be a lot cheaper at some point in the future why because I think the Market's just really overpriced if you're in our community here if you subscribe to our channel for only a dollar a day you get the software and every day I put my stock market to GDP ratio in there and we're still according to history going back to 1929 70 overvalued so my guess is that a company like this will probably go down will it hopefully go down less because the PE is already low of 10 and the dividend yield is high yeah I hope so,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,but dividend yield being a six percent is that stable well look at this free cash flow last year it dropped from their five-year average from five and a half billion down to four and their dividends eat up 3.3 billion of that so how do you buy back shares and pay that dividend and do all those things right that's very difficult to do so maybe the dividend will stick around maybe they'll cut it even they cut it in half I'm happy with a three percent dividend yield as long as they're buying back hell guys if the if the stock fell in half today I would tell them cut your dividend and just buy back tons of shares because this is not taxable and what's the the stock buyback rate one percent yeah that's stupid thing yeah all,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,right let's look at their cash flow in the last five years and see why there was a big change in the last year I mean look at this consistent cash flow guys I know four point three five five five four five seven five six seven five four very consistent the last decade has been consistent with the exception of a covered bump I mean guys this is like to me this is why I'm liking this let's go to our eight pillars two x's usually the two x's are these two PE and price of free cash flow free cash flows down fine and net income is down fine it's a very consistent company and the revenue growth is not going to be big not going to be big at all let's look at the revenue growth I mean they've been stuck at 30 billion for the last 10 years might even start shrinking maybe so so let's do our stock analyzer tool Mo yeah if I told you 3M was gone in 20 years would you be surprised yes yeah I'd be absolutely shocked,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,yes I'm gonna do a 20-year analysis Mo do you mind doing a 10-year analysis actually why you do a five year analysis let's do it a little bit different all right so we're gonna do a five and ten and twenty year analysis and the reason being is I want to buy companies I want to own for a long period of time and,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,if if 3M Falls 50 but my thesis is still the same I want to buy back more shares to make even more money in 20 years if you can't do that you should not be buying individual stocks you absolutely should just stick to ETFs but if you want to get in the individual stock game the stock analyzer tool has changed the game for people in our community 1.3 million times it was used last year it doesn't include the balance sheet but it gives you a value of the business based on the future projections of your earnings and free cash flow let me show how it goes first line Revenue growth guys look at this Revenue growth it's absolute crap so let's be a little let's be a little conservative let's call it negative one percent over the next 20 years let's call it 2.5 and let's call it actually let's go to and then five percent Revenue growth so I did a low middle and high I did negative one percent two and then five percent profit margin it's the same I'm just going to keep it the same all across the board,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,so I just shook my head I was like how do I change this free cash flow I'm actually gonna do the exact same thing again it's very consistent it's a consistent business now think about it now for PE though this doesn't mean I'm doing very I'm doing this different than I did the last 3M video I'm assuming negative growth I need to make my money through an earnings multiple so I'm gonna go eight I'm gonna go ten 14 and 18 p e and price of free cash flow because I think their brand name if they're able to get back to decent Revenue growth should sell for a premium to the market because it's a high moat business look at this 10-year roic 16 and a half percent this is a sign of a moat that they can get they can get and maintain a high return on invested capital all right that's the big key now for my desired return guys I've made some really low assumptions here so I don't need as big a return and I've made some pretty high assumptions here,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,so I need a bigger return and the bigger return you want is the higher margin of safety right Mo so mo why don't you tell me what you want to do with these desire returns I put in 10 11 and 12 but my spread was very different from yours so if I was you I'd go a little bit higher I'm doing 10 11 and a half and 13 okay all right because on the low side even though the market can do 10 I'm buying up but I think because it'll be a top quality business better than the market better than the overall average in the market and I'm okay making 10 on that one yeah so I'm at the analyze button Mo hit it too yep low price 89 high price 140 middle price 109. it's clearly my watch list at 95 bucks because I want to notify me again so I can start selling more puts on the company what'd you get mine's 81 to 116 Middle Ground about a hundred okay so you're basically there too and and I I didn't have a lot of fluctuation in my numbers,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
v2bfmAD6YnI,so I don't really see them declining in three percent Revenue over the next five years like I think negative one I can see all of these situations being reasonable yeah and I look at this thing a lot yeah I look at this saying guys at some point this company's got to get into paying down debt and buying back even more shares especially as the stock goes lower so guys again don't buy this company just because I did that's good it's going to end up costing you in the long run but sit there and learn a process when you learn the process you will become more free you'll feel better about yourself check out everythingmoney.com is a way to start one dollar per day for seven days check it out it'll change the way in which you look at money,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
1ei6Mv34CmA, today we're talking about six cryptocurrencies that I think are going to do very well going forward and I personally hold these coins in my portfolio I believe that these coins are going to help me build my multi-million dollar portfolio going into the next Bull Run and that's something that I just wanted to share with you guys with that said nothing in this video or any of my other videos is an endorsement for you to go out and buy crypto,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,right you guys have to do your own research I am simply telling you what I am doing in this market with that said on top of it I am not a financial advisor I'm just a guy sitting in a hotel room talking about cryptos that I'm particularly excited about let's jump straight into this video briefly touching on the reasons why I think that the crypto markets are gonna do pretty well going forward first of all we have a lot of talk around the town the crypto town that people are bracing for impact the market could see an explosion if China lifts its ban on crypto now right now from my understanding this is pure speculation,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,but I would say this is probably going to happen as we see the Western countries England Australia earlier and America all turning a blind eye towards crypto having too much of a harsh standpoint on it just a few days ago we saw Australia stop people from being able to on and off board from binance using a bank transfer which is absolutely ridiculous in my eyes I think these Western countries are going to get left behind because crypto in my opinion is similar to the internet that we saw many moons ago and I think it's ridiculous they're not trying to keep up with the rest of the world and countries like China the Middle East and a number of other countries out there I believe are going to see the potential in this space and are going to actually look more favorably towards this Market going forward and these sorts of things could be the start of the next Bull Run if they happen now like I've said on this channel many times I don't believe that we're currently in a bull run we may be just starting out or we may have some other legs,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,downwards,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,so anything I'm talking about in this video has the potential to drop significantly if not go to zero we are also talking about some meme coins in today's video which of course hold the most amount of risk but they have a much higher risk to reward ratio with that said guys there are also other issues in the market like the debt ceiling which may be hit very soon in the next few days which could spell disaster in the short term for the overall market and we do still see a massive correlation between the S&P500 and Bitcoin itself and as you know Bitcoin tends to dictate what the rest of the Market's going to do with that said we do see meme coins basically decoupled from the market over the last couple of weeks which has seen some incredible absolutely wild gains we've captured a lot of those both here on the Channel with multiple 10 to 100 x's and also in my private group so if you do want to come over and join that private group there's a link down there in my description it's an awesome Community you get to see my trades my portfolios and you have other like-minded people doing exactly the same thing and it doesn't matter whether or not you're a beginner or you're Advanced there is something for everyone in that group,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,so if you don't like it within the first three days you can simply drop me or the team a DM and we will give you a full refund no questions asked now with that said let's jump into all right first of all of course Bitcoin and ethereum are my number one place right those are the biggest positions in my portfolio I continually dollar cost average and add the profit that I make for example from meme coins into these two coins meme coin specifically into ethereum other plays like Leverage positions that sort of stuff into Bitcoin I am continually growing these positions and I would just make this video solely about Bitcoin and ethereum but I know that's going to piss a lot of people off so I'm not going to do that today but always those are my biggest positions that won't change when the ball run comes believe you me,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,I'm taking profits from everything with that said let's move on to our first coin today and that is tenant now this was a pre-sale over on Dao maker down maker is one of the best launch pads out there some of the returns that they've had is absolutely incredible and I don't think tenant is going to be any different now this is a very interesting project a large scale project here tenant implements a diverse proof of stake restake your staked assets to validate of smart contract Networks cured by an omni chain governance and we can see down here that the tenant ecosystem comprises of a stable coin a decentralized exchange native gauges a lending Market Ava which is a multi-chain AI powered web3 wallet that is the gateway to crypto for non-technical people around the world and there will also be third-party applications they have huge advisors like Josh who leads product at anchor which is another huge decentralized infrastructure protocol and you guys can go check that out for yourself we've spoken about anchor here on the channel before that's made awesome gains as well and we do have other advisors here and there is a huge roadmap that is taking place as we speak of course the project did just go live on seven different exchanges just a few days ago I was part of this pre-sale now of course like I said you have to go out and look into this,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,but they have just under a hundred and eighty thousand followers right now launched on seven of the biggest exchanges out there and they have some huge Partnerships happening in this space as we can see from the price action there was a violent move of when this project was leased onto the market and what we've seen is actually a very nice sideways action from then on out there hasn't been any huge dump downwards which is good this is the kind of movements that we want to see here yes for some reason this isn't showing the actual all-time high but it did of course go higher than this that's a completely normal thing that we see on the launch day of a project and like I say all the time on this channel if you are trying to get involved in a newly launched project it's always best to sit on the sidelines and wait for a better opportunity rather than chasing that initial pump and right now we are seeing this sideways action which could result in explosive move upwards if the market stays bullish of course we've spoken about the things that may happen like the debt ceiling which could have a negative effect on the market so please do keep that in mind if you do want to learn more about tenant you can get over the coin market cap and over here you have all of the links to their website the Twitter and everything else that you need to know about this project again guys I am holding tenant myself so of course take that information as you will and let's move on to the next project now this is moonwell moonwell has an absolutely tiny market cap at 1.6 million circulating,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,right they also have a larger market cap of fully diluted which is 25 million just under so there is a very small amount of this Project's token out on the market which could mean that there are further unlocks which push this price even lower,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,but I do believe that this shows some potential as a moon bag for me the project is another lending protocol built on moonwell at the moment but what they are planning to do is launch on base which is coinbase's new ecosystem that they are launching coming relatively soon now again we have advisors for this project Justin Lee is former coinbase inventures we got Alex from Dapper labs tokensoft and Ledger we got again Elias here from coinbase and someone else from Sushi swap so huge investors and investments from coinbase Ventures coinbase Ventures invested into this project at a higher valuation than it is right now this gives me an idea I'm just speculating and guessing best Ventures invested moonwell planned to launch on base which is obviously coinbase's project this is all pushing towards a narrative where coinbase has a lot to do with this project which could result in the future of a listing potentially on coinbase now I have absolutely no idea if that's going to happen there's a high probability that it will not happen but I'm willing to put a small amount of my investments into this project slowly dollar cost averaging because I believe there is huge upside potential again I don't know,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,but today I did decide to buy some moonwell dollar cost averaging into my bag I am down from my initial investment and by dollar cost averaging at this price I bring down my overall cost basis which is something that I want to do with projects that I intend to hold for the long term now moving on from moonwell we have xtp another project that I am down on since I started slowly investing into this if you have been following my channel for a while you know my investment strategy for my long-term portfolio is simple DCA as the price falls down I can dollar cost average into the project bringing my cost basis down down meaning the second there is a bounce I'll be in profit much quicker than if I had just put all of my investment right in at the very start,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,so that's what I personally do xtp currently sit just under a 40 million dollar market cap for fully diluted and just under 5 million for the circulating market cap now tap is of course an exchange token it's the governance token for their exchange and they are fully regulated and licensed which is something that I want to see and they do have 13 000 followers over on Twitter fully regulated in Gibraltar and their app is to seamlessly send receiver and manage your money and crypto all in one place now the reason why I want exposure to this is we've seen so many times exchange tokens do extremely well don't get me wrong we sometimes see exchange tokens do absolutely terribly like FTX going to pretty much zero those are possibilities we don't know if that's gonna happen for xtp or not I'm putting a little bit of money into it because I see potential upside and of course we've seen this a number of times on the channel BNB coin bit gets coin and a bunch of other exchange tokens all have done very very well in this space so I believe that if we do head into another bull market xtp can see some price action going upwards but of course it all revolves around the overall market and whether or not we can push out of this little bear Market space that we're in I of course also dollar cost averaged into this today with my own personal funds now moving on to another exchange this time it's a decentralized exchange it's Vella this is a decentralized Perpetual exchange so you can trade Futures using your metamask or your non-custodial wallet I believe that this is going to do,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,very well we see GMX which is really the leader in this space at around a 500 million dollar market cap and this is during a bear market so I believe that GMX can go much higher from where it is today and in turn I believe that Vela can also do the same I think that vela's user interface is great,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,I think the product is great right now they haven't launched the mainnet they were in beta and when they were in beta there was an opportunity to create volume on The Exchange in order to get yourself an airdrop and that's something that I did and brought to you guys here on the channel I also hope develop in my personal portfolio and our dollar cost averaged into it today because I believe that there is still upside potential for this in and around maybe a 10x in this space no one really knows how far the next Bull Run can go but again slowly dollar cost averaging for the long term when we're in a space like this which is exactly what helped me in the last bear Market to grab some awesome prices for projects for example cardano was one of the biggest returns that I made in the bear Market from Simply paying attention and dollar cost averaging now with that said let's talk a little bit quickly about the meme coins and some opportunities in this space Pepe today is up 4.36 and for me this Sparks a little bit of interest because this may mean that the meme coins can go on another run if Pepe does continue to show strength I do believe that Pepe acts as the Bitcoin for the meme market right now in this season that we're in so the way Bitcoin if it moves up we nearly always see other coins like ethereum follow it now we're seeing the same thing with Pepe if Pepe moves down we see the meme coin Market move down,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,Pepe moved sideways we see the meme coins go sideways Pepe moves up we then start to see meme coins go up again so there are two that I want to bring up today one of which I did bring up in my private group This Is MeMe Dao today they sit at a 1.6 million dollar market cap and basically what they are is a meme coin facilitator and they plan to hold buy and distribute meme coins amongst the holders of meme Dao so basically holding this coin will give you access to other meme coins that the community decides to buy and distribute amongst the holders of course this is a meme coin it's super risky we don't know what's gonna happen we can check out the shorter term price action here you can see like a lot of meme coins it did have a very nice initial pump here pushing down to find some support Here,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,and Now what I think is good to see is a slow push upwards a steady growth upwards which could show some potential going forward so definitely go out and check out this coin again I personally hold this in my portfolio and then moving on to another coin that I have spoken about here on the channel before it's magic Sheba starter now this launched very recently right now sitting at a fully diluted market cap of 1.2 million and the circulating market cap is extremely low right now at 150 000,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,so there is a lot of room for this still to grow you can see a very similar chart here an initial pump downwards finding some support and then heading upwards here something that I like to see essentially what magic Sheba starter are doing is becoming a launch pad on shiberium once aberian goes live they will Bridge the tokens from ethereum which they're currently on over to shiberium and then they'll start to incubate and launch projects directly here and then by holding the coins you get access to different tiers in the launch pad now in the last Bull Run we saw massive returns being involved in launch pads and I do believe that this still shows some opportunity going into the next Bull Run no guarantees especially this is a launch pad mixed with meme coins all right so there's no guarantees here very high risk High reward potential of Investments going to absolute zero,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
1ei6Mv34CmA,but I personally know that I'm still currently holding this in my portfolio as we speak and with that said guys like all of the coins and projects and ecosystems and anything that I hold in my portfolio I plan to take profits all right I'm not one of those influencers who comes out and tells you that I have Diamond hands and I would never sell anything and then later on a couple of months later someone finds out that I've been selling I do take profits so when I get into something early and the price moves up I take profits from it that's how I believe we make money in this market I don't believe in having a hundred percent of my assets in crypto I don't believe in Diamond hands I don't believe in any of that I believe in trying to make as much profit as I possibly can so I can diversify yes into other cryptocurrency projects but also into stocks and shares and of course the property market,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

PTxWrXSFK7M,Ada could surpass Bitcoin could surpass ethereum could surpass all other cryptocurrencies this summer thanks to a series of updates and proposals set to be released in the coming weeks one of the most significant updates is the CIP 1694 proposal which aims to revolutionize cardano's on-chain governance infrastructure and turn the network into a truly decentralized gov government The Proposal is set to be integrated in the upcoming Voltaire update and will allow any user to submit a governance action hoskinson also talked about cardano's ongoing effort to measure and quantify decentralization using metrics such as the genie and Nakamoto coefficients these metrics would provide valuable insights into cardano's level of decentralization basically what Charles is saying is that cardano is one of the few crypto projects which has always geared itself towards decentralization bitcoin's decentralized ethereum's decentralized institutions realize that that Bitcoin and ethereum are Commodities there are a lot of crypto currencies that aren't it's not necessarily clear that they're Commodities but after cardano's updates it's going to hit a level of decentralization and could be adopted by Major regulatory bodies worldwide because of it by using these indicators to assess these centralization policy makers could formulate informed regulation and differentiate between cryptocurrencies as either Commodities or protocols based on their decentralization Avalanche doing big things you might not even realize this Avalanche adds native Euro stablecoin Ava Cloud Avalanche is making moves to attract developers and defy liquidity with its latest feature rollout so what exactly is going on with Avalanche why are Avalanche holders excited well developers on layer 1 Avalanche this week launched what they're calling,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
PTxWrXSFK7M,Ava Cloud,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
PTxWrXSFK7M,Ava cloud is built as a launch pad for deploying and scaling no code fully managed custom blockchains which Avalanche calls subnets subnets are analogous to Cosmos consumer chains which are connected to the cosmos hub using replicated Securities but speaking more on Ava Cloud specifically the product Suite comprises an interoperable blockchain Builder with managed validators and Analytics tools it is aimed at businesses that want to launch blockchains quickly with minimal overhead costs currently Avalanche touts the in-game shrapnel and Korea marketing platform SK Planet among its early developers and as I said with Ava Cloud Avalanche has launched a Euro stable coin coincidentally circled the issuer of the second largest stable coin on ethereum usdc actually multi-chain announced that its eurobact token Euro c is now natively available on the Avalanche C chain making its first foray into multi-chain expansion as I hinted at awesome to see this is a crypto protocol that many have forgotten about but on certain metrics they've never been doing better active subgraphs on the graph's mainnet of 26 percent quarter over quarter over the past five quarters the number of subgraphs launched on the graph protocol's mainnet has grown steadily at the end of q1 there were 776 active subgrats on the mainnet up to 26 percent quarter after quarter I like it do not count out ethereum this is an interesting metric there is no eth to trade well ethereum exchange balance drops to a five-year low the eth balance decline began September 2022 dropping significantly in November and December after the downfall of FTX people removing their coins from exchanges this is that five-year low five years back it was above this level interesting to see ethereum getting taken off exchanges like this and of course this probably has a lot to do with where ethereum is today compared to five years ago staked ethereum deposits just hit a new all-time high of 22.2 million do you stake your ethereum Aptos making big moves NBC Universal and Aptos Labs team up on a web 3 game for Nicholas Cage's Renfield Aptos Labs has partnered with NBC Universal to create a web 3 game to promote the upcoming film remfield featuring Nicholas Cage as Dracula I saw this film I liked this film it was a great summer comedy players can win digital Collectibles within this game minted on the Aptos blockchain by identifying hidden bugs in these stylized photos Aptos Labs is a layer 1 blockchain secured by proof of stake with a market cap of 2.35 billion and Partnerships with Google cloud and moonpay this next project we've never talked about it on the channel before I think it's relatively new I'm bringing it to your attention because Joe Rogan is bullish on this crypto project specifically it's kind of a way to bet on MMA fights but the players also get rewarded I need to dive deeper into this this may be one of the first signs of early adoption of web3 I do know karate combat has an interest in gaming but this is massive for sports too let's highlight it karate combat this is what Joe Rogan has to say on Karate combat it's great,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
PTxWrXSFK7M,so they listen to the fans they get 10 of the fighters and if a lot of people are betting that could be really good for the fighters as well to get a little bit of extra dough I really like the idea of a token that's attached to an organization that makes me excited about crypto tokens because look at this okay all new Karate Combat app is now live so that's a great idea it's a great idea also that it goes to the fighters as well ten percent if the UFC implemented something like that I think that would be very successful I think it's a very very good idea I think so too probably one of the most unique ideas that I've heard in a long time and an implementation of crypto token that I think is fantastic uniswap still the leading decentralized exchange out there making new all-time highs in monthly active users uniswap monthly active users about to hit 1 million eth layer 2 polygon is changing the game in many ways Reddit seems to be one of the only platforms that cracked the code for nft adoption on ethereum are specifically on polygon Reddit the only big Tech firm that cracked the nft code polygon co-founder says polygon co-founder applauds Reddit success and onboarding millions of users to crypto during a wide-ranging discussion this was during an AMA session on Reddit no doubt polygon's co-founder said the social media giant cracked the code for nft adoption besides sharing pro-crypto and polygon views like how web3 will complement web 2 in areas like Finance gaming social media the founder also explained how Reddit managed to win over its Community with the launch of its digital Collectibles the social media platform introduced nfts they didn't call them nfts they called them collectible avatars on polygon July 2022 smack dab in the middle of a bear market via airdrops and early sales of digital Collectibles for up to 100 the early nfts went on to sell for hundreds of dollars on the secondary Market overall Reddit was just able to drive tons of Engagement with Reddit nfts perhaps because nfts went out to specific communities already established subreddits within reddit reddit was responsible for adding 3 million crypto users in the first three months following its nft launch over the last 10 months the company has successfully onboarded 9.7 million users to reddit's nft platform and this is all happening on polygon polygon represents a multi-chain ecosystem of side chains that leverage ethereum security to provide a scalable application platform currently it supports two public blockchains polygon and polygon ZK evm speaking of targeting specific communities decentraland targeting Pride community in a positive way obviously decentraland metaverse Pride event aims to Spur real change one Avatar at a time three-day metaverse Pride 2023 celebration will offer educational experiences and live music performances with a focus on the community decentraland throwing a gay Festival in the metaverse very cool that's it my friends subscribe to this channel for daily videos keeping you informed on the entire crypto market like the video your support means the world,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

qQJOPiEZO_k, here are the cryptocurrencies I'm buying this month the first is ethereum did 14 000 X from its lows and pulse chain has already done more transaction volume than Solana and Avalanche and it was even beating binance chain at one point last week and at more than 14 000 X that means one PLS token would reach over 10 cents if not more the second is the Smashing of the like button all coin I'm just kidding but thanks for your support the second is heck since the ethereum hex and now hex on pulse chain have split it has caused Mass confusion and Chaos between holders hex still offers trustless yield of 38 apy if you should take for the maximum Lane and I think hex could reach a dollar if not more on both chains in the next Bull Run and the third is xrp rumor has it the lawsuit is ending in the next few weeks to month and I think xrp could pump as high as five dollars if not more if they win the lawsuit like involvermore,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
0ZMy96xYkh8, the top 5 best crypto to buy right now these cryptos can make you Millions right now Bitcoin ethereum and other top tokens of the crypto Market are moving sight words but all coins are pumping with multiple mean coins up over one thousand percent in just two weeks and various other low market cap all coins spiking in price this might not be a great time to buy Bitcoin but altcoin prices are still low and it is a really good time to pick up lower market cap all coins before it's too late that's why in today's video we present you five well-established projects which we have been buying this week in the crypto Market rebound we have included a range of low risk to high risk Investments with number five being by far the most lucrative in our opinion so make sure you stay until the end of the video to see what the best crypto to buy right now is also just before we go any further this channel has a daily giveaway of 1 million Sheba tokens to enter all you have to do is be subscribed to this channel like this video and comment,overall_free_search.csv,1.0

0ZMy96xYkh8,Shiba Inu good luck also guys please beware of scammers in the comments I will never ask you to send me money and I do not have WhatsApp or Telegram and of course this content is not Financial advice anyway let's not waste any more time and get into it now the first token of the video although is not our number one pick I still feel it is an amazing project that you can't miss out on number one hetera currently hedora is priced at around 5 cents with a market cap of just over 1.7 billion dollars what is hetera in simple terms hbar is a digital currency used to power transactions and operations within the hedora hashgraph ecosystem which focuses on offering an alternative to blockchain technology for creating fast secure and scalable decentralized Solutions why do I think hetera's price will explode unlike traditional blockchain platforms hetera hashgraph uses a unique consensus algorithm called hashgraph which aims to provide high throughput low latency and strong security but the main reason that I believe h-bar's price will explode is because it is ISO 222 compliant for those that don't know the iso 222 standard is the new protocol being adopted by the international financial industry due to h-bar's Advanced and patented technology it sticks out in the crypto market and could be one of the best cryptocurrencies for financial services hetera's price targets and predictions hbar has previously hit all-time highs of 56 cents but the crypto had a lower Supply so the market calf didn't need to be as high but now there is a bigger supply the token will need a higher market cap to get to 56 cents but h-bar is a great cryptocurrency and I believe it will get to a 10 billion dollar market cap this would give the crypto a price of 31 cents using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around two thousand dollars in profit if the token was to hit just 31 cents number two Quant ly is priced at around 112 dollars with a market cap of 1.6 billion dollars the token is currently down 73 from its all-time highs what is Quant Quant is a cryptocurrency that powers the Quant Network which focuses on connecting and integrating disparate blockchain networks and traditional systems to facilitate efficient and secure communication and data Exchange why do I think quants price will explode Quant Network aims to address the critical issue of interoperability in the blockchain space enabling seamless communication between different blockchains and Legacy systems which is a much needed functionality for widespread adoption not only this but similar to h-bar Quant is also ISO 222 compliant meaning the chance of major adoption within Financial Services is highly likely quant's price targets and predictions I think it's fair to say Quant could have a similar market cap to hbar so we will say it could reach a market cap of 10 billion dollars this would give the crypto a price of 685 dollars using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around two thousand five hundred fifty dollars in profit if the token was to hit 685 number three Aptos currently Aptos is priced at around 9.59 with a market cap of over 1.8 billion dollars what is Aptos Aptos is a layer one blockchain focused on scalability safety reliability and upgradability as its key principles it is designed to run a variety of decentralized applications and non-fungible tokens and users can be reassured of a secure key recovery system why do I think Aptos price will explode my main reason for believing apto's price will explode is that the project has a strong partnership with Google Aptos also just recently announced another new collaboration with Google which will provide startups with the support and resources needed to develop infrastructure Bridge platforms and Foster the future of web3 Aptos price targets and predictions earlier this year Aptos hit all-time highs of 19.92 but the market cap was only 2.9 billion dollars I could see Aptos hitting a market cap of 15 billion dollars giving it a price of 78 dollars using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around three thousand five hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit just 78 number four injective currently injective is priced at around seven dollars and 48 cents with a market cap of 597 million dollars what is injective injective protocol is a decentralized exchange that offers cross-chain margin trading derivatives and forks Futures Trading the injective protocol is built on the cosmos blockchain as a layer 2 application the protocol uses cross-chain Bridges which allow traders to access cryptocurrencies from platforms such as ethereum and polkadot why do I think injectives price will explode unlike other popular decentralized exchanges such as uniswap or Banker injective protocol does not use an automated Market maker formula to manage liquidity instead injective follows the order book model that has been widely used for years across a centralized stock and crypto exchanges in doing so injective aims to match the efficiency of traditional Finance with the transparency of decentralized exchanges injective has also been making lots of positive developments throughout the bear market and has recently started integrating with multiple other blockchains injective price targets and predictions I believe that injective could reach a 10 billion dollar market cap which would give it a price of 125 dollars using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around seven thousand eight hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit just dollars now time for the final token of today's video this one is currently at a very low market cap valuation and has the potential to make you millions of dollars in profit so drop a like on the video to support me for finding this gem number five wojak currently wajac is priced at around 0.0004 dollars with a market cap of 31 million dollars watch Act is a meme coin and is extra volatile so take Extra Care investing in this project it is also down 17 for today but it could definitely still bounce back soon what is wajac wojak is a mean coin based on the famous internet logic character why do I think wajac's price will explode at the end of the day it is a meme coin and the reasons it could explode are mainly due to buying volume and popularity I believe the people who missed on initially buying into Pepe will buy into wajac and when the token is listed on more exchanges it will sustain more buying volume 's price targets and predictions I believe that if wajac's price pumps it could reach similar market caps to the Pepe coin Pepe hit a market cap high of 585 million dollars if one Jack Hits the same it would have a price of 0.008 dollars using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around eight thousand eight hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit zero point zero zero eight dollars but these aren't the only tokens you should be buying up at the moment if you want to find out the five best AI cryptos to buy now then check out the video on screen now trust me you don't want to miss

qSuiXSAYUsQ, hi everyone welcome back this has to be one of the best asset classes out there that I like and yes the equities Market is sleeping right now it's just kind of enjoying the weekend but you know what never sleeps crypto it's always running it's always doing something sometimes it's a trip and fall but it has gotten up every single time will this be the same thing or are we in the the crypto winner that has years and years to go we'll go over that as well as we'll take a look at some of the price predictions for some of these coins out there and tell you where it's going to go but right now this is my best crypto to buy now the list of course we'll go over the ethereum price prediction the Bitcoin price prediction I've done some videos on it,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,but it's been a while now before we get into it of course make sure you take advantage of the MooMoo link down below put 100 in using my link you get 10 free stocks worth up to 2 000 a piece then of course if you go over to the Weeble link down below any deposit a dollar or more and you will get up to 12 stocks worth up to thirty thousand six under and friends I am going to be buying stocks and of course crypto if you'd like to join us along with that all you got to do is come on over to the patreon link down below sign up you can join up you can see all the different posts everything else we got going on there and of course follow along with the buy sells and be a part of that Discord that's what it's about now we gotta talk about this where is crypto been where are we gone is it over is the winner over of course I thought we already had the low for ethereum was it I've said this before I thought the crypto winner was over for ethereum when we hit that 800 and something that to me was the ultimate low and from there on out we will not get back down below the 800 now I could be wrong maybe a major recession out there could cause something like that,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,but I don't think it will be the major oh my it's a repeat of the Great Recession of 2008 I don't think we're there I do think we'll see some pain and that includes any riskier asset classes such as Crypt though but is there room for crypto to explode over the next two to three years I think the answer to that is yes so much so that I've been putting a lot of money into ethereum building up my position have it staked enjoying the returns and we'll see where it goes but the first we got to go when we're talking about the best cryptos to buy now you can't you got the big dog on the porch it has yet to be dethroned how can you come out here and say well why are you adding Bitcoin listen bitcoin's the big dog he's up there he doesn't have to howl they howl at him all right here we got uh 27 000 right now over the last week of 0.55 so this is kind of the,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,and we're going to look at the week and the month for each one of these down 4.16 for the month for the week up 0.55 percent less than the s p the s p was up more than this so I think it was like 1.8 or nine so we look at Bitcoin and I still think the energy usage is gonna come back to bite this thing in the in the butt someday and we could could see a change down the road like we did with ethereum I definitely think that so 0.55 so we'll just throw it out there you guys know I I'm not into Bitcoin I am into this this ethereum is my favorite when we look at the cryptos the best cryptos to buy now to me there is no other that beats this one could you make a little bit more with some of the others maybe but you're rolling the dice,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,and I think the odds are against you picking the right one personally I think ethereum is where it's at others would say that bitcoin's where it's at my ethereum price prediction I think will hit 10 000 sometime before the end of 2025 doesn't mean we're gonna but if things add up right we're not in a recession we're out of that the feds are cutting rates aggressively put all that together after the having of Bitcoin it usually starts in this next Bull cycle so I would argue with the ethereum being deflationary that we could get to the point that we see this thing close to 20 000 during the next top off of the bull cycle I actually think it could get above there but we'll see because a lot of people are disagreeing but you can see over the last week point nine percent did beat Bitcoin over the last month down six percent did not beat Bitcoin so we're seeing a good week last week but we'll see how it goes going further you guys know this is it that's where I'm putting most of my money I do have some other smaller positions,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,and then we'll start into that the next of the best cryptos to buy now in my portfolio I have cardano in there uh I like the I like cardani you can see over the last week point three one up let's just follow along with ethereum and Bitcoin over the last month down 8.64 so crypto's been struggling last month you see that through Bitcoin you see it through ethereum you see it through Ada,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,I like this for a D5 play that's where a lot of this I would say value could come from as it I always think of some of the old banking services as dinosaurs and crypto is going to be able to do that lightning quick and at a fraction of the cost and so we'll see if that plays out over the next 10 to 20 years but if you're just buying this for a day or two and probably skip this video and this I'm talking about long term I'm talking about possibilities down the road these are the ones I like the next of the best cryptos to buy now Solana over the last week under pressure down 3.17 percent and over the last months a lot of down 8.59 for the month not too bad it's just like the other ones you're seeing them on in the single digits down,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,but I think there's potential I think there's potential like I said we got we got these issue and when I say potential I'm not saying the next week or two because for anybody following my channel and I got a lot more to go over here but for those five on my Channel I want to make make this perfectly clear I believe a recession is coming and it's a haircut to the entire economy including crypto I think crypto could see a hit as we go through this recession but I also believe that crypto is going to be the first to rebound out of that recession that crypto is going to give us the biggest bang for the buck once we get out,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,and I think it's going to happen before we're out of the recession that will start to get that ounce back how bad of a drop I'm not sure it'll probably be very correlated to the overall markets and so if the markets are down 10 I think crypto drops 10 maybe a little bit more usually does go a little bit more down or up but there is last time I was looking it was between 30 and 40 correlation between equities and crypto so we'll find out next of the best cryptos to buy now this is what I want to buy and Avalanche I'm watching I got it on my radar over the last week down 2.14 down 20 percent thankfully I didn't buy it but I still like it and we're gonna I'm keeping an eye on it is this one it's going to pan out I'm not sure I don't have it,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,but we will look and be loading up on this as we go forward not sure we'll see how it goes now uh Mana decentraland the next of the best cryptos to buy now and these are the best this is my best met of cryptos to buy now the metaverse cryptos to buy now I only have two on the list basically it's man and the next one of course over the last week man I got a a lot of love 8.68 might be the biggest I don't remember uh down 17.06 over the last month that tells you even with the eight eight percent up last week that's how bad thing this got hit beforehand you can see I had a little pop up and I was coming back down it's partner in crime here sandbox and this is the other best cryptos to buy now for the metaverse and you can see 5.23 is this the best investment to have is it not the metaverse was getting a lot of love from meta AKA Facebook,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,but now they're cutting back looking into AI instead everybody's following the Hot Topics out there when metaverse was it everybody was jumping in now it's AI so we look at this down uh you can see down 13.98 good week last week but over the last month not so much then we move into the retail Place Dogecoin down are up 2.46 over the last week actually doing well down 12.24 so this last month has been brutal for crypto why do I bring this to your attention because it's all crypto take a look at Shiba Inu the shiba inu you can see down point one three percent for the month down 17.46 so everything's been getting absolutely slaughtered over the last four weeks last week was a little bit of a reprieve but we saw that in the equities too is this temporary or is there are we going to see a continuation of this pop-up and lastly Matic we're talking polygon,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,I like this one as well have this in a portfolio last week 2.66 percent over the last month 16.23 we'll show a year for this one of 34.48 through all that madness out there so these are the cryptos I've been watching I got to tell you something I I look at Bitcoin people say do you think it can go up to a hundred thousand your bitcoin price prediction yeah I think I think Bitcoin will eventually break through hit that hundred thousand dollar Mark but here's the thing that puts it up around four times where it's at now I think ethereum gets up over 10 000 which would be about five to six times its current value and I do believe over the next five years I think ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in market cap and be the largest crypto out there in terms of market cap now some of the things we've been waiting on with ethereum as we're waiting for the SEC to go ahead and I'll allow us to put this thing out there in ETF form,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,and we're talking about the physical backing of these Bitcoin and ethereum but right now you're seeing a lot of offerings being pulled I don't know what's going on is a commodity is it security that's the argument that everybody's waiting here from The Regulators of where we're going it's going to play into at the end of the day crypto's not going away after what happened with FTX and some other some other companies out there the platforms we knew that massive regulation was coming because when the when the hedge funds in the the billionaires start to get hit that's when they get their friends down in DC involved and now they're involved and so now we got to sit back and wait see where it goes but post that time frame with the positive things I've talked about especially for ethereum like I said the deflationary pressures you got once uh we get through the having we got some the sharding that'll that's always a good word to use,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
qSuiXSAYUsQ,but once we get that all involved we can get up to 100 000 transactions per second that is in saying how quickly this could go for ethereum this is big stuff so we'll keep an eye on all that and I think the the potential for massive growth for this is big and then from there we got to watch some of these all so some of these alts will probably outperform both Bitcoin and ethereum but at the end of the day it doesn't mean that I'm going to be like Oh I'm going to chase it right now I'm going with the big dogs I should say big dog ethereum I don't got the Bitcoin I think ethereum is worth zapher I'm taking a chance I got 97 percent of my money in ethereum for those that don't know I have well over a hundred ethereum trying to get up to 200 and then I kind of want to sit back and watch I'll probably continue to buy a little bit weekly with my DCA,overall_free_search.csv,1.0

2ZF4_Srw_M8, the meme coin frenzy feels like it might be dialing back a little bit here and we've had it in the last few months we have to remember though that there are so many great top 100 altcoins out there that we oftentimes forget about during these bear markets because we don't see a lot of price action but when we look at these three all coins in particular that I'm going to highlight in this video here's one thing we know about all three of them they have went through the ups and downs they've been through multiple cycles and they're still here they're still stronger than ever so these three all coins that I'm going to highlight in this video in my opinion are three all coins that you can rely on here in the next Bull Run to provide a really nice return of course nothing here is financial advice nothing here is guaranteed we're all investing we're all taking a risk especially here in a new market like crypto,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
2ZF4_Srw_M8,but when we highlight some of these cryptos uh like the three that we're going to mention here there are a few things I look for number one are they in the top 100 right number two do they have strong leadership and number three do they have strong communities all three of these assets have all three of those things that I just highlighted so let's dive into it and I'm not going to show you anything on screen right now I'm just going to talk at you here and uh we're gonna go through each one and I'm going to give you some insight and details as to why I like all three of these number one is cardano now behind Bitcoin and ethereum cardano is a top 10 crypto ranked number seven right now just behind xrp they came out in 2017 they've been in or around the top 10 since then great leadership in Charles hoskinson great Community right surrounding Ada and recently they've had a big D5 boom which I really really love because obviously that's the future here of crypto,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
2ZF4_Srw_M8,but we've seen selling pressure really hit Ada hard went all the way down to 25 cents late last year I was accumulating currently cardano trading right around 37 cents it's heading close to the bottom trend line right now this retest could offer some Market participants like us an opportunity to reaccumulate as we're trading below 40 cents now when we look at some short-term reversals 42 cents 46 cents and 50 cents are the next resistance line but let's talk about where cardano could go in the future right because the all-time high is about a 10x away from here I think we could be looking at a five dollar cardano in the next Bull cycle we were just over three dollars in the previous cycle,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
2ZF4_Srw_M8,so I think cardano's gearing up for that really big move that they have yet to have they've had a ton of upgrades uh here in the last couple years I think it's setting themselves up uh setting themselves up here for a big big move in that next Bull cycle now number two is Solana a lot of people forgot about Solana because Solana was so attached to the whole FTX drama but recently uh you know the founder of ethereum went on record saying that outside of ethereum vitalik buterin said Solana probably provides the most upside and he loves what they're building the bullish sentiment around Solana in the last cycle was insane there were weeks and months where Solana was going up 10 20 30 40 percent and it seemingly was followed by just as much downside when the FTX debacle came to be but don't forget about Solana it's still here they're still developing and they have a ton of money backing it Solana oftentimes gets overlooked since the FTX situation but it's certainly a good one and one to watch uni swap let's talk about uni swap now admittedly I always forget about this I don't invest in it,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
2ZF4_Srw_M8,but I use it every single day and when we look at all coins that we literally use every single day uni swap is up there right with some of the tops ethereum of course is another one now when we look at Uni swap it too had a big big rally back in 2021 and more and more people are going to the defy side more and more people are taking not your keys not your crypto seriously right and they're learning how to use metamask and how to integrate it with uni swap so the native token to the largest decks on ethereum uni swap absolutely love its potential in the next cycle as well so cardano Solana uni swap three all coins that perhaps you should take a very close look at ahead of this next big boom that will have probably sometime next year into 2025.,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
2ZF4_Srw_M8,that's what I've got for you guys appreciate you guys so much let me know what you guys think of course it's not Financial advice just three all coins I want to keep on your radar make sure you guys are you know schooled up and ready to go for that next cycle let me know what you guys think down below we'll see in the next one peace out,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

ke2VVDSSIks,I think a big but also Fair prediction is that the token could reach 5 billion dollars in market cap this would give the token a value of four dollars and 20 cents using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you can make around seven thousand dollars in profit if the token was to hit four dollars twenty cents number two ocean protocol currently ocean is priced at around 33 cents with a market cap of over 144 million dollars ocean is currently down 82 percent from its all-time high of 1.90 what is ocean protocol the ocean protocol is an ecosystem composed of data assets and services where assets are represented by data and algorithms and services are represented by integration processing and persistence mechanisms ocean protocol facilitates Discovery by storing and promoting metadata linking assets and services and provides a licensing framework that has tool sets for pricing I believe ocean could hit a price target of at least three dollars in the right market conditions using the crypto profit calculator from just a five hundred dollar investment at the current price you can make around four thousand dollars in profit if the token was to hit just three dollars number three or I chain currently aurai is priced at around three dollars and 64 cents with a market cap of just 18 million dollars what is Ori Ori chain is a cryptocurrency that powers the origin Network the RHA network is an AI powered Oracle and blockchain ecosystem oracles are systems that feed real world data into blockchains and origin uses AI to provide accurate and secure real-world data for smart contracts on the blockchain the Ori token is used for various purposes within the origin Network including staking governance and pain for services Ori is a great token that could go really high in the right market conditions I think orai could reach a market cap of 250 million dollars giving it a price of around 48.70 using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you can make around three thousand four hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit 48.70 now everyone we are getting into the really strong buys these next two projects have very low market caps and both have the potential to make you a lot of money in the next couple of months number four anus Network currently EOS is priced at around one cent with a market cap of over 17 million dollars what is AOS network is a blockchain based content delivery Network CDN the project aims to create a decentralized platform for streaming audio and video content by leveraging blockchain technology ao's Network intends to reduce the cost of content delivery improve speed and provide a more efficient and user-friendly streaming experience as token is used within the network for various purposes such as rewarding content creators and users and for governance decisions within the as ecosystem EOS is a cool project that offers something different to web3 I think in the right market conditions we could see as hit a market cap of 1 billion dollars this would give the token a price of one dollar and four cents using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around twenty eight thousand three hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit 47 cents now time for the final token of today's video this one is currently at an under 1 million dollar market cap valuation and has the potential to make you millions of dollars in profit so drop a like on the video to support me for finding this gem number five AI write currently AI write is priced at around 0.003 dollars with a market cap of around 888 thousand dollars what is AI right AI write is a cryptocurrency used within the AI right ecosystem which is the world's first complete system for AI nfts and defy users in this system can generate AI nfts protect origin with copyright issuance trade and tokenize unique artworks and benefit from a complete royalty mechanism for contributors on chain origin the ecosystem provider of AI write secures AI functionalities via AI Oracle access is the marketplace organizes galleries for defy and enables cross-chain bridging for nfts the big thing that makes AI write different from other nft marketplaces is that it has AI content authenticity mechanisms to stop copyright infringements one of the biggest issues in nfts is fraud and plagiarism,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
ke2VVDSSIks,AI right solves this now a really big reason why I think this project could reach insanely high valuations is that it has patented technology this means they completely own the rights to this technology and no other project or business can copy them AI write has the potential to soar to multi-billion dollar market caps in the long run but you are so early that if this project reaches even a 100 million dollar market cap then you could get yourself a 100x for this video we will say that it could hit a 150 million dollar market cap,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
ke2VVDSSIks,but I do think in the long run it could reach way higher if it hits a 150 million dollar market cap then it would give the token a value of 50 cents using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around 82 000 in profit if the token was to hit 50 cents but these aren't the only tokens you should be buying up at the moment if you want to find out the top 5 best cryptos to buy now then check out the video on screen now trust me you don't want to miss out on these 100x potential coins,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk, all right look there's something really big happening in crypto right now and I think a lot of people are going to lose lots of money if they don't understand what I'm about to explain now this isn't some charge or technical analysis or whatever you see online this is something that's much much bigger,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,so please I urge you watch this whole video through because I promise you whatever game plan strategy that you guys have right now it'll change after knowing this now this video is going to be a little different from what I usually post instead of just mentioning the coins that you guys should buy which I still will be towards the end of the video I'm first going to mention what's happening in the markets right now because this will ultimately help you even more but before we get into it I just want to quickly mention for those of you that don't know I actually have a newsletter where I send out Daily Business trends that haven't hit the market and how you can be the first to it and make money off of it it's completely free and if you guys want you can sign up by clicking the link down below and as always make sure you guys smash that like button subscribe if you guys haven't already for all your crypto updates and without further Ado let's get into it alright,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,so the stuff I'm going to share with you guys I'm going to be honest I'd even find out for myself until recently so I'm gonna try breaking this down as simple as possible for you so if we look at the price of Bitcoin the all-time high we hit was about 64-65 000 and right now we're sitting at around 16 000.,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,now judging by what everyone else is saying on Twitter and all these other videos I'm pretty sure you're thinking that we're at the bottom and we can't go any lower for bitcoin's price I mean you can tell that just by looking at the chart or just seeing everything that's happened recently with FTX black five Voyager Luna all these liquidations heck even if you were to look at a technical point of view everything indicates that we're at the bottom so realistically we can't go any lower and that's what a lot of people already think I mean even with one of the largest lenders Genesis going under the market barely even moved three percent if if this was any other time period we would have easily saw a 10 to 20 drop but we didn't so in order for us to see the price come down lower substantially we're gonna need to see some crazy stuff happen like like Finance going under or uh usdt getting pulled or something of that nature something large has to happen for the price to come down further than it was already at,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,so like I said everything is pointing out for the market to be at the bottom already and everyone kind of already figures that and if it wasn't for what I'm about to share with you I honestly would be buying all this up in dollar cost averaging in but there's something really big happening that a lot of people are overlooking and I was too onto I watched another video and realized just how big this actually is now to understand this we're gonna need to zoom out instead of just looking at the crypto markets we have to look at the traditional markets as well so stocks equities bonds real estate because everything is all tied together now whether you like it or not now I'm going to explain it just as it was explaining the video because it did a really good job getting the point across so basically think of a big skyscraper and within that skyscraper we have all the markets that I mentioned so stocks bonds Equity Real Estate everything is within the skyscraper and then in the basement all the way at the bottom of the skyscraper we have our little itty bitty crypto market so in our tiny Market in the basement everyone is partying having a good time thinking crypto has finally bottomed out and things are only going to go up from here but what they don't understand is that we have all these other big markets right on top of us so when all these markets end up crashing down what do you think will happen to the price of crypto now we don't know how low we can go but the point is there is a huge possibility of this happening and it could send prices crashing and the reason I know this can happen is because of what I'm about to tell you now what people need to understand is yes we're in a crypto bear Market but this is the first time that we're in a macro bear Market as well meaning all the other Investments are down as well because previously in history every time crypto would be in these beer markets um 2013 2017 2022 these other markets were perfectly fine if anything they were thriving so even though at the time of those crypto bear markets large investors or whales that were in crypto,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,and that saw other portfolios getting crushed they were perfectly fine with it because all their other Investments were doing well now imagine all these other Investments they have which probably make up like 90 of their net worth crash as well what do you think they're gonna do with their crypto we're talking about something that's never happened in history but for people would even know how to react and this is also one of the main reasons why people don't do well in crypto and I was the same way as well you think crypto is its own thing and it was at one point but now there's just so much tied into the crypto market and the one who understands this will end up making a killing also another thing I wanted to mention is this chart now this is the Bitcoin rainbow chart and it shows where we are in the market every time we were in the bear Market it predicted it and it showed the rally afterwards as well now I've seen a lot of people refer to this chart and I myself have used it as well as it's a very popular chart,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,so if you use it I encourage you to stop because everything about it is wrong because amongst the whole chart we've never seen one bad macro environment meaning all the other investments in the world are crashing There's real estate crashing credit debt is skyrocketing layoffs are everywhere home prices are skyrocketing retirement is plummeting we didn't see any of that during this chart so this is a good chart for you know when everything is going well in the world when there's no worries no tension when every other investment is doing great,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,but overall this chart legit doesn't even make sense to use then I'm embarrassed that I've used it before myself because just imagine how this chart will look when every other Market is falling on top of crypto and people have insanely High credit down on top of that they're not being able to afford their house their retirement money is pretty much crashing that that would be insane now if we look at the top of Bitcoin again the reason why we saw such a huge drop in its price from 65 000 was because in November that's when inflation was really starting to pick up and there were talks that the Fed was going to start to raise interest rates and what happens when interest rates increase normal finance and everything else crashes now how does not have this inflation problem that we had back in November would we have past 65 000,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,I really think we would have because there was nothing stopping us at the time so everyone who was buying up here at 65 000 were only focused on the crypto market and weren't taking into account the macro lens and seeing that their rate hikes were coming and because of that they ended up getting crushed so if we look at the bottom of crypto right now which everyone thinks we are in they aren't taking into account that everything else in the skyscraper is going to fall right on top top of us and bring down the price even more now if we look at one more thing this is a chart that shows what happened every time the FED started to raise interest rates and we can see from this chart that when the FED begins to Pivot we can see an even more drop in the market value and what you have to understand is the second interest rates increase the market doesn't just come down right away it can take months to years before we see the outcomes of a rate increase because what will happen is businesses will start to lay off people people will start to spend less money the stock price will start to come down the real estate prices will start to come down and all this is what brings down the market overall and all this takes time to happen and that's what we're seeing happen right now with tech stocks getting hit like crazy layoffs starting to occur in mortgage demand dropping these these are all side effects of increased interest rates so what do I think is going to happen,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,well I honestly feel like the general Finance market so stocks uh equities bonds is most likely going to crash there's just so much going on right now we saw 10 years of legit perfectness and now we're finally starting to see the side effects start to roll in so what does this mean well the price of Bitcoin right now is was about sixteen thousand and this is with all the other markets you know just being average and nothing crazy happening to it but when we start to see the effects of everything and traditional markets start to crash I honestly think Bitcoin will go lower than 16 000. how low will Bitcoin go I honestly have no clue but what I do know is that there is no way that Bitcoin will stay stagnant while all the other markets are crashing that's just impossible and won't happen now there is a slight possibility that we avert all of this and the traditional markets don't take that big of a hit and we don't see the markets crash,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
93EugzZ05Bk,but that's something we just can't predict so that brings us to the question what can we do well we have two outcomes all the markets could crash bringing crypto down with it as well or we could hit a soft bottom and we don't see any crazy crash and we just start picking up straight from there so let's say the markets crash hypothetically if we look back at the chart we can see that every time the FED pivots we see the price always recover eventually so if you buy any time during this time frame you're good now you don't need to time it perfectly but just buy Within These time frames and the thing is you can honestly buy anything and you'll be good because there'll be so much blood in the markets that anything you buy will legit be a good investment that will pay off eventually and you can even just buy the top cryptos and you'll still see some crazy gains I'm talking ethereum cardano BNB Ripple,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
93EugzZ05Bk,but we aren't in that time period not right now so the best course of action right now is to hold off and see what is going to happen with these markets now I know a lot of you guys just love to dollar cost average,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,so if you guys want to continue that go for it but just have enough on the sidelines where if this does happen your fuel is ready to go and if by some miracle we don't see these crashes and we see a massive Boron instead which which is slightly possible then you just go straight into all coins and you just ride the wave up because remember first bitcoin's price will go up and then the all coins price will follow after so once we start to see Bitcoin go then you can start getting into these smaller all coins and make more money that way now crypto has definitely gotten it the worst with all these liquidations and everything else going on in the markets but these other traditional markets are holding pretty well but soon that won't be the case and we're gonna start to see more layoffs start coming in debts start increasing people start to spending less money which was going to cause stocks to plummet as well which will bring down the crypto prices as well but yeah this is the big picture that's happening in the market right now,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
93EugzZ05Bk,and it's honestly a huge thing that I don't see anyone talking about now yes crypto is down right now and everyone is saying that it is the bottom because it looks just like every other bottom we had but you have to remember those bottoms happen when the traditional markets were doing just fine crypto just went down on its own but now we have the chance of this huge skyscraper falling right on top of us but yeah that's all I have for you guys hopefully this opened your eyes to actually what's happening in the markets right now I know this video was a little different from what I usually post but this really needed to be said and if you guys have any insights make sure you guys let me know down in the comment section below also I know a lot of you guys are into trading or want to start trading so I highly suggest you guys looking into Lux I'll go now I talk about them all the time and I just love promoting them because they've helped me so much,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

The crypto market has started rebounding and it looks like we could be entering into this year's bull run, either way, prices are still low and it is a really good time to pick up lower market cap altcoins before it's too late. That’s why in today’s video we present you with 5 well-established projects which we have been buying this week in the crypto market rebound, we have included a range of low-risk to high-risk investments, with number 5 being by far the most lucrative in our opinion, so make sure you stay until the end of the video to see what the best crypto to buy right now is.

7NDH0ntL3go,"Anyway, let’s not waste any more time and get into it. Before we get to the first token I do want to just say that these are mid to long-term buys so don’t get expect to buy these tokens and to see Lambo’s within 24 hours, be ready to hold these tokens for at least 12 months and make sure to aggressively take profits when you can. I also just want to mention that I think dollar cost averaging is a good strategy for all of these tokens. Now the first token of the video, although it is not our number one pick I still feel it is an amazing project that you can’t miss out on. Number 1, Woo Network. Currently, Woo is priced at around 23 cents with a market cap of just over 393 million dollars. What is Woo? Woo Network is a network that helps traders, exchanges, institutions, and Defi platforms connect with each other easily. They can easily trade and get access to the best deals at lower or no cost. The network uses a token called Woo Token that helps users with lower fees and also allows them to earn rewards by holding it.",overall_free_search.csv,1.0
7NDH0ntL3go,"Why do I think Woo’s price will explode? The woo trading platform is very good and it is used by many traders, the platform has proved its reserves and it also has a 24-hour trading volume of around 68 million dollars. I feel like woo is massively underpriced and that the token should be much closer to a 2 billion dollar market cap, it currently has a market cap of 390 million dollars and a fully diluted value of just over 500 million dollars Using basic mathematical calculations, if Woo were to reach a 2 billion dollar market cap it would give the token a price of 1 dollar and 20 cents. Using the crypto profit calculator, from just a 500-dollar investment at the current price you could make around 2000 dollars in profit if the token was to hit just 1 dollar and 20 cents. Number 2, Frax Share. Currently, Frax Share is priced at around 9 dollars and 17 cents, with a market cap of 681 million dollars, the token is currently down 78% from its all-time highs. What is Frax Share?",overall_free_search.csv,1.0

With the vision to create highly scalable, decentralized money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like Bitcoin. Frax Share is the governance token of the entire Frax ecosystem of smart contracts which accrues fees, revenue, and excess collateral value. Make sure not to mix up Frax Share with their stablecoin called frax. Frax could become a major player in the crypto space and I think the token’s price could hit 40 to 60 dollars this year. Using the crypto profit calculator, from just a 500-dollar investment at the current price you could make around 2700 dollars in profit if the token was to hit 60 dollars. Number 3, Nervos Network.

The project’s team has far-reaching plans, which give the crypto investors a lot of faith in the CKB crypto, it has a good community and a great team behind the project.

_iq7vGRXZ4I,but as we move into the first of the best cryptos to buy now of course I always want to have a little bit of the old dog in there airpod is going to set up a brand new portfolio and that's Bitcoin that to me is your your standard and look at this over the last month this coin what are we looking at oh point zero four percent nothing is basically flat so compared to the overall NASDAQ we would have been better off not to be in it now I do want to show you this I'm going to put this in each video each one of these cryptos you can pause read about it and you can go over what these cryptos are about I used to do this when I was a teacher I don't want to waste your time I know you know how to read so you can go ahead and pause the video when I scroll down to that you can read what each one's about now the next one this is my all-time favorite for anybody that knows the top crypto to invest in today in my opinion the number one crypto to buy now is ethereum at least for mine I never tell you what to buy and sell on this channel just what I'm doing I've been loading up on ethereum I have over a hundred ethereum I'm trying to get up to 200 this is what I love I have a steak I'm getting my staking rewards it is dropped though but even over the last month though even though it's dropped from up to the 2000 look where we're at still a 5.44 that's the thing about crypto is you never know where it's gonna go ethereum had the Shanghai update of course that allowed people to unstake their ethereum and that is an ongoing process so as we see that kind of work through the system you're going to see a lot of volatility out there but the good news like I said before look at ethereum up 5.44 compare that to what I just showed you for the NASDAQ we actually Beat It we more than doubled it with ethereum,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,so I'm happy with that it's my number one investment in terms of one position having money this is it ethereum is it it's the big one now Solana I wanted to go into it but before we do I got to make sure I show you this I want everybody to be able to read about it there you go boom boom boom down we go and we're going back over to Solana now now we move into some of these uh altcoins out there that have the potential to become defy uh game Breakers if you will this could be some big stuff and Solana has quite the following but over the last month 2.5 percent compare that to the NASDAQ 2.1 Solana did its thing and is outperformed now we're going to come back and take a look at the year chart but before we do I do want to do the monthly thing so you can see what's going on here and we'll come back up,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,and then we move on to my next one cardano now when we look at cardano I like this thing I think cardano has the opportunity to do some wonderful things and look at the last month it's gotten a lot of love 6.57 of course everything's kind of falling down uh since the middle of April and the question becomes does it continue uh now we had a nice I would say almost flat here going across so we're back down that level I think that's going to be some good support I don't think we're going to go too much further below but you never know if bad things happen the debt crisis in D.C you don't know regulations anything out there,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,but right now I do like cardano now as we look at cardano understand the volatility for all cryptos out there I try to stick to the ones I think really could be game changers and like I said there's a lot of things out there that you can read about you can learn about these definitely pause the video if you don't know anything about the ones I'm mentioning and if you have one in particular you would like me to go over in depth tell you all about it let me know in the comments which one of these that I'm going through is going to be your favorite crypto to add to your portfolio which one of these cryptos are going to be the ones that could explode moving forward to the point that we see 10 20 30 100 times our money let me know down below now the next one Avalanche this is the one I haven't made a major purchase she's on yet I want to I'm still watching it I'm still debating it,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,I like it uh not sure though and like I said I when you look at some of these you have the opportunity to get in at levels that we haven't seen in a while because you say what do you mean Mo well look at this this thing at one time 75 percent down uh it was up over 60 or around there uh in the last year right around 60 in the last year so you see a lot of these prices that we haven't had in a long time and so for people to have it down this low if you're going to be a long-term holder for some of these cryptos you have a chance now one of the best cryptos to buy uh in my opinion Matic it has a rough last month 9.96 but I gotta tell you I still I really really like this one for the long term you can read about it here uh built and it's a scaling solution for the ethereum blockchain has good opportunities and then we move on I know there's a lot of fans when it comes to this top crypto to buy now chain link,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,and if I had to put it in the portfolio like I said I have some of this already you can see my portfolios my crypto portfolios and everything else over at the Discord and on patreon so it's all there I'm buying a bunch of stuff today,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,so it's your opportunity the markets are getting open you're going to be able to see what I'm doing if you want to follow along you want to take it to the next level join the patreon down below I don't know what you're waiting for it's a good thing chain link though as you can see how has not had a good month so far that is also down about 3.44 what you'll notice with a lot of my cryptos that I like very strongly not all of them but very strongly tied to the ethereum blockchain for good reason I'm a if you can't see the Hat guy I'm a big ethereum fan the next one Mana these have been getting beat up the metaverse is not as hot as it was at one time we were hoping to see it explode or you'd like to see the investments in there we didn't get it in the last month down 6.15 for those who are taking what are you talking about you can read about it right here and of course as we move into the next best metaverse crypto to buy now there's two that I like sandbox and man if I had to get into them which I am these are the ones I would consider but I gotta tell you they've been getting beat up 8.37 down,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,and you can read about this one as well here another very uh related to the ethereum block chain an erc20 all right now we move into the best cryptos by now for the what are we talking about with these ones we're talking about the retail place so Dogecoin this is to me I like this one the best I know others out there are Shiba Inu I like this one the best four point three one percent has the uh Elon Musk tied to it you can read about it here I really like this one I I can't remember when it went live for mining but it was back 2013 2014-ish uh I was mining this day one and when I mined this I was getting about 200 000 Doge a day which at one time was worth a hundred and something thousand dollars a day that I didn't even know it was going to get up that high that's when this was 60 something cents a piece so my nightmare story for everyone is that I sold them all back when I got hardly anything for them,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,and then they blew up so I could have been a multi-gazillionaire if I would have kept all my dose coin and not sold them but I did I turned them into Bitcoin and as some people don't know my Bitcoin got stolen but I had it on a on a platform a platform person who uh created it the company and everything else the person who was behind it ended up stealing everyone's crypto and running away now that person's in prison I believe forever uh they caught him finally and I never got my crypto back unfortunately so now uh that's a warning to everyone be careful out there now Shiba Inu there you go and this is the other retail play for those that don't know about Shima Inu you can hear another ethereum based mean point and this has 3.84 percent down so now I gave you a list,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,but I wanted to show you the best cryptos to buy now over the last year how they done because this has been the crypto winner are we out of the winner that's the million dollar question 56 percent down for Shiba Inu Dogecoin over the last year 39 we'll see who's the best and who's the worst uh the metaverse plays I expect to be hammered 78 in decentral land down 71 then we move into uh chain link where 45 down polygon this is Matic down 23 not bad compared to so far I think this is leading the pack and then of course we get into Avalanche 75 down cardano,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,you know I like my D5 plays 55 Solana 78 then we move into ethereum 35 and then of course Bitcoin should be uh the one I would thought would have won not so fast my friend 29.49 which was your winner I believe polygon 23.75 down over the last year and so my question everyone here do you own any of these do you believe they should is there do you believe any of these should be on the list of the best cryptos to buy now or shouldn't be on the list of best cryptos to buy now let me know down below which crypto did I miss that should be on the list put it in the comments let's have some fun talk about about it now where do these things go and I'm going to put it bluntly I believe we're going to have a recession coming up but at and during that recession we'll probably see some selling off of riskier assets including crypto nothing too bad but once we get through that and I think that happens all within 2023 I think we run and we start the next major bull cycle for crypto,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
_iq7vGRXZ4I,and I think that's going to last a few years and we'll see what happens but that's my take on it I'm going to continue the dollar cost average come on over the patreon and see exactly what I'm buying and I do have down below the links to Weeble and moo moos take advantage of them get those free stocks I appreciate you stopping by let's get out there and make some money,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
nie7R29j9f8, all right I've got to talk about this new thing this new news reel that's coming around that trezor has been hacked by unciphered this is old news if you want to know what I'm talking about continue watching before that if you if you guys enjoy these updates I appreciate it if you hit the like button if you're watching anyways and you haven't hit subscribed yet hit subscribe with the Bell notification to get notified when videos like this come out so you can learn more about what's happening in the cryptocurrency space so Ledger just uh made it made huge waves in the cryptocurrency space for all the wrong reasons and they're a major competitor is trezor I do not think it is by accident that now there's all this negativity coming around that trezor isn't actually the end-all be-all hardware wallet either,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
nie7R29j9f8,which by the way I don't think there is an end-all be-all Hardware wallet I think they all have pros and cons trezor is open source and in that uh there was a vulnerability in the hardware of trezor that cannot be updated basically where in this situation basically I talked about this way back in 2019 so this is way old news um and I talked about it actually I mentioned it in a recent video last week as well basically if someone has access physical access to your treasure Hardware wallet for something like 20 minutes or 30 minutes or like a decent chunk of time and they have their specialized computer and they're also very technically Savvy and can do this type of hack to Target your physical treasure device they can hack into your device they can without your seed phrase without your PIN code but um here's what's happening uncipher did this,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
nie7R29j9f8,and now they're saying oh we hacked it we didn't need the seed freeze we didn't need the PID code trezor isn't uh actually a viable option uh outside of Ledger like many people are believing but here's the thing is that number One unciphered never notified treasure that they were attempting to do this so that was done in bad faith in my opinion and not actually in any effort to help trezor improve their security but instead to just be on a fud roll um additionally this is a really important tip you guys under you guys hearing me if you use a passphrase with your treasure this hack cannot happen so for those of you who do have trezor you can create a passphrase which is basically a phrase a word that you create your own which by the way is not perfect either because humans are horrible at creating Randomness,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
nie7R29j9f8,so if you can create a passphrase That Is Random by maybe using something like a dice game you can really be super secure against a physical attack uh that is really in my opinion going to be extremely rare to happen uh in the case of the treasure if you guys are a treasure user or if you're looking to buy one and that one kind of scared you out of it I think it's good to have a whole picture because there's always in the media there's always someone's got an angle and I think that was a little Ledger trash trash campaign for against trezor this is the Classic this has been going on for years by the way anyway if you guys enjoyed this update hit like button hit subscribe we're putting on video every single day so I'll see you tomorrow have a good one,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
#NAME?,so I know many of you may have already heard this news and you're like why are you talking about this Heidi this already happened like that was so last week there's something that people aren't saying that I think is very important to comprehend if you guys want to know what we're talking about hit the like button if you enjoy these videos hit subscribe if you haven't done so yet there's quite a few of you out there that are watching these videos and you're not subscribed maybe you already subscribed when YouTube accidentally unsubscribed to you they do that sometimes so today we're talking about metamask and their terms and conditions uh you know it's funny because no one ever reads the terms and conditions and it you always can tell when someone has red terms and conditions for the first time because they're often shocked at what they're reading and in this time it was misunderstood and so basically metamask is owned by consensus and consensus offers a lot of different products some are able to be bought by you the end user and in their terms and conditions there was some language regarding taxes and they're basically saying if you buy one of our products we're going to charge you tax in your transaction sales tax that's basically what they're talking about but this was severely misunderstood and spread like wildfire across crypto Twitter and Reddit and all those good juicy places for crypto gossip that it was misunderstood that people were thinking that metamask was going to start withholding your taxes if you weren't paying them or if you weren't reporting your cryptocurrency transactions metamask would withhold your crypto until that was all cleared um that's not true they do not do this maybe that will happen in the future and that is the point of this video not fud just raising awareness of we tend to get used to abuse uh in any form of the matter it's really unfortunate that a lot of people make justifications because of convenience or they can put up with it and in this abuse I'm talking about government control and the issuance of I'm going to call them digital currencies not the free market cryptocurrencies that we know and love these are soon to come government issued digital currencies and the fact that so many people were worried that someone could have physical programmable control over their cryptocurrencies if they didn't play by the rules that scared them so much my friends this is a future that is coming um this is not Doom and Gloom,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
#NAME?,I'm just telling you this is a preview so it's something that we should be aware of we should be uh well-versed in how this could play out it might start slow and it might get more constrictive over time uh but I think there's nothing wrong with being aware with something so that you can mentally prepare and have a plan B maybe you plan Bitcoin some might say anyway that's my that's my take on this whole news with metamask I know it's kind of old but it's something that not a lot of people are talking about and it's kind of ironic because it's like the future is staring you right in the face anyway that's my that's my two two satoshi's for today hit like And subscribe I'll see you tomorrow bye guys,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
WF-LddDiUf4, I hate doing videos like this I'm actually really boiling right now uh here's what the CEO of Ledger has to say he explains Ledger recovery would give the state the ability to recover your Bitcoin private keys in the event of a subpoena so what does that mean it means once they are pinched which they will be look at no further than how strict the U.S Canada Australia and so on are getting with crypto okay governments are pinching especially in the EU where you have Mica regulations 180 kyc pretty much everyone and now I'm hearing reports that they want to kyc people that are using decentralized exchanges good luck on that because they're gonna need it if these decentralized exchanges are solid they're not going to be they're they're not going to follow these rules now there's a reason why I'm pissed off too because I didn't actually know that the CEO of Ledger said this in 2020 he said we feel privileged to be speaking with the wef at Davos wow you couldn't speak to a more demonic crowd than at Davos especially the Wes,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
WF-LddDiUf4,so what's happening here it's what's happening is that uh Ledger is trying to make exporting your keys normal it's just trying to normalize this essentially not holding your private keys and and trusting third parties which is which is so crazy that's the whole point of a hardware wallet is to hold on to your private keys and not have to trust anybody let's go on to trust there should be trustless systems we should not even this shouldn't even be a possibility of of happening who care we shouldn't have to care about care about what what happens is third uh three different companies out there that if they get subpoenaed I wouldn't care if this was completely uh if you really owned your private keys this wouldn't matter this should never have been a possibility so what are what is hiding I doing right now well we are on an Endeavor to go and find really good Hardware wallets so more than one there is a lot of different Hardware wallets out there and we are going to find them we are going to do videos on them,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
WF-LddDiUf4,I think that's one of the most important things in crypto going forward it's probably not what you learned at the Bitcoin conference with all the cool guys and the presidential people and the celebrities no this is actually a really serious stuff here and this is going to affect everybody especially those that actually care about their freedom and autonomy in this space that's all I have please like And subscribe I will talk to you soon,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
gHwSivNAmj4,in today's video we're going to be covering what is going on with circle and BlackRock and their U.S treasuries and also what the heck the IRS is doing to the FTX users this should be surprising but unfortunately it's not surprising so before we get into today's update if you guys have been enjoying these daily videos go ahead and hit like if you haven't done so already and hit subscribe because we're putting them out every single day if you don't know what our cryptocurrency portfolio looks like what trade alerts we are doing what our thoughts are on the current market conditions you have to check out a link to the CT Club that is just for you down below in the video description so right off the bat let's talk about Circle because this is usdc it is a huge stable coin issuer and there's all of this uh a talk now if the US were to default on its debts what would that look like for a USD based stable coin and circle apparently has had a plan for this in place for several months and in fact what they're doing right now is they are not holding U.S treasuries that expire longer than June that's a couple weeks away short-term treasuries means more liquidity for them to turn over uh for backing their stable coin,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
gHwSivNAmj4,but also it's very reflective of their own faith or lack thereof of the U.S debt and its ability to honor that debt that's something that a lot of countries have a lot of faith in maybe that's wavering and something to pay attention to in terms of cryptocurrency especially is a lot of people love the Oasis that a stablecoin can provide but when we're going up against Fiat currencies there's other Oasis that I think are much much more have a lot more longevity think Bitcoin maybe just a hint there not Financial advice just my opinion so moving on also we have to talk about binance they are trying to be compliant anywhere they can and the fact that they are uh turning their attention away from the U.S because they've been struggling to gain 100 you know regulatory Clarity or approval uh in that Country Now binance is saying that they're going to do whatever they can get to be regulatory compliant in the UK so uh big the largest cryptocurrency exchange is uh trying to find where the Greener pasture is we'll see if UK is that lastly we have to talk about FTX and the IRS the IRS has now filed a claim for FTX for basically taxes that the IRS is owed from FTX to the tune of 44 billion dollars these are for crypto transactions that were reported for transactions happening between FTX and elevator research I think there's one one claim alone is like worth like 20.9 billion dollars and this is because they're going after this because Sam Beckman freed and his girlfriend I don't know if they're still together,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
gHwSivNAmj4,anymore,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
gHwSivNAmj4,Caroline they are U.S citizens and so as such they are subject to the IRS and here's the most uh disappointing part is that the IRS is claiming to have administrative priority that means that their claims supersede those of anyone who is an unsecured creditor of FTX AKA anyone who had funds on FTX at the time that it collapsed Taxman is going to get their money so that's why you should be sure to get yours and to do so by a really good way to do that is to avoid using centralized exchanges as your wallet provider there's excellent wallet providers out there that do not have custody over your coins and allow you to move them freely at your own will whenever you want to for whatever reason you want to if you want to know which uh wallets I I consider to be secure there's links for Ledger and trezor down below in the video description there are also affiliate links for those of you who want to help support this channel otherwise just go to ledger.com or treasure.io and get yourself a hardware wallet if you haven't done so already it's going to wrap it up for today's video thanks for watching bye guys,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4, all right we got to talk about it what the heck is going on with the Ledger and their newest firmware update soon to come uh what does this mean for all ledger users what does this mean for the security of Hardware wallets in general I have a lot of thoughts about this but I'm going to talk about basically the update who it affects uh steps moving forward what to be aware of and my opinions welcome to crypto tips today is not my favorite most favorite at all video to make but,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,probably a very very I mean I know this to be a very important video to to be publishing out so thank you everyone for tuning in and for being aware of what's happening with self-custody and with the largest Hardware wallet company uh that should be at the Forefront of this so right off the bat Ledger is rolling out a new recover tool service basically this is like the number one fear of new people coming into cryptocurrencies is that um what if I lose my private key what if I lose all my crypto where is the help desk that will help me get it back and Ledger trying to appeal to the masses the people who don't know any better the people who don't understand the importance of self self-custody they're trying to appeal to them by unleashing this new tool that requires things like uh kyc which is identifying proving your identity over the owner of private Keys um and also you know not just that,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,but also like having a video uh FaceTime probably type of experience to prove your identity and what this process means is basically you have your Ledger you have your seed phrase that you've generated and let's say you're a crypto newbie and you want to have help you want to have a backup plan in case you lose that what you're going to do is you're going to having had this firmware update and if you're buying a new Ledger this might already automatically be installed on your device especially if you're buying a ledger Nano X which currently is the only Nano device available for this firmware update where you will if you want to do this service it's an additional 9.99 9.99 a month for this service and and what you're going to do is on your device and on your Ledger live you're going to say that you want to do the service you want to opt into this and you will confirm this on your device and they're saying that's going to create the ability for your device to generate a backup of your recovery phrase it will encrypt that recover that backup that additional backup in a certain way that will basically encrypt it will it will turn your Ledger into a multi-sig type wallet where three out of the two signatures will be required to regain access to your coins if you were to lose them the three entities being Ledger coin cover and a third company that they are not publicly announcing on their website at least I'm not sure if they said this in their announcement on Twitter I think I've read somewhere on Twitter uh someone found what that third company is but the fact that it's just two out of the three that they're being public about is enough to raise some suspicions you get let's say you lost your recovery phrase and so you go to Ledger you say,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,okay I need to enact this uh assisted backup and Ledger and coin cover or the other company can come forward and combine these fractions uh and encrypted forms of your backup together to give your coins back here is where a lot of skepticism concerns and fear is coming from Ledger users people who have always been vocal against Ledger especially are being very loud but here's my point is that even as someone who's a Die Hard Ledger fan we should always be skeptical about anything that we cannot verify and Ledger has been great it's a hardware wallet that I've supported for years I've talked about it,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,I've suggested it as an option for people to use as their Hardware wallet device to secure their cryptocurrencies because I've used Ledger it's a first and basically only Hardware wallet that I use most often in fact that might be changing very soon uh unfortunately but we always have to stay on our toes right and being skeptical is what will keep us and our cryptocurrency is secure in a Southern self-custody fashion so again a quick recap this is for if for those of you who are already Ledger users this is going to roll out in the newest firmware update so if you don't want anything to do with this don't update your Ledger firmware additionally this is only going to be allowed right now for The Ledger Nano X version or device soon to be The Ledger Nano S Plus and The Ledger Stacks but it will not be able to be applied to The Ledger Nano s so for those of you who are still holding on to that that OG Ledger device you might be in the clear although I know that those devices are pretty old by now and maybe a little bit dilapidated,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,so I think if you are a user of a ledger Ledger Nano s count yourself lucky at this point because right now we don't know the new attack vectors that this is going to unleash for Ledger users I'm not I'm trying my best not to instill on any kind of fud or Panic I'm just trying to keep you guys updated so that you can make an educated decision on where you're going to hold your cryptos now this whole ability of this is where the controversy comes from with Ledger is because Ledger software is completely open source everything about Ledger is open source except their secure element which is a little physical chip that they have in their Hardware wallet devices this is closed source so because of that there's always been a requirement or a level of trust with Ledger Hardware wallets now for me my own peace of mind with Ledger has always been in the fact that they've been around since 2014 and have never suffered a hack from their Hardware wallet devices their devices have never been hacked and so for me that is still a positive in that there's now these accusations that this secure element maybe has always had a back door or at the very least this firmware will allow it to have a back door because there's these concerns where this recovery system service will allow your chip in your device to not only generate your seed phrase which is what it normally does but also to export that seed phrase to these other third parties that is the huge concern that's because that's something that ledger time and again and in fact in in their announcement on Twitter about this new Recovery Service they've said about three or four times the CTO so said that the secure element chip or this the chip does not have access to your recovery phrase it cannot send your recovery phrase elsewhere it begs the question,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,well then how are these fragmented uh private Keys essentially being sent to these third parties is it from the chip or is it the user that has to physically send this private key basically to these third parties either way this is where my disappointment comes in because in my opinion Ledger is and has been maybe that's changing right now in my opinion a Cornerstone of self-custody and cryptocurrency and a company that helps people take real true ownership over their cryptocurrency and should be at the Forefront of that type of education now they're going soft in my opinion very very soft and at the end of this video I'm going to explain why that might be happening with some recent regular patients coming out of Europe but now they're saying you know what we need to be more marketable to the masses we need to appeal to the masses so now what we're seeing is one of the the greatest crypto companies in my opinion are are succumbing to the pressures of the masses instead of trying to encourage these people to rise up to this ability to self-custody their cryptocurrencies instead of you know they're not trying to now educate people on the importance of self-custody they're saying you know what I know it's really hard why don't you um trust third parties who you don't know personally and who can very easily be changed in the future if these companies were to go out of business if these companies were to suffer data breaches themselves these companies not to mention this whole multi-sig recovery service requires two out of three to come together to sign to re uh to gain access to your coins that's a pretty small number for for multi-sig not to mention the fact that they are now publicly announced for the world to know for governments to know for hackers to know if they wanted to Target or put pressure on these companies to Fork over information for the sake of let's say National Security or whatever reason they might want to portray to gain instant access to the fact that not only you own crypto but this is your private key and they have your name full kyc information a video of your face basically saying yes this is really me this is really my cryptocurrencies there's a whole lot of conflict of interest here that I am really turned off by and I am not alone and I have to apologize if this does end up being the worst case scenario for Ledger then you know I've only done as much as I can based on what I've known about this company and it was always in a good faith basically and always in an effort to help you self-custody so if Ledger isn't the end-all be-all which it never really was but it was a great it is maybe it was I don't know my tenses are going to be mixed up here a little bit um one of the best hardware wallets especially for things like decentralized exchanges and D5 it had a ton of uh interoperability and Integrations on a lot of innovative new cryptocurrency platforms,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,so you know what the next best option is,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,and maybe the first best option right now is trezor I think that treasure is going to be probably inundated with orders at this point because trezor is 100 open source there are pros and cons to this now the pros of Ledger having the secure element being closed source is that it's never been hacked treasure several years back um during a hackathon basically was uh found out to have a type of vulnerability where if your treasure is in the hands of someone who has a very specialized type of computer for let's say 15 minutes and they have your treasure device they do not have your private key they do not have your password they could basically Brute Force into your treasure device so there is trezor isn't uh the end all be all Hardware wallet but in my opinion it still is very very good and secure option because especially if you're able to secure your actual device in a very uh good way that keeps it out of the hands of someone who might have a super powerful capable computer able to uh to make that hack happen I think trezor is an excellent resource also cold card is another one that's been uh you know talked about is I think it's specifically for Bitcoin most most other Hardware wallets are specific for Bitcoin and don't have so much interoperability with things like D5 staking decentralized exchanges before I go into all of that maybe that will be the next video or a video in the future of next steps and Best Hardware wallets that are an option for you guys I've done tutorials on trezor in the past if you guys want to check that one out there's also a link for you can just go to treasure.io and order your own Hardware wallet there I have an affiliate link down below if you want to help support this Channel with trezor,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,I'm really trying to keep an even mind here in that we don't know everything maybe this announcement from Ledger wasn't as best planned as it could have been I don't think they shed a lot of info information especially considering the fact that most of Ledger users are pretty intelligent in terms and literate in terms of cryptocurrencies and so they can see these huge red flags for what they are is ledger sacrificing their old customer base in favor of trying to be marketable for the millions and hundreds of millions of masses that they're trying that they're kind of slobbering uh you know after to get in in their market share so anyway we're still figuring out the best case scenario we're trying to get as much information as we can,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,and I'm sure I'm going to be making several updated videos for this we haven't heard a whole lot from Ledger themselves in regards to this backlash there now what I mentioned earlier in today's video is uh could this be that ledger is being pressured by Regulators by governments around the world to the need to identify who owns Which cryptocurrency wallets that has a lot to do with the new Mica regulations coming out of your Europe that will be tomorrow's video so if you guys want to learn more about those crazy new regulations and my thoughts and if they're actually going to be able to be enforced and what that means for crypto users in Europe go ahead and hit subscribe because that video is coming out tomorrow you don't want to miss it if you guys appreciated this update I know it's not good news,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
rS2v_uoyoe4,but it's much more important in my opinion to keep you guys updated rather than make you you know feel super good about yourself all the time I think it's much more important to be educated and furthermore I just want to end this video with the always the reminder that you guys are absolutely capable of self-custody that is where we should be elevating ourselves and our expectation because coddling new cryptocurrency users is a disservice to those users and to the cryptocurrency industry as a whole let's be better let's do better let's self custody and do so in a safe manner is ledger still that option I don't know yet I'll keep you posted anyway thank you guys for watching I'll see you tomorrow,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,in this video I'm gonna tell you guys how you can make up to 100 per day by trading crypto over on buy bit or bit flex or binance really it doesn't matter which exchange you choose personally in this video I am going to be using buy bit but links will be down below to all of the exchanges that I am using uh when I am trading myself this is a continuation video of my previous video 100 per day on buy bit you can go and check that video link down below if you haven't seen that go check it out but let's dive straight into these strategies I'm gonna show you to do so it's very important first of all that you know that this video is not a financial advice it's all about just providing some strategies that I'm using and it's up to you if you want to use them or not to get started you need to deposit funds either in the form of Fiat or crypto over to buy bit for this you can click my link in the description to buy bits if you click my link you can get actually up to 30 thousand dollars in deposit bonus now that you have a buy bit account and that you have up to thirty thousand dollars in bonus there so let's get straight into how to identify a coin or token to trade so in part one I talked about um how you can trade ethereum but today I'm gonna show the Bitcoin chart but this doesn't mean that you cannot use other altcoins personally I'm gonna use coin market cap today because it allows us to check many different cryptocurrencies and analyze them and also sort them by the highest gains and losses in the past 24 hours to see which tokens are trending you can even search new tokens for a category we can consider using this method for checking an altcoin trending tokens are always good,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,so right now there's a lot of uh trending AI tokens crypto games trading there are E5 metaverse you have so many different trending coins and tokens and I would suggest trying to go with those and of course meme coins is the latest big thing people are talking about would be great to trade for sure so after selecting your altcoin or Bitcoin it's time to show you this part number two here so you need trading patterns to identify them in the charts to trade them now to trade up to 100 per day you need trading view I do have a link down below to trading view if you want to use it personally I'm using the pro version but it is completely free if you want to use it,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,and as I mentioned earlier I have selected Bitcoin however you may choose any other token that you prefer it is essential to keep in mind that besides Bitcoin all other altcoins are even more volatile which indicates that while there is potential for more profit there is also the risk of bigger losses very important so it is very crucial to use risk management and whenever we do trading we have to make sure that we don't use too much leverage never more than 20x in my opinion so we have to create a market order you choose your leverage and then you determine whether you prefer a limit order or a market order then you choose the amount of usdt you wish to allocate towards opening this trade click on either long or short depending on the trading pattern and then that's done as I said in this video I'm going to use Bitcoin against USD pair and I will use trading view website to explain to you some of these patterns and as I said earlier I'm using buy bit,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,but you can also use bitflix actually with bitflix you can get 50 sign up and deposit bonus if you deposit 100 so go below this video and try bitflix if you haven't tried it already it's a great alternative to buy bits bitflix buy bit binance okx there are so many exchanges out there they all do pretty much the same thing but I choose buy bit for this video,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,so let's talk about the bull flag Bear Flag a great way to make you 100 per day is the Bull and Bear Flags let's start with the bull flag one of my favorite patterns because it's very easy to trade the bull flag pattern consists of two main components a flagpole and a flag the flagpole is an initial sharp and strong upward moving price often characterized by high trading volume it represents a period of intense buying pressure and indicates a significant surge in demand on the other side the flag starts to be created after the flagpole where a period of consolidation follows the uptrend where the price retraces in a relatively structured and restricted range these consolidation forms a rectangular shape that we call the flag the Flag represents a temporary pause or a period of profit taking after the initial price surge as you can see here in the Bitcoin chart this bull flag has this descending parallel lines indicating a relatively stable range of prices this one is the support and this one is the resistance and it should not slope downwards or exhibit significantly volatility usually the price stays between this support and resistance lines during the flag formation the trend of the volume usually goes down when volume goes down that's usually a great sign that a huge breakout is coming,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,so how do we trade this how do we measure the target as as I said earlier a bull flag is followed by an uptrend so to measure the target you can use a line here you take the pole you put it up like this,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,and then you get the potential Target remember when we trade this type of pattern we should take profit before we hit the target because as you know the crypto Market is volatile sometimes things change fast so take profit slightly before the target but when do we enter the trade you should start the trade when the pattern concludes with a breakout to the upside where the price breaks the resistance line of the flag this breakout is often accompanied by an increase in trading volume and signals resumption of the initial uptrend you should use this breakout as a Buy Signal to enter a long position and if you add leverage to your position you can profit even more but it's also important to use a stop loss and take profit you can place a take profit before the target like I mentioned earlier and your stop loss should be in the strong support Zone under the support line like this the second pattern you can use is a bear flag and in fact everything is the exact same instead of longing you can short A Bear Flag,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,so it's really the same no need to go through the same thing again the target is the exact same as you can see I take the line I put it down and the target is same and also how to enter the trade is actually the exact same as well the next pattern you can trade is the symmetrical triangle here we can clearly see a symmetrical triangle we just need to connect all these descending resistance points and all the ascending support points and there is a symmetrical triangle here now this can be a bullish or bearish pattern and to measure the target of a symmetrical triangle you need to measure between the support and resistance of the symmetrical triangle and from the breakout this should take you to the Target perfectly either to the up or down side now where's your entry the entry is at the very end of the symmetrical triangle when you see a candle breaking the resistance or support if it breaks the descending resistance line it's time to open a long position if it breaks the support line however it's a time for a short position our last pattern is the ascending wedge before I dive into the important part of this segment make sure to go and watch part number one of this how to make a hundred dollars per day by trading that video is very very important and also very important is to sign up to buy a bit or bitflix with buy bit you can get 30 000 bonus if you deposit some crypto with bitflix you can get fifty dollars if you deposit only a hundred dollars so for all of you whales out there keep trading on buy,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,but if you are smaller you can definitely go to bitflix with just a small 100 deposit to get your fifty dollars so yeah links down below so an ascending wedge is a technical pattern often observed in crypto trading charts it is a bearish reversal pattern and indicates a potential Trend reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend the pattern is formed by two converging trend lines with the lower trend line acting and support and the upper trend line acting as resistance both going to the upside as you can see right here usually there's a significant uptrend in the price of the cryptocurrency before the ascending wedge formation then the lower trend line connects the price lows acting at support level while the upper trend line connects to price highs acting as the resistance level to measure the target you just take the height of the pattern like this and then put it like that,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
JURWTuNHnvc,and then you want to know where to enter the trade eventually the price of the crypto typically breaks out of the ascending wedge pattern the breakout could be bearish and could be bullish obviously if you break the resistance here you want to put in Long position if we break the support here you want to put in a short position it is very important to know everything about patterns if you want to make a hundred dollars per day if you really want to make a hundred dollars per day then for sure subscribe to my YouTube channel follow my daily videos because in my daily videos I make technical analysis on bitcoin ethereum meme coins and D5 coins crypto gaming coins because there I show you this strategy in practice how to actually put these trades in real time so make sure to subscribe right now and I will see you guys in the next video but make sure to click this video first this is an Incredible video click it right now see you over there bye bye foreign,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hvg97_g1Ntc, well we have the creator of open AI create a coin but there's a catch plus uh coinbase is in trouble with the US once more and also Paul Tudor Jones says something that I actually kind of agree with uh but first like And subscribe check us down below for our CT Club where we get our trade alerts portfolio updates and you get to see what we are buying during this accumulation phase all right so this is from Mark Jeffrey all right so he he's quoting off a telegraph which said Sam Altman the CEO of open AI uh has close to clinching 100 million dollars in funding for a cryptocurrency called World coin hmm strange why not just stick with Bitcoin because it's pretty good coin right well here's the catch it requires an eyeball scan to create private keys which is he says is is as dystopian as it gets so yeah,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hvg97_g1Ntc,I'm not going to be promoting that coin on this channel I don't promote very many coins and definitely not that one next we have Paul Tudor Jones who says BTC has a real problem now because the entire apparatus of the U.S Regulators uh are now against it and yeah he's right it's unfortunate Bitcoin is going to flow to places where it's least restricted that's just how things go that's how money flows you know so for instance the UAE you have uh El Salvador money's flowing there because they have an open arm policy essentially over there and it's tax-free so yeah you can't beat it right so unfortunately this is only going to get worse as Heidi and I have said for years now many people have like really bashed Us in the beginning saying no you're crazy stop saying this garbage but now it's coming out like hey they're really cracking down on bitcoin and and also crypto as well all right so now speaking of cracking down we have coinbase which is likely to face SCC enforcement action similar to bittrex and Kraken,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hvg97_g1Ntc,I mean I hope nobody is surprised with news like this uh you know like I said Heidi and I have been telling people this is only going to get worse and by the week it's getting worse which is ironic that they're holding the Bitcoin 2023 conference in the US considering how badly they have treated this space let's move on to another Western superpower we have the European Union passing laws requiring identification for all crypto transactions ah really that's probably why Ledger has come out in the open saying hey they're just getting people used to probably uh kyc and their customers so here's some of the details that you finance ministers have approved the world's first comprehensive cryptocurrency rules coming from the financial times all exchanges and wallet providers must be licensed names of senders and recipients of transactions must be recorded regardless of the amount uh,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hvg97_g1Ntc,yes so they're going to be really cracking down we all know why they're doing this this is this shouldn't be a surprise to anybody you know for the new currency that is coming out I can't say it because I'll get Shadow ban uh but that is what is happening right now it's a com a uh Bitcoin is in Bitcoin and and all other cryptocurrencies are a direct competitor to a centralized Fiat system okay this is why we promote Bitcoin you know okay uh next we have Elon Musk who says Twitter plans to create a more efficient Financial system than traditional banking now here's the catch here a lot of people trust Elon Musk I personally don't and why don't I look at all the funding that he got from the US government I'll just say one 500 million dollars from the Department of Defense to help him out with his neural link program why would they give him 500 million dollars,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
hvg97_g1Ntc,yeah doesn't make sense so I don't trust the guy whatsoever and if he's going to and look at who the new CEO of uh Twitter is she is a a lover of the world economic Forum say no more next we have U.S citizens debt passes 17 trillion dollars for the first time in history yes,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

aVqgcXXKG5o,hey everyone I have a really quick update for you regarding Ledger recover service if you might remember earlier uh last week May 16th Ledger had the announcement of their recover service and with that came a lot of backlash of Ledger users uh people who are always kind of critical of Ledger and the fact that they aren't open source and Ledger has listened this is what happens when the user base shows the kind of power that it has when you start demanding better so now Ledger is pausing this update of recover it is not going to happen until they're saying until they open source more of their code they're going to start with core components of their operating system also they're going to be releasing a white paper of The Ledger recovery service so that uh in make it open source so that people can really understand more explicitly how it works maybe to quell some fears and some miscommunication as well they're going to try to make it as open source as a Raspberry Pi so that's kind of their base that they're aiming for I don't think it's going to happen all of a sudden but slowly but surely they will release recover service once they have made it more open source so that they can grant more transparency to people for how it works um I'm not convinced that still exporting your private keys to three different companies that can get pinched in terms of a government subpoena to get your information is any kind of a robust system for storing your cryptocurrencies securely but at least they're becoming more open source so this is kind of a good news still uh I mean you tell me in the comments if you still trust Ledger company I think we're gonna have to wait and see what this actual open source code shows because it hasn't been open source,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
aVqgcXXKG5o,yet so we're definitely going to be expecting a lot more people with technical backgrounds to be analyzing this newly open source code and giving their feedback on what they see the good the bad the ugly I'm sure so the good news is at least they are pausing this Ledger recover service and they are open sourcing more of their code they don't say that they're going to be 100 open source um so they're trying but let me know in the comments down below if you guys have uh any optimism on the future of Ledger is that too far gone to regain their trust um I don't I'm on the fence I am still looking for other Hardware wallet options out there and I will be doing videos every week presenting other Hardware wallet options that I think could be contenders if nothing else this served as an excellent reminder for myself,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
aVqgcXXKG5o,and I think for a lot of other people to decentralize the way that you are holding your cryptocurrencies especially if you're using a hardware wallet company that is awfully big and maybe located in a jurisdiction where regulations with cryptocurrencies and wallet providers could demand that they need things like kyc um I'm not the only one to make that link between the mica regulations and this new move with Ledger uh with the recovery service and allowing for kyc as well just keeping you guys posted on this update kind of good news um not everything that we would want to hear from Ledger I think uh it's hard to come back from this one but anyway we'll keep you posted on what's Happening next if you enjoy these updates hit like hit subscribe I'll see you tomorrow,overall_free_search.csv,0.0

mPnzSYTG6iY, we here at altcoin Buzz have discovered the next big game-changing crypto narrative for big gains we've been talking about it plenty it may not necessarily come as a surprise it is privacy but the fact is there are lots of projects in the space chasing after this narrative there are at least two dozen projects out there by our account whose major focus is privacy So today we're reviewing three of our favorites three privacy focused altcoins that we ourselves have invested in [Music] oh welcome to the channel my name is Maddie and this is altcoin Buzz do not forget about our new partnership with Bible they are giving away 30 000 in bonuses you also stand a chance to win a new iPhone 14. check out the links in the description of this video or stick around till the end,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mPnzSYTG6iY,and I'll explain it in a little more detail best of luck as always if you choose to invest just remember that I'm not an official Financial or investment advisor and so this video of course is not official Financial or investment advice we're starting off our list here at number one with a look at Mina protocol ticker m-i-n-a Mina and the protocol is unique first of all its size is Tiny,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mPnzSYTG6iY,it's only 22 kilobytes and although usage can grow its size always remains constant and Mina works with ZK snarks so this means zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge that's in a nutshell what this is but here's an even simpler explanation you prove something without providing any insight into what needs to be proved in other words you confirm information without revealing that information in the process that's the same as with all ZK technology but here's what Mina protocol can do specifically so it can run Mina on your mobile phone at the same time you run a full node by the way and it can verify long calculations for accuracy it can also verify data sets without knowing all the details and these are very much the ZK snarks at work and in action Mina does not share the data even if requested however it does share proof of data and it can also interact with websites other blockchains don't or can't do this but Mina can access real-life data it's almost like an Oracle in that sense because Mina's ZK apps take care of this seamlessly so those are some of the pros of mina now let's take a big picture and consider some of the cons to be fair so for instance the biggest issue is,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mPnzSYTG6iY,is that it's got a pretty low and slow transaction speed it has a TPS or transactions per second of 22.,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mPnzSYTG6iY,now that's marginally better compared to bitcoin with seven TPS however if we look at other chains Solana for example it has 50 000 TPS or sui with a potential of 200 000 TPS that's really our only knock against Mina hopefully in the future it's something that will be remedied but on the whole we love this project and if you do as well you can buy it on buy bit and take part in that promotional campaign that I talked about and we'll also mention again at the end of this video privacy altcoin number two that we're looking at today is secret Network ticker s CRT and secret network is really one of those quiet builders that keep working in the background without necessarily a lot of fanfare they are all about privacy they are ogs in this space as you may know secret is one of the 59 owns in the cosmos IBC also known as the internet of blockchains and secret has some pretty interesting and new recent updates let's take a look at these there is for instance their latest Network upgrade I am happy to report that the network is now on version 1.9 however the team calls it IBC V4 plus vrf it's kind of like a revamped version of the IC protocol it now offers secret surge this is a defy incentives campaign you can earn extra rewards up to four million dollars actually when providing liquidity in secret apps so for instance shade blade Sienna swap or secret swap you can take advantage from April until October there's secret vrf a verifiable random function which is an API it randomly generates numbers and works cross-chain so for instance and just as one example it makes nft minting gaming or Dows secure and when it comes to minting it adds random traits and numbering so in gaming boot boxes or gambling all of this needs to be random and the vrf takes care of this it also emphasizes the start of privacy as a service they also offer packet forward middleware this moves assets or data around in a much simpler way you can now route IBC packets with a single transaction and it's between various chains by the way there's also the IBC emergency button and this can temporarily halt IBC transactions so for instance when somebody steals funds on an IBC Dex it needs a multi-sig address and governance approval and finally there's the secret tunnel this replaces older bridges for ethereum and BSC and the tunnel is on axillar so on the whole we have another privacy chain with plenty of impressive features change that key building during the bear Market are always going to catch our attention and in this case they're building great things we are impressed and they're most likely going to Surge in the next Bull Run at least in our opinion this is certainly a project that we have placed our faith in and another such project last but not least on our list at number three today is LF zero ticker,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
mPnzSYTG6iY,a-z-e-r-o and for context the original cyberpunks who helped get Bitcoin started in the first place were all about privacy that was really a top priority they were all cryptography guys and they shared this belief that Tech could either improve personal privacy or destroy it really it had the potential to do both and with that pedigree in mind it's exactly what lf0 is trying to accomplish they are very much trying to preserve personal privacy this is one of our favorite projects overall that's one reason it is at least and it's definitely a favorite in the Privacy sector and they have a couple of exciting new features on the horizon and they're all private see enhanced so for example there's tangent this is a hardware wallet and has the size of a credit card however it requires an NFC phone and this is technology that allows for contactless payments it's open source and does not collect user data then there's also signer this is a browser extension that helps you manage your private Keys it's not a wallet but think of it rather as a solution that can hold a secret there's also dashboard and this is already live you can manage your a0 and related coins here so for things like staking bonding or unbonding and it has a very friendly user interface a0id,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
mPnzSYTG6iY,this is the first ever private domain system liminal 1.0 so the Privacy enhancing layer for lf0 with ZK technology this is going to hit the streets this year in 2023 and liminal 2.0 will soon follow and is the full version and finally we have common a decentralized exchange which will launch in 2023 if you stake a0 you are eligible for a common token airdrop just want to remind you once again and as I talked about at the beginning of the video you can win up to thirty thousand dollars just click the link in the description below and if you have any further doubts or questions you can also check out our dedicated and detailed explainer video I will also include that in the description,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
71QDeb_R4Do, well folks we did it we're finally seeing our portfolios in the green again it's been a very very long year,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
71QDeb_R4Do,but it's good to see some happiness come back into the markets now we aren't anywhere near our previous levels but seeing crypto up 10 to 20 on the week and certain projects of 50 it honestly brings happy tears into my eyes but the real question is will this last though or will it just turn out to be another pump fake where we have a little jump but come right back down now don't worry because from what I see I think we've already hit our bottom for Bitcoin which was about sixteen thousand dollars back in December now I go more in depth in my previous video about why I think this is so if you guys want to check it out make sure you guys do that but check it out after watching this video first but if my predictions are right and we have hit our bottom for Bitcoin there are certain coins that we should be looking into to capitalize on this and that's exactly who I'll be going over in today's video I'll be sharing my top three cryptos that you guys should be looking into for the month of March 2023.,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
71QDeb_R4Do,now this is gonna be be a good one so make sure you guys watch all the way through and as always make sure you guys smash that like button subscribe if you guys haven't already I make videos all about crypto and how you can become rich from it so if that interests you guys make sure you guys subscribe also congrats to those that picked up Aptos after watching my last video I mentioned it when it was about three dollars and now we're sitting at close to 13 so Props to you guys all right first up we have xrp or Ripple now before you guys click out of this video hear what I have to say because if it wasn't something big I wouldn't be mentioning this to you guys anyway now as we all know Ripple and the SEC have been going through a lawsuit for well it feels like forever at this point I think it's been like over two years now which is honestly insane also I just want to clarify because I see a lot of people confuse the two Ripple and xrp are two completely different things people think they are the same,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
71QDeb_R4Do,but they really aren't Ripple is a technology company that develops blockchain based solutions for payments and other things and xrp on the other hand is a cryptocurrency that is used to facilitate transactions on Ripple's payment Network and the SEC is suing the company Ripple not the crypto xrp now I'm not going to bore you guys with all the details of why the lawsuit is going on I'm sure you guys already know or you can obviously just look it up I'm here to show you guys why I think xrp will be a good buy because of this lawsuit now recently the CEO of Ripple came out and said the ruling of this lawsuit will most likely be reached towards the first half of 2023 which leaves us with only about one to two months before we hear what the final verdict is now the reason this is big is because one this has been going on for over two years now so there's a lot of eyes on this lawsuit and two the verdict or the decision that's gonna happen is not only important to Ripple an xrp but also for the whole crypto ecosystem because xrp is a top 10 coin so if Ripple wins this we're gonna see some crazy stuff happen because for the past two years xrp has just been there no one's been talking about it exchanges like coinbase and crypto.com have even removed it from their exchanges because of what's going on with the lawsuit and even with all that xrp still managed to hold its rank as a top 10 crypto which is honestly super impressive and it just goes to show how much people believe in this project and not to mention xrp didn't even get to partake in the biggest crypto Boron that we saw in history yes people could buy and probably were at the time but no one was because there were just so much uncertainty with this lawsuit and with everything going on I mean xrp did even pass his all-time high from back in 2017 which every other coin did from what I can see there is just so much tension and pressure built up within xrp if if that makes sense to you guys because tons of people truly do believe in the project and do want to buy it,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
71QDeb_R4Do,I mean it's an OG coin back in 2017 everybody was going crazy for it but now people are hesitant and just waiting and waiting for a result and I think with all this pressure being built up for almost two years now once the result does come out whether good or bad we're gonna see some really big effects in the market and I want you guys to know xrp and ripple are not just any other project in the crypto space I'd go far as to say no other project is doing or can do what they're doing especially with global banking,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
71QDeb_R4Do,so how this all works on a large scale is global Banks use Ripple's payment Network to send and receive payments with other banks that are also on Ripple's Network so for example if a bank wants to send US dollars to a bank in China it could use xrp to convert those dollars into xrp and then convert the xrp into Japanese Yen on the other end now because of this you can get faster and more efficient Global Payments and transactions can be settled in seconds rather than days and it can also be a lot cheaper and eliminate the need of middlemen and foreign exchange fees which will save the banks a lot of money that that's one of the reasons why these large Banks bank xrp because it'll save them a lot of money and just make things very easy for them now like I said xrp and ripple have been at this for years now and have huge probably the biggest banks behind them and if it wasn't for this lawsuit I honestly think xrp would be closer to 510 maybe even the 15 price ranges so in my opinion I think the price we're at right now is still very cheap compared to the long-term potential that xrp has now obviously a lot of the price ties down to what the final verdict of this case will be but remember even if Ripple loses this lawsuit that doesn't mean xrp will just vanish because remember they are two separate things from one another now yes the effects will still have an impact on xrp's price but the way the Ripple team has been fighting for this for over the past two years and just how much work they put into everything I don't doubt they have a good contingency plan set as well alright if we look at the price action for xrp currently it's ranked number six for coin market cap price of 39 cents um up only two percent on the week when all these other coins are up 16 10 13 only up two percent um obviously it's because of the lawsuit and everything going on xrp just doesn't get any attention like I mentioned um if we head over here to the technicals um if we add in some trend lines we're definitely like an upward Trend over here and we also for the Lux all go indicator,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
71QDeb_R4Do,we also have a strong signal so honestly in the short term if you want to trade this xrp is a good buy obviously this is not more so of a technical play it's more so of a fundamental play but if we compare the old all-time high three dollars to where we're at right now that and if we were to buy at these price levels right now that'll put us at a 669 return if we end up going back to all-time high levels which I really do think we can if not even pass it and head over to five ten dollar levels because xrp is solving a multi-multi-trillion dollar problem and it has Banks legit the largest banks in the world in its pocket so I really do think once we see the outcome of this lawsuit and if we really do see it in the next couple months not only xrp but the whole crypto ecosystem will have a big effect also I I forgot to mention uh for these indicators a lot of you guys are always curious about them um I use Lux,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
71QDeb_R4Do,algo it's basically an indicator that tells me when to buy and sell it works with a whole bunch of different assets you can go over here and use it for stocks Forex crypto anything on Trading video just sits on your trading view chart and then you can customize this to however you like I've been using this I've talked about them plenty of times I've been using them for years as well definitely an awesome indicator if you guys want to check it out I'll put a link to it down below definitely change this is the whole trading game especially for me and I know it'll help you guys as well if you guys are into trading so this lawsuit even though a lot of people aren't talking about it right now and there's not a lot of press around it,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
71QDeb_R4Do,I promise you when the time comes in one to two months everyone is going to be talking about xrp in this lawsuit and it'll have a huge impact on the crypto Market all right next up on the list is H bar or hedera hashcraft now I feel like I talked about this coin before but honestly it's such a sleeper coin that a lot of people still aren't paying any attention to it so it needs some more attention now the reason to look out for hbar is because it's the only project of its source nobody else is doing what they're doing and nobody can do what they're doing either see what makes hbar unique is that it's governed by a council of probably the most elite companies in the world companies like Google LG T-Mobile IBM Tata and tons of other ones and how this console works is each one of these companies has an equal voting right on decisions for the project and they can only be on the council for six years so there's always a new set of ideas coming in as well now what also makes hbr unique is that as of right now they are the only hashgraph coin and the hashgraph protocol is an open source protocol so other projects and coins can be built on it as well so hbar has a first movers advantage and they also partner with Dell and added them to their console list as well now if you look closely at the companies on their Council they have huge internet companies like IBM Dell Google these are companies that pretty much run the internet so hpar has this huge network of elite companies pretty much just in their hands and just imagine how much potential and the things they can do with this,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
71QDeb_R4Do,alright if we look at the price action for H bar hedera currently the price is eight cents down four percent on the week which I I don't know why it's down because every other crypto is up on the week but nonetheless it's a good opportunity to buy in that case because you never want to be buying when crypto's up so that's a goodbye if we look over at the price action um remember like I said in the last clip if you guys want these Buy sell signals which what I use when I make my trades or make any decisions on buying um I use Alexa I'll put the link to it down below you guys can just insert it into your trading view chart,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
71QDeb_R4Do,but um if we look at the four hour chart for hbar we're definitely an upward Trend I mean look at this where we hit a low of around three cents 3.8 cents um what is this 3.7 cents we hit a low and we've just been climbing ever since the thing with h-bar is it ties very well with xrp because it has those companies in that traditional factor to it you know like traditional companies traditional Banks tied to the coin so if xrp is lost to whatever happens with that I really think um it'll have a strong correlation with hbar because usually whatever happens with xrp I've noticed the same thing happens with uh H bar now obviously xrp doesn't move as much and there's different considerations to take with that coin I'm also going to be watching hbar closely as we get closer to the as we get closer to more information with the lawsuit but as far as price predictions I mean 50 cents was an all-time high I've seen a lot of people who are backing hbar and say each bar can easily go to you know a couple dollars five dollars um honestly I think that might be the case it just we just have to see how everything plays off with all these companies because yes they're on the council but are they really making any changes like are we going to see anything big is hbar gonna be integrated with these companies that's all for us get to see what happens,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
71QDeb_R4Do,and then that obviously will have a correlation with how high the price will go finally we have file coin now this is also a coin a lot of you probably already heard by now and I know I've talked about this plenty of times before but I can't stress how big this coin will be in the future currently it's around eight dollars but it's had an all-time high of close to 200 now file coin is all about storing data in a decentralized way basically today how Company Store data is they use platforms like Google or Amazon to store it,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
71QDeb_R4Do,and then Google and Amazon will build these massive server warehouses to store this data the problem with this is the servers that they build are centralized so if you're on the west coast and your server is on the East Coast you'll have performance issues and not to mention how long it'll take for you to access your data because the servers are just so far apart there are different parts of the country centralized servers are also very vulnerable to natural disasters like tornadoes or floods so if your server ever does just get knocked out because of a natural disaster well you can say bye bye to all your data and for big companies that's a very big issue everything you do online today is stored on a centralized server that can have power outages or just be shut down at any time with no notice to you I mean think about it if YouTube or Netflix just goes offline you have no videos to watch and that was all controlled by one company who owned that server that probably had no control as to why the server even went down we've seen this happen time and time again with Instagram for example there's a always some glitches going on our DM's not working apps crashing features just disappearing,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
71QDeb_R4Do,but if we had a peer-to-peer system like both filecoin is offering something like Instagram or YouTube or Netflix would never crash because all the data is stored on a decentralized server so it removes the chance of Errors happening so that's the issue follow coin is trying to solve their idea is to have someone like me or you'll be able to allow a big company to store data on our own personal computers and we'll be able to make money off of it as well this also makes storing data for these companies a lot cheaper because it brings more servers into the space that they can access from all over the world in different countries rather than just having it all in one spot alright and if we look at the price action for follow coin currently it's rig number 23 on coin market cap with a price of 8.26 up 64 on the week which is insane,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
71QDeb_R4Do,now I I look more into this there was never like a real reason why the price is up the best thing I found was there's some like changes coming to follow coin where they're implementing the filecoin virtual machine which will bring smart contracts to a file coin but I I don't think that's really the reason why they're up 64 on the week I mean just looking at this is honestly absurd um going from five dollars all the way up to eight dollars or even four dollars on here I mean the the awesome thing is this indicator called it out so if I was really looking into this and I bought this over here I could have made a really good uh profit but um as of right now if we head over here to the all-time high for file coin which I was talking about earlier the all-time high was close to two hundred dollars which is very very high but I just don't see it the price going to 200 again,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
71QDeb_R4Do,I think a good average price point for file corn would be between 100 to 150 now but even even at the price points where I are now at eight point three dollars um and if we go to like let's say 150 that's still 1700 return on your money so follow coin definitely has a lot of ways to go but that was it Guys these were my top three picks for the month of March I also want to throw an extra coin as well I know I mentioned Aptos earlier I still think it's a great coin with a lot of potential but I'm looking more into the coins within the Aptos ecosystem so something like mosquito Finance which is basically like the uni swap of Aptos are going to be like the uni swap of Aptos so if Aptos continues this growth it's on right now all the coins within the ecosystem will grow as well and I feel like mosquito finance will be a really good pick but let me know what other coins you guys are looking to as well down in the comments section below maybe I'll check them out,overall_free_search.csv,1.0

tQys0pCILzM,so we're down 93.2 percent yet it's still a great project that is doing terrific work behind the scenes it's just honestly kind of been dragged down by the rest of the crypto Market as has happened to a lot of other projects so this is very much a discounted project a discounted altcoin that still presents tremendous value this is a great opportunity in my opinion not Financial advice to pick up IMX on the cheap foreign okay moving right along to coin number two on our list we're taking a look at Oasis Network ticker is Rose r o s e now Oasis network is a Pioneer in privacy enabled blockchain because they focused on defy and data economy and Oasis offers unique privacy features for example they can create tokenized data which allows you to take control of your data and as a layer one chain they have impressive scalability as well which of course enables faster transactions and high throughput,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
tQys0pCILzM,but they can also use a sophisticated discrepancy detection tool and Oasis claims that this is more efficient than sharding and para chains near and soon ethereum those both use sharding and the pair chains are polka dot territory but in addition to that Oasis also boasts a very strong team a high value Venture capitalists are among their backers and they've also partnered with dap radar and furthermore Oasis has a 350 million dollar developer fund and their potential seems very high but admittedly they have a bit of a smaller ecosystem for the time being at the moment they are only involved in seven defy and three nft projects and this is exactly where they need to do some work and demonstrate some growth back in August we talked about Oasis in this video check out the link that should be popping up right about now but here's the update as far as tokenomics Rose is up at the time of this recording it's sitting at about 5.7 cents with a market cap of 287 million dollars now the max Supply is 10 billion of which we have 50 or 5 billion in circulation it is ranked number 128 by coinggecko.com it's recovering from the recent dip that it experienced in the last week or so we like the numbers overall let us know what you guys think about Rose in the comments below and let's go ahead and move on to coin number three which is Mina protocol ticker Mina m i n a this is the lightest blockchain by the way in the world it is only 22 kilobytes for context that's opposed to ethereum which is 500 gigabytes we're talking orders of magnitude here indifference,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
tQys0pCILzM,and so naturally this makes it very easy for anybody to set up a node anybody can do it and that's in contrast to the difficulty presented by certain other chains and Mina protocol's focus is on privacy and security specifically for web 3 they do this with ZK snark technology Mina has various strong backers which cumulatively allowed them to raise 92 million dollars it should be noted that three arrows capital is among them that's not everybody's favorite name so just pointing it out it's still a young project similar to the last entry on this list so they also have a relatively small ecosystem but that being said they still have a very impressive and a very extensive roadmap we also talked about Mina a few weeks ago in that August video check it out if you've not already the tokenomics are as follows Mina is up 6.7 percent at the time of this recording with the current price of 57.7 cents and a market cap of just under 410 million dollars now the max Supply is infinite so if you're not a fan of those kinds of tokenomics just take note of that but the circulating Supply right now is 588 million out of a 965 million total Supply they are listed right now in the top 100 ranked number 99 according to coinggecko.com their vesting is over eight years however one thing to look out for is that their token is inflationary and as I mentioned infinite but still there's lots of potential and we don't view that as a deal breaker although we understand that maybe some of you do if that's the case let us know your thoughts about Mina in the comments below and without any further Ado let's move on to coin number four our fourth altcoin which is priced under one dollar at a bargain it is Affinity ticker EFI which is a cross chain Super Highway bringing nfts to polka dot now look we love Affinity whether or not it's below one dollar in price but the fact that it is represents an incredible bargain in our opinion and we're big fans at least in part because Infinity was developed by engine and we are big fans of what they're doing the engine network has 20 million worldwide Gamers they're also the ones that developed the erc1155 token standard but going back to Affinity it's a polka dot parachain,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
tQys0pCILzM,and they want to make nfts accessible to everyone and they want to do that with low fees and cross-chain interoperability their paratoken standard accepts all tokens from other chains and they have prominent backers and have raised 38.9 million dollars EFI has been pretty volatile lately here's a snapshot of where we stand at the time of this recording it is up 10.7 percent in these last 24 hours currently sitting at 11.3 cents with a market cap of only 62.9 million dollars this is still a baby the max Supply is 2 billion tokens of which we have 26 or 518 million circulating this is a little bit further down on the list here number 352 among the crypto rankings that's according to coing gecko.com so this is a relatively smaller cap entry in our list which means it's extremely high potential a few months ago we did a dedicated video on enj and EFI the price of both if you're an Enthusiast and you think that this has as much potential and as high as ceiling as we do you're going to want to go back and check out this video from April foreign,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
tQys0pCILzM,[Music] and finally coin number five on our list here of great altcoin projects priced below one dollar we saved this spot for Moonbeam ticker g l m r this is really actually an all-time favorite of mine and back in February of this year we did a dedicated video about Moonbeam you can find the link here that's popping up on screen they also build on the polka dot parachain like affinity and the project started back in January of 2020 and two years later they launched on polka dot Moonbeam effectively is all about multi-chain,overall_free_search.csv,1.0
tQys0pCILzM,and they are also by the way evm compatible they were one of the first projects actually to get a pair of chain and as a result they have a very solid ecosystem this month they've been extremely busy for example the rare same nft Marketplace launched Cask protocol was successfully integrated Omni C launched that's their nft launch pad and Wormhole announced their launch on Moonbeam and keeping mind this isn't even an exhaustive list currently there's a lot of good momentum going on for Moonbeam and as you can see there are lots of Partnerships and Integrations happening glmr is the token they're up a little bit more modestly than some of the other entries on our list with the current price of 48 cents at the time of this recording their market cap sits at 200 million dollars now the max Supply is also infinite and there's a circulating Supply currently of 395 million out of 1 billion total Supply they are listed at number 159 according to coinggecko.com and by the way if you're holding glimmer you can get a 32.8 percent return if you lock your glmr for up to 120 days even if you choose to lock it for only 90 days that still returns you 19.6 so if you're holding that token on binance and you're not planning to actively play around with it in any way you may as well lock it up and stake it because those are fantastic rates so if if you're looking for that 100x crypto return at this exact moment I'm not going to promise you that I'm not going to lie to you guys but I do strongly recommend that while we're in this bear Market you check out some of these undervalued layer ones and layer twos that have massive goals and Ambitions and are building actively during this bear Market in order to achieve them next you should look at the crypto projects that are getting attention from really big investors and I'm happy to say that all of our entries on this list are getting that attention these kinds of projects are undervalued right now they're doing great work they're only being dragged down by the rest of this absurd bear Market at this point and they are poised to blow up in the next crypto Bull Run so among these entries that we talked about today let us know in the comments below which one is your favorite which best altcoins under a dollar have we potentially left off this list let me know guys of course best of luck if you choose to invest but never official Financial or investment advice you know that if you're still watching hey you're awesome be sure to like subscribe share hit the Bell to receive notification guys check out these videos here to my left to my right for similar content have a great Monday a great start to your week members of the altcoin buzz Army stay safe and as always and genuinely hope to see you again soon in our next video take care,overall_free_search.csv,1.0

U6KKBi-b3u8, have you heard about ethereum it's a blockchain-based platform that is changing the financial world as we know it in this video we'll explain what ethereum is how it works and why it matters ethereum is a decentralized network that is based on blockchain technology just like Bitcoin but while Bitcoin is used primarily as a digital currency ethereum is much more than that it's a platform for building decentralized applications or apps that run on blockchain technology one of the key features of ethereum is its smart contract functionality smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code once the conditions are met the contract is automatically executed without the need for any intermediaries this can be incredibly useful for various applications from Financial transactions to Supply Chain management to voting systems smart contracts can help to reduce costs and increase efficiency by removing intermediaries and automating processes but what about the cryptocurrency that powers ethereum that's called ether and it's used to pay for transactions and execute smart contracts ether is similar to bitcoin,overall_free_search.csv,0.0
U6KKBi-b3u8,but it's designed specifically for use on the ethereum network in order to use ethereum you'll need to have some ether you can buy ether on cryptocurrency exchanges or earn it by mining once you have ether you can use it to pay for transactions on the network and execute smart contracts one of the challenges of blockchain technology is scalability as more people use the network it can become slower and more expensive to use but ethereum is working on a solution to this problem called ethereum 2.0 which will move the network from a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake algorithm this will make the network faster more secure and more scalable allowing it to handle more transactions and accommodate more users so why does ethereum matter because it has the potential to change the way we think about finance and Technology by providing a platform for decentralized applications ethereum is democratizing access to financial services and online Mercury [Music],overall_free_search.csv,0.0

P8upKEsCyU4,so thank you guys so much and now with that said let's begin alright so before we talk about the best upcoming opportunities you first need to understand what you're going to be up against and to start we need to talk about a recession generally recessions are accompanied by a significant rise in unemployment a drop in wages a loss in consumer confidence and a decline in values across everything from stocks food energy and services with sometimes long lasting effects throughout the entire world but second along with the recession usually comes a decline in earnings see every quarter companies report the revenue and give guidance on their future outlook but lately they've been cutting forecasts bracing for slow or even negative growth inciting recession risks at the highest Pace in 10 years that leads us to third layoffs when consumers earn less they spend less and when companies see less demand they begin to scale back on their expenses with usually employees being the first to get let go in fact just a quick Google search for Mass layoffs shows you dozens upon dozens of companies who are are all trimming their Workforce and as Bank of America explains the U.S economy will soon start losing 175 000 jobs per month so in terms of what this means for you and your Investments as well as how you could use this information to make you money let's start here with number one stocks as of now all three major indexes are down between 20 and 30 percent with analysts like JP Morgan who believe that we have another 20 to go from current levels however if we take a look throughout history since 1946 the average bear Market drop was close to 30 percent with the most severe having been in 2009 when the S&P500 fell 57 from the peak now once you combine the average with the recession bear markets tend to do even worse with an average drop of 34.8 percent which just for reference right now we're down about 25 all of that is to say that generally the absolute bottom occurs when we see capitulation across investors usually that's a time of the start of the recovery and things begin to bounce back now I'll cover exactly how much you can make from this in the next few minutes but first we we have to talk about number two real estate even though every area is different and some locations might continue to flourish housing declines on a national level are actually incredibly rare in fact as you can see throughout the last 60 years there have only ever been a few times where prices meaningfully fell more than 10 percent but now the general Wall Street consensus is that National housing prices are going to decline seven percent with a worst case decline of 10 to 15 percent should interest rates continue to increase of course every Market is going to be different and according to Moody's Analytics the most vulnerable markets could see upwards of a 25 decline from the peak including parts of Florida Arizona Idaho and Southern California with the decline lasting another 12 to 18 months before bottoming out now in the big picture it's probably not going to make that big of a difference for anybody with a fixed rate mortgage who intends to stay in their property for another five to ten years but for anyone looking to invest or buy a house we may begin to see some deals starting to come on the market which we'll cover shortly because we have to also talk about third cash clearly up until now there's been this mindset that cash is wasting away to inflation but when every other asset is falling in price sometimes cash could be the safest place to store your wealth and you know that's significant when someone like the billionaire Ray dalio admits that cash is no longer trash the truth is many people forget that as recent as 2018 cash was the best performing asset and had you just been saving your money in a high-yield savings account you would have far outpaced the market cash is now becoming such a significant part of the portfolio that even fund managers are holding on to the highest amount of cash since 2001 and Citigroup said that cash is the only asset that investors could use as a recession hatch but as far as what you could do about this to make money and why so many people never take advantage of what's about to come here's what you need to know all right so in terms of why this next recession could be a once in a generation opportunity just to consider this first everything becomes less expensive the way I see it even though one person might think this is a bad time to invest everything is falling 30 percent a wealthy person would see this as an opportunity to be able to buy those exact same companies for a 30 discount Warren Buffett really had the perfect analogy for this he said when hamburger prices go down in price we sing when hamburgers go up in price we weep for most people it's the same thing with everything in life that they're buying except for stocks when stocks go down and you can get more for your money people don't like them anymore so first reframe your belief because a falling Market could work to your advantage the second there's less competition the fact is when times are difficult companies scale back they fold they can serve cash and they play it safe but this opens the door for smaller more aggressive companies to stand out and take their place for example one study across 16 000 companies found that those who continue to advertise increase their value and got more bang for the buck with Positive Growth years after the recession ended the third there's way more opportunity in a way a recession is the Market's method of weeding out the week and Patrick met David made a fantastic comparison a few months ago that the peak of the market cycle is exactly like a forest this means that only the largest most established trees or companies get access to all the resources or in this case sunlight everything at the bottom has a difficult time being able to compete and it's hard to grow but just like natural forest fires our economy has a way of repeatedly clearing out and bankrupting the companies who no longer are able to sustain themselves giving opportunities for newer smaller businesses to continue to develop and fourth after every bear Market comes a bull market as Yahoo finance points out historically the S&P500 has fallen an average of 29 around a recession with a median drop of 24 but once stocks have found their low their average return the following year is 40 percent and within two years the market has increased an average of 58 percent this means that investing in the way down is much more profitable than pulling out of the market and waiting and long term the market is always recovered in every single example so far throughout history and finally fifth you have to act before anyone else knows about it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

portfolio that even fund managers are holding on to the highest amount of cash since 2001 and Citigroup said that cash is the only asset that investors could use as a recession hatch but as far as what you could do about this to make money and why so many people never take advantage of what's about to come here's what you need to know all right so in terms of why this next recession could be a once in a generation opportunity just to consider this first everything becomes less expensive the way I see it even though one person might think this is a bad time to invest everything is falling 30 percent a wealthy person would see this as an opportunity to be able to buy those exact same companies for a 30 discount Warren Buffett really had the perfect analogy for this he said when hamburger prices go down in price we sing when hamburgers go up in price we weep for most people it's the same thing with everything in life that they're buying except for stocks when stocks go down and you can get more for your money people don't like them anymore so first reframe your belief because a falling Market could work to your advantage the second there's less competition the fact is when times are difficult companies scale back they fold they can serve cash and they play it safe but this opens the door for smaller more aggressive companies to stand out and take their place for example one study across 16 000 companies found that those who continue to advertise increase their value and got more bang for the buck with Positive Growth years after the recession ended the third there's way more opportunity in a way a recession is the Market's method of weeding out the week and Patrick met David made a fantastic comparison a few months ago that the peak of the market cycle is exactly like a forest this means that only the largest most established trees or companies get access to all the resources or in this case sunlight everything at the bottom has a difficult time being able to compete and it's hard to grow but just like natural forest fires our economy has a way of repeatedly clearing out and bankrupting the companies who no longer are able to sustain themselves giving opportunities for newer smaller businesses to continue to develop and fourth after every bear Market comes a bull market as Yahoo finance points out historically the S&P500 has fallen an average of 29 around a recession with a median drop of 24 but once stocks have found their low their average return the following year is 40 percent and within two years the market has increased an average of 58 percent this means that investing in the way down is much more profitable than pulling out of the market and waiting and long term the market is always recovered in every single example so far throughout history and finally fifth you have to act before anyone else knows about it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

3irypwLDtTs, folks in today's video I have a new top trade idea that I believe has substantial upside potential now I think that as I present the stock you may be inclined to be like no that's a stupid trade idea but I think there's really a big play here and I want you to just watch the entire video before you click off before you think okay maybe I don't agree with him just hear out all of my points because I think this is one of the most fascinating setups that we've seen probably in the last six to 12 months we have a stock today that is trading at about 13 cents that I believe could very easily get to 43 cents 45 cents just completely blow through a lot of the previous resistance levels that it failed to break and folks look I see a lot of Rally rallito or Sergey mcsurgey potential here but I've been wrong many times in the past we'll be wrong many times in the future my job here on this channel and my intention is just to present you with my research and why I like the setup,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,but you have to be the ultimate judge you're the one taking the risk so you got to be the one doing the ultimate Frisk I promise I'm going to stop with that a catchphrase very soon I gotta come up with another one if you have another catchphrase for me comment down below handful disclosure I own zero shares of this my goal with this video is to present research that is hopefully going to age very well and encourage you to keep coming back to us for more in the future that's the business model of zip Trader okay so the ticker that we're going to be talking about today is brds and this is a very important time to talk about her because she has just concluded her first massive spiky spiky that threw her to just under 25 cents and now she's been in a very very aggressive take profit cycle that I believe is about to conclude,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
3irypwLDtTs,and I believe was artificially created by massive massive dumping of shares in fact I don't just believe that but the short data the short data backs that up you have massive massive Short Selling here bringing the price down and it's been very very successful and if it's allowed to have its way it's probably going to push it down to zero but I think but I think that this is actually going to bottom a lot sooner I think it's going to bottom and cause a lot a lot of Ricochet effects this is the company that makes the bird scooters and electric bikes that plague the street streets of many major cities in the U.S and my first instinct too is what a damn boringly simple and kind of stupid business model that's very easy for competitors to compete against and just rise up against sure bird is popular and well known but it's not exactly the sexiest sounding play in fact a lot of times I have a little bit of a vendetta against them because a lot of their Riders will go and ride in the middle of the damn road,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
3irypwLDtTs,and I'm trying to drive my car and you got this guy over there on his damn scooter I'm like buddy hey pal get over and he's like no I got a scooter it's like these people have never heard of a sidewalk but nonetheless there are a lot of reasons that you should pay attention to the stock the first reason is that insiders are buying like crazy bird announced purchases of shares by management and directors totaling over 1.5 million shares purchased you had two officers and one director buying a substantial number of shares eighty thousand one million 320 000 200 000 which total about 1.5 million and they bought all of these in the last couple of weeks here in March and they bought them at a price that is usually around 12 to 13 which is about at the price that we're trading at currently give or take a few cents which means that not only do insiders think the company is worth buying at the current price,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,but when this was widely reported the price actually nearly doubled so speculators and Traders went and heard about insiders buying the company and they doubled the price but now that that attention is washed away it's gone back down which has allowed it to get back to the price that these insiders had bought at originally now you and I both know that insiders can and often are morons and they buy their stocks at really really elevated prizes a lot of the time but,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,but and this is very very key here there's a certain level of confidence in a stock when insiders are buying instead of just dumping everything however now the price is back to the point where they bought it at which means markets know they can buy in at what the management thought was fair number two the company is in a very solid liquidity position they have 33.4 million in cash and cash equivalents 4.9 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents 2.1 million in accounts receivable 1.5 million in inventory and 22.6 million in prepaid expenses which comes out to 64.8 million in total current assets but the entire market cap is only at 43 million and change,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,and then you go for a second and you add in restricted cash vehicle deposits Vehicles net and other assets and you're at 225 million and change in terms of total assets and if you want to go and net it out assets minus liabilities you're still in a very solid position something like 25 million bucks but what really matters here and why you want to pay attention to how much cash they have access to and how many assets they have the reason this really matters is because my two biggest fears in life are death and dilution and with death I mean ZIP Trader can always issue more Charlie's so dilution dilution is really the bigger threat here those of you who are new with this and those who watch us already know this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,but if you're playing with small cap stocks your biggest enemy is always going to be companies that are issuing more and more shares and diluting you up the Wazoo but they are much less likely to dilute if they are already in a solid cash position because it puts them at a disadvantage when they are issuing at such a low price they're in a very very strong cash position so they don't need to destroy shareholders,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,and and it's going to only work against them if they destroy shareholders so again in terms of dilution one of the best parts of the setup is you're probably not going to have it number three earnings came out and they were solid and the price reacted positively but it was suppressed very very quickly which I believe is an inefficiency on March 10th they put out a press release that their revenue had beat Expectations by 20.91 million their adjusted ebitda was 6.1 million their positive cash flow of 5 to 10 million and markets were originally very very thrilled the stock went on a journey from 10 cents to nearly 25 cents which was then accelerated by the positive news about Insider's buying but that entire that entire rally cycle has now almost completely evaporated for a company that reported something that's far above shareholder expectations and Market expectations and analyst expectations and a company that's seen insiders go and buy the stock well you put all this together and I would make a strong argument that this is trading artificially low,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
3irypwLDtTs,but the reason that this one is particularly interesting is because I believe that this is being suppressed Us by short Sellers and they are setting themselves up for massive massive Ricochet effects you open up the chart you have this level of spikability where the stock has these days where you get people trying to buy in they break through momentarily in the stock spikes dramatically,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,but then it gets crushed shortly after why again I'd argue a big reason is because shorts dump on them every single up day and they do it aggressively helping completely destroy any interest in the stock and then completely destroy any ability for it to get any sizable momentum any sort of momentum in the stock is completely crushed so that no form of morale can be built and cause the momentum to keep building and building and killing the shorts short interest had continued piling on and suppressing the move throughout most of the last six months but then earnings came out and these shorts did temporarily freak out and started covering but they are once again trying to throw the book and have help Drive the post earnings uptrend way back down so hey it started rallying a little bit shorts freaked out thinking they were going to get screwed and then all of a sudden they realized okay well now we can have a stronghold back on the stock we're going to go ahead and just dump we're going to dump faster than what happens after you eat at the Taco Bell,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,and so it looks like they dumped on this so aggressively that it just completely completely destroyed any and all momentum which look Kudos they were able to get the stock down and if they keep pushing it down to zero they're going to make tons of profits but they are working with the assumption that markets won't care about a bird rental company a little scooter rental company they're operating under the assumption that they could get away with this and convincing markets that this is going to go bankrupt even though they have very solid cash liquidity as I showed earlier and they think they could probably get this a lot closer to zero and remember folks when you have a small cap stock with a tight float well it doesn't take much doesn't take much buying to move that stock up a lot,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,and likewise it doesn't take much Short Selling much dumping of shares that you don't own for the stock to go down quite a lot too so every single little sizable run of buyers that caused a spike in the price were immediately immediately suppressed before they could attract any more attention and the one wave that caused more sustainable momentum was hit with Firepower that the stock had never even seen really before so the reason that I want to bring this dog to your attention is because shorts are looking at the stock and ignoring a lot of the fundamental strength that it has on its books and its balance sheet because they think again who the hell is going to care about a scooter rental company when banks are collapsing left and right so my thought process is if this can bottom out soon it's actually going to be incredibly ripe for a squeeze maybe one of the best in the small cap space right now it could quickly start seeing those previous resistance levels be broken,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
3irypwLDtTs,and I think you could see this break back above 18 25 27 and maybe even get back to those November Highs at about 45 cents obviously you're going to need to see proof of concept as it hits each level but I think that it's possible here if you get enough attention on the stock if you get enough people saying hey wait a second this company actually has a pretty strong liquidity situation maybe it's not worth zero dollars I think that brds is unique for all the reasons that we mentioned but also I think it's Unique because it has that Dynamic where a lot of people think of this business in a negative light they think of it kind of like your Bed Bath and Beyond your retail stores right your GameStop your AMC your red box so on and so forth these Party City type stocks that people think are very very toxic so they're not even willing to buy it so shorts can just completely have their way with the stock and they tend to not think about risk because they're like oh well the Market's already decided this is a garbage stock,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3irypwLDtTs,so I could just short it as much as possible and drive that price down like a dock but similar to those if enough people see this opportunity I think you're going to get a lot of squeezy mcqueezy and that could leave shorts open to severe severe pain for now what I'm looking at with this stock is what I said you want to see it bottom you want to see some proof of concept of the uptrend and you want to watch those resistance levels and by the way quick plug if you want to be the first to see our top ideas make sure to check out zip Trader you link down below we posted brds today at about 32 minutes prior to Market close,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

SbMtY-aJjFA, where have I been putting my money this year in crypto what coins have I been buying and why and what are my plans for those Investments obviously I need to say before we start this video I own the coins that we're going to be talking about and as always you can find a full disclosure statement of all the coins that I own and all my Venture Capital investments in the description of the video also I am a fan of making money I buy things with the intention of selling them at some point news flash right also I'm not buying these today these are positions that I've either been consistently buying into over the previous weeks or months or have purchased in the last few weeks so let's do this let's talk about first off Bitcoin obviously Bitcoin plus drill a bit more into this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,right it's like this a little more interesting and juicy you see right now I believe we're at a interesting phase in the market we're at the start of a new market cycle cautiously optimistic here these are the very earliest phases of the bull market U.S recession fears could still weigh heavy on us later this year and at least slowest down or maybe derail us but so long as Bitcoin trades under 30k I'm interested in stacking Bitcoin they're over 30k probably gonna slow down or even stop buying Bitcoin with fresh cash at this point I will be looking for better Roi elsewhere and other coins Bitcoin next cycle looking at like 150k or something like that for a top and that's like a 5x was not bad but not insane for crypto right I will still acquire Bitcoin during that time when I stop putting fresh cash in I won't completely stop right because I do receive Bitcoin from things like affiliate programs and I of course move altcoin profits into Bitcoin so do keep that in mind,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,but I probably won't be putting any fresh cash into BTC I will watch it take some money off the table as well on a portion of my BTC stack when we are trading over a hundred K because why the heck not rough plan anyway now let's talk about Avalanche,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,so the avax token I've recently basically doubled my avax position buying in around 18 of the intent tension to flip it at around thirty dollars we'll see how that works out obviously my existing position the other half of my avax coins I'm aiming to hold a little bit longer right into the cycle but Apex I'm doing some pretty awesome things recently which made me take a big interest in taking that position we're seeing a big increase in Daily users we're seeing a big increase in developer activity the recent Evergreen subnet announcement that was also a really big deal that was basically the intention to allow institutions an easy path to be able to build blockchain infrastructure on an Avalanche subnet recent expansion moves by Avalanche I've also seen some some really big Partnerships we have big Japanese gaming partnership for example an entry into the South Korean market following a big data company partnership recent news also that Avalanche nailed down a partnership with alibaba's cloud service called cloudverse This is to allow Alibaba users to be able to create and then to be able to of course deploy blockchain based metaverses pretty cool right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,and was also announced last week that Avalanche and ethereum now have a new non-custodial Bridge solution for moving usdc back and forth across the chains thanks to a new tech Solution by usdc parent company sir can I look in my mind Avalanche is doing all the right things the question is will it be enough to matter considering the current market conditions obviously fingers crossed that it will the third coin is arbitrum first can I say that the ARB token is a useless governance token I know that I understand second let me say that this doesn't necessarily matter as much as some might like to think that it does it can still pump it can still make money there's lots of useless governance tokens like uni swap right,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,my thought process is basically this arm trims exploding it's doing more transactions than ethereum on most days it's seeing strong user growth is seeing strong engagement stats Builders are showing up to the arbitrary Network in a CIA serious way in many ways I feel like arbitrum is a blue chip quality piece of technology whose token is not currently trading at a Blue Chip Price this is one that I've been adding to weekly since it started trading on the open market I'll be looking to at least double my money on this that's kind of the intention of this arbitrim position now before I talk about the last coins let me just take a quick moment to tell you about my Weekly Newsletter it's called wealth Master you probably heard mention once or twice if this isn't your first time with the channel now if you're the kind of person who wants to find those money making opportunities in crypto you want to stay up to date with the latest of what's happening in this market and what it all means but you know you got the job you got the kids you got the wife you a life you want to try and live then this is the newsletter for you my team,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,and I spend about 40 hours every single week it's our job to do it right making this newsletter packed full of crypto Alpha for you that you can just read in about like 10 minutes sounds like a pretty good deal right join our 65 000 weekly readers and sign up for free for free using the link in the description now let's talk about the next coin and list here which is spool now this is actually one that I previously owned then capitulated on during the bear Market it happens I am now back on to the spool train making two new purchases in the last two weeks of this altcoin now this is a low cap altcoin right one that I think has high potential but also a riskier play so I'm not risking a giant amount of my Capital on it's like 0.3 percent or something in my portfolio right now so just a little little nibble right I think a 10x not out of the question here for this one at least that's what I'm thinking as a Target,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,but I'm also prepared to just you know lose my shirt on it if that's what the market decides right that's why I'm not risking a huge amount of money on it I really started paying attention to spool again once they expanded onto the arbitrary Network because I've been using the Arbitrage Network myself right and then they announced their V2 which also sparked a bit of Interest now spool has a focus on institutional defy adoption for their crypto native of yield strategies the app itself super easy to use basically deposits stable coins into risk adjusted pools you can decide you want to go high risk or low risk right and then sit back and wait for the money to roll in which is a pretty cool idea the spool token is a real yield coin with platform fees going largely to stakers now the next coin is one that is not something that I technically bought recently I invested at the pre-sale late last year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,but it's on my radar once again because right now they're doing their public node sale and the nodes are going to start making me money pretty soon so that's exciting miria so it's miria is the one by the way miria is a layer 2 ethereum Network purpose built for gaming already has some pretty impressive user stats million registered users we have more than 250 different games actually building on their Network the network offers a zero gas fee experience for users which of course is the friction that you need to get out of the way to make the game is fun to play 9 000 transactions per second along a zero feet nft minting so all the kind of right stuff that's really perfect for gaming right now the nodes that I bought let me earn Myriad tokens and or nfts for my work of helping to secure the network,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,personally I think layer 2 space is getting pretty damn crowded with consensus's new one and coinbase's new one and all the other new ones but for me the reason I bought the nodes was because I thought it could be a good bet on owning a piece of gaming infrastructure instead of trying to bet on a particular game because while there have been some pretty cool games that have made me some money sometimes a lot of others have also lost money a lot of games are trash that I invested in though they turned up being trash right they looked very promising at the start right so maybe owning nodes in a gaming ecosystem might be a better bet that pays off that's my thought process anyway and that's why I bought some area nodes and next let's talk about one that I have not bought yet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SbMtY-aJjFA,but I'm definitely keeping an eye on for a flip and that of course is the newest blockchain the new kid on the Block sui this fancy blockchain thing was built by some of the people who worked on Facebook's Novi before us Regulators came along and shut that down now sui is basically an Aptos sibling and both are supposedly Solana Killers now sui is fast at a theoretical 297 000 transactions per second but I don't so much care about that and I'm not sure the Market's super going to care about that at the moment either what I'm interested in is to watch this for a flip although I'm not biting at the current prices ideally I would like to see something like I don't know 50 cents maybe something like that depending on market conditions if I see it come down to that kind of price I might pull the trigger because I feel like the VCS the whales they're all going to run it up at some point anyway this one's on the watch list for now so waiting and watching for a tastier entry price okay that's it subscribe now see you next time,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

TMpULJwCLZk, welcome to bitboy crypto the people's channel home of the bitcoin the largest and greatest crypto community in all the interwebs my name has been no channel works harder to keep you in the know about crypto now today we're actually going to be continuing our series on our five investing philosophies once you guys are a new building there you go look at it hidden network uh we created network after bitboy crypto uh but hidden network is now like the parent company of all the different things that we do here so pretty good not too much going on on the inside yet other than the back rooms but we're going to be building that out here pretty soon so super excited about that so i thought i'd start the video out here uh now today we're going to be talking about our third investment philosophy now build a balanced portfolio that is the philosophy and i know we did these monday and tuesday last week and i said i was probably gonna do all five last week,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TMpULJwCLZk,but i just didn't think with all the stuff going on between russia and ukraine that it was the uh the proper time to continue with the investment philosophy videos uh now you know i mean still you know just as urgent of a matter but i do feel like you know at this point it's okay to continue on on this series so let's talk about building a balanced portfolio let's talk about what that consists of okay so number one the most important thing is practice proper diversification now a lot of people tell you you need to diversify your portfolio and that's 100 accurate you have to diversify a good range of coins for your portfolio is anywhere between 8 and 20 at the max you really don't want more than that we've got a lot more than that so we're actually looking at uh you know consolidating a lot of our holdings here pretty soon not that we want to give up on projects,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TMpULJwCLZk,but you know we just think you don't want every single coin out there you know if you do you're kind of you know shooting yourself in the foot a lot of people when it comes to diversification you know we we know that you don't want to have two coins or one coin a lot of people say oh you really believe in xrp why don't you go all in on xrp well nothing is guaranteed in crypto nothing is guaranteed that's why you want to have a wide assortment of coins a lot of people will go all in on one coin and they'll get burned when it doesn't move,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TMpULJwCLZk,and then eventually they'll just move to another coin and they'll you know usually sell in the red and buy in the green that's that's not good that's not what we want to be doing we want to be making smart decisions with our portfolios but on the other side of this you also don't want to over diversify which is the spot that we're in right now and a lot of it is because we've done videos on different coins and because that we haven't wanted to sell them because you know we do a video we don't want to get out of the coin because we feel like we have a responsibility uh but we haven't done any of those videos here in a long time so we are going to be consolidating uh our portfolio some stuff we don't want to give up on we're just going to move on to stuff that we you know kind of you know we talked about our second investment philosophy you know we're only going to invest in stuff that we believe in are going to be here for the long term so we're going to be moving out of a lot of different coins but you don't want to over diversify when you have 100 coins in your portfolio let's say you have a thousand uh a thousand uh dollars in each coin let's say you have a hundred coins it's a lot of money but let's just say one of them pumps you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TMpULJwCLZk,ten percent well okay you made 100 bucks let's say one of them pumps 500 okay now you've done pretty well now you've made you know 5 000 what about all the other coins that are just sitting there if you only had 20 coins that same pool of money in one of them pumps 500 now you've absolutely crushed it you've done extremely well so don't over diversify don't under diversify but also make sure you're diversifying across niches that's going to be really really important to do so next the next thing that we're going to want to make sure that we do when it comes to proper diversification and building a balanced portfolio is that you're definitely going to want to make sure and this is a very very very important that you're not getting married to your bags don't get married to your bags now what do we mean by that that means let's say you invest in a coin and it looks like it's going to do really well and you're super excited about it for the long term,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TMpULJwCLZk,well that's great however what if that project starts to go awry what if an important team member leaves like let's look at eos eos is a great example eos might have been in one of your you know your portfolios you might have liked a coin you might have thought it was going to do very well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TMpULJwCLZk,but then dan lammer the the cto and really the guy who created it and created many other projects before that he left well now that he left it could be a good sign maybe to get out of that coin so don't feel the need to stay in a coin for the sake of staying in the coin you're going to want to make sure that if a project is going in a certain direction and this this does not mean you know uh that you don't you know sell in the green and or and buying the red but what it does mean is sometimes you have to know when to give up sometimes you absolutely have to give up sometimes a project is just not going the direction you thought it would and you've got to move on now this doesn't mean you're moving on because you're bored with the price this is a big problem people have is they will get bored with the price and because that they'll move out of it well what changed with the project nothing if nothing changed with a project then that's a bad reason to get out because crypto punk uh crypto pumps are cyclical,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TMpULJwCLZk,okay so those are definitely two things that you have to do you have to practice proper diversification okay you have to also make sure that you're not getting married to your bags and number three probably the most the most important um of all of these is make sure you're mostly investing in top coins a lot of people have an issue where they want to come in they want to get 100 x alt coins now if you're a true degen that's all you care about then that's one thing but if you're building a portfolio for the long term you don't want to only be investing in small coins i suggest having anywhere between 25 to 50 of your portfolio into bitcoin okay if you're going smaller on the 25 side of things then you're gonna want at least 25 in ethereum you want fifty percent of your portfolio if not a little bit more to be bitcoin and ethereum why they've made it they've already made it they're here they are i don't consider ethereum in altcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TMpULJwCLZk,okay these are the two coins of the future that we know are going to be around virtually no matter what ethereum may be a little more risky because of each 2.0 we don't know exactly how that's going to work out but you don't need to be investing the majority of your portfolio into smaller coins okay you barely want to go out of the top 100 you barely actually want to go out of the top 20 to 50. so you're gonna want no more than five to ten percent of your portfolio invested in what i would call riskier assets or projects outside of the top 100 projects outside the top 50 you know you definitely don't want 15 percent of your portfolio in coin number 739 on coin market cap that's not going to really be a good strategy the people who have been around know that the gains are good enough with the top coins that's where the majority of your portfolio needs to be,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
TMpULJwCLZk,and i think that's where a lot of people have been confused when we've done videos on 100x altcoins or altcoin gems and things like that the fact is is that that needs to be a small percentage of portfolio and we've preached that and told that over and over again but people don't really seem to get that message and hold on to it so that's definitely something that you need to do so let's go over all these again number one use proper diversification of your portfolio number two don't get married to your bags and number three make sure you're investing the majority of your portfolio into top coins things that once again going back to our investing philosophy number two and one of those subsets you know investing in stuff that you believe in having a long-term mindset you're starting to see how all of our investment philosophies are really running into each other and how using these philosophies together is a very powerful tool to get the most out of your money all right guys that's all i got be blessed [Music] you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4PgIySbSm4g, thank you welcome to bitboy crypto my name is Ben I never thought I was gonna make this video guys look at that reflection look at the way that man holds the camera he's amazing that's me guys today we're going to talk about meme coins I don't talk to you guys about meme coins a lot why because I don't think they have any value I I don't think they're good and I'm certainly not going to say guarantee you to buy some okay you're never going to see me come into a chat come on to Twitter and say look at this meme coin this one's amazing no it's it's all height driven I do want to talk about meme coins because I'm going to talk about a different kind of philosophy that we're going to be uh we're gonna be using,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4PgIySbSm4g,and it's not only going to be mean coins but we're going to open up what we are going to call our Casino portfolio now why are we opening up this casino portfolio is because we're sponsored by stake and we love casinos it could be it actually could be we do love steak they are awesome thank you safe for being the main Channel sponsor of bitboy crypto um and if you guys want to check them out you guys can go to twitter.com check out my Twitter IO we do another fun giveaway with them here pretty soon so make sure to check it out let's go but the fact is is we're going to run this casino portfolio because I want to see the results okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4PgIySbSm4g,I you go back to the last market and we didn't I mean we bought some Dogecoin at like a penny sold it at seven cents bought it back at 20 cents sold it at 70 cents it's got some trades we made some trades based on hype which is whatever you can certainly do that um but in terms of having a portfolio we're going to sit on something through the through the bull market I just I want to see the kind of games these things are going to give like that's what I want to see and there's no way for me to really know it without experiencing it because listen to somebody else talk about how they became a millionaire in Chiba like that's cool I'm glad if people did it you guys know I don't like Sheba,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
4PgIySbSm4g,um I I was explaining that I don't like being coins however you look out of touch and like old man that yells at Bitcoin when you say that people can't make money with them so they do so we're going to experience that so we're gonna actually open up uh a portfolio that we are going to buy meme coins and even though this is not a meme coin I do feel like the gains were so massive last time and that uh you know I mean Richard Hart's a bit of a meme right which thing is a bit of a meme I don't mean that in a negative way I'm not saying that against Richard you guys know I like Richard um I'm saying it in like I mean you see what he how he dresses right he's more over over the top Than Me by a long shot right um so we're going to be putting a Dogecoin Sheba in HEX in that portfolio now what I want to I think here's what I want to do for the casino meme coin portfolio where you get the channel involved what we're going to do,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4PgIySbSm4g,is we're going to be bringing on um over this next year now these will not be sponsored anyway these will not be nobody's gonna be able to pay to come on the channel okay however we're going to be looking at several meme coins and we're gonna do maybe an interview with a founder and we're we're going to let the audience vote on whether we should add it to our portfolio or not and if more than 50 of our audience says we should add that one to a portfolio we will be adding that to the casino portfolio maybe five thousand dollars worth I'm not sure whatever whatever it might be so that's we're going to be doing I mean the ones that ones that I can think of uh I know we've been in touch with uh the uh founder of uh squid grow okay chip,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4PgIySbSm4g,Toshi we've been in touch with uh well I see these Suka guys all the time don't they're gonna they're gonna flip out when they see this they have no idea I'm saying this um but I'm sure they would probably like to come on the channel like we just it's very delicate because what I want to do is I want to be able to create a thin line okay a very narrow walkway with guard rails to where we're walking down this meme coin path and we're going to be adding them to our portfolio and we're going to be including the audience for engagement but we're not telling you to go buy these because they don't have utility like we're only doing it because we have an embarrassing an embarrassingly large amount of money and it's going to be good for us to be able to see this this will actually be what,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4PgIySbSm4g,what really is my thinking on this I know you guys think I'm going to retire next year it's not true um I want to see what kind of returns over this bull market that some of these mean coins are going to give so that way I have more research and understanding for the next Bull Run on how we should handle meme points for the next Bull Run because we just totally missed out on the last one and they were massive now maybe mean Queens don't even do well maybe a hexa store terrible maybe that will do terrible I I don't know maybe they will if it's okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4PgIySbSm4g,I'm okay losing all the money this this difference between me and what some of you might do if you put money as your investments into these meme points it doesn't matter if I lose all the money it does matter if you lose all the money so do the research and figure out if there's a percentage of your portfolio that you would like to allocate to fund things whether it's nfts or memes or hex or whatever it is right if that's stuff that you want to do but don't be putting them into keep the majority of your Investments 90 in major coins in the top 100. most of that should be in the top 10 to 20 okay so I just want to make sure we're getting the message straight let me explain what we're going to do because I think it's going to be cool information for the channel so let me know what you guys think about that thing or sponsor stake as always uh you guys can check them out on Twitter um that's all I got be blessed I'm gonna try to go find some FDT in the Bahamas oh yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

GjSG-dk4m8c, it's pump season profits are coming your way but how do you take profits well you start by moving your profits to stable coins but that's not where you stop what if you need to turn those stable coins into fiat so you can pay bills get out of debt or buy a lambo what then well you need to use a fiat off-ramp something to convert tokens to money in your traditional bank account and that isn't as easy as it sounds,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
GjSG-dk4m8c,let's get it welcome to bitboy crypto home of the bit squad the largest crypto community on all the interwebs my name is ben every day on this channel i show you how to make money in crypto if you like money and crypto then make sure to hit that subscribe button in this video we take a look at stable coins assets that are pegged to a fiat currency be it with actual units of that currency an asset that has the same value as the fiat currency or a combination of those two and some other assets it's growing technology that is traditional finance scared to death back in the olden days of crypto you used stable coins to buy crypto it was faster than banks and was available 24 7.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
GjSG-dk4m8c,nowadays stable coins have become their own sort of defy ecosystem with staking and lending offering fantastic returns compared to investments like a 401k tether of course was the first stablecoin you traded in one dollar and you got one tether back it was that simple kind of tether has had its problems with the stable coins ecosystem has gotten very sophisticated in the last three years coins like pax dollar die true usd and more have been adopted along with major coins like usdc and binance usd but the tail of the tape with stable coins is going to be the network they're on and the ease that they can be converted so you've been a wise degen and your bags are now full you want to start taking profits so you go to your exchange and start swapping for tether right not so fast the off-ramp you choose is important you need to make sure the exchange or service you're using is approved by country state or the province that your bank is in if you try to move money using a service that hasn't passed the regulations required to exchange funds then you could run into some serious troubles check the help or faq section of the exchange website to see where they have set up relationships and gotten approval for money transfers this is the first step when taking profits we use gemiini for an example they have a whole page that lays out their availability by country and state keep in mind if your bank is in australia a country that is open to gemini,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
GjSG-dk4m8c,but you are on vacation in morocco a country that isn't you'll need to use a vpn to do your business you can find one on bitboycrypto.com deals but morocco why are you so anti-crypto that's the serious question anyone from around the world is able to join the bit squad just by smashing that like and subscribe button that puts you in the best crypto community on the interwebs keeps you in the loop in the latest in crypto news and opinions but now that you've found the right exchange that can move money to and fro the stable coin you choose can make a world of difference when it comes to avoiding fees don't just default to tether if the exchange has its own stable coin like finance usd or gemini dollar you'll want to use that instead of picking a stable coin willy nilly here is what you have to keep in mind if you're moving around money on an ethereum based erc 20 token you're going to get walloped with bees with gray at all-time highs with no signs of letting up this can seriously take a buy out of your gains move your coins into stable coins that have the lowest transaction fees usually anything other than erc 20.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
GjSG-dk4m8c,you can do this by changing the default network that you are transferring to for example tether defaults to erc20,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
GjSG-dk4m8c,but you can choose to move your tether on the tron network which is a way better value it's worth mentioning that there are other networks and services that provide off-ramping transfer services like moonpay for simplex allow you to turn crypto into fiat for your bank but bitboy crypto hasn't used them very often so we can't recommend them to you comment below with your experience with these services and let us know how it went we use all sorts of exchanges to swap trade and buy tokens but at the end of the day when it's time to buy a lambo we use either coinbase or gemini to turn crypto profits into fiat we have an established relationship with these companies and have been doing transfers for a while but it wasn't always sunshine and rainbows there were speed bumps along the way so before you go and transfer thousands tens of thousands or millions of dollars in a stable coin to your bank do a few test transfers first usually banks aren't that concerned about money coming into your account so the likelihood of your account getting locked or the transaction bouncing is low,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

AaNfHskwLdg, understanding crypto is like having an aha moment when oprah winfrey coined the term on her show aha moments were usually about self-care or finding yourself but all aha moments boil down to this an important idea making sense all at once when we finally get crypto we see it can solve so many problems in the current financial system how blockchain can organize and decentralize the internet in ways we've never seen before my name is ben and in this video we're answering the question what is crypto let's get it to understand what cryptocurrency is first we have to look at what currency is a currency is a form of money issued by a central authority the value of currency used to be backed by the material used to make the currency in roman times coins were made out of four grams of silver the first watering down of roman money reduced the purity to 3.8 grams and the silver content in the currency continued to decline as new emperors came in and started cutting costs united states currency was backed by the gold standard until 1971.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
AaNfHskwLdg,before then the u.s dollar could be converted to an equal amount of gold fiat money is government-issued currency that's backed not by real-world assets but by the government that issued it paper bills have serial numbers that can be tracked by a central bank but most of the money you supply today is credit money electronic entries and financial ledgers that are managed by central banks gone are the days of carrying cash for everything our transactions are almost entirely digital now today the value of fiat is backed by collective trust in the government and considering the track record of most governments in the inflation and money printing we've seen recently let's just say it's a good thing we have a decentralized currency alternative cryptocurrency operates in a similar way to modern digital money but instead of being centrally validated by banks and other intermediaries cryptocurrency transactions are validated by a worldwide network of computers that don't operate under one central authority this is why we call them decentralized so if cryptocurrency is an alternative to fiat currency then why do we need so many of them as of june of 2022 there's almost 20 000 crypto projects registered on coin market cap one reason there are so many crypto currencies,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
AaNfHskwLdg,is that many crypto projects aren't created to be currencies at all they're blockchain projects making use of blockchain technology for other applications or creating solutions via the blockchain that's why i don't even call crypto projects cryptocurrency on my channel i call them crypto assets although most cryptocoins can be sent and theoretically used as payment many of them are purpose built to pay for activity on the blockchain in fact they would be inefficient and expensive to use as currency crypto assets are kind of like a swiss army knife of digital ownership it can be used in a variety of different ways to offer solutions and services to users much like a business while bitcoin was created specifically to be a decentralized currency other cryptos like chain link flow or ethereum were created to serve as a blockchain highway that other projects could be built on for example decentralized finance platforms nft marketplaces decentralized autonomous organizations or dows decentralized social media web3 gaming metaverse applications even ride sharing services operate on ethereum some blockchains were created to rival ethereum avalanche cardano finance smart chain and solana strive to be competitors of the ethereum blockchain that's why you may hear the term ethereum killers other blockchains were specifically built not to do everything ethereum can do for example theta blockchain is a purpose-built decentralized video delivery network decentraland is a token that supports a decentralized metaverse xrp is a payment settlement system that can process transactions globally projects that were built specifically to be currencies include bitcoin litecoin dogecoin and dollar peg stable coins like circles usdc and tethers usdt there are also privacy cryptocurrencies like monero and zcash to make transactions private and hard to trace for the sake of anonymity the internet created borderless global collaboration like we've never seen before blockchain is a way to put this collaboration on a ledger decentralizing data and making things more efficient for years technologists have been looking for a way to decentralize web services so they can't be influenced by any one person company or agenda they were the cypherpunks and we owe a lot of blockchains development to their commitment to making the internet as democratic and open as possible summed up best in the cyberpunk's manifesto by eric hughes he said privacy is necessary for an open society and electronic age we cannot expect governments corporations or other large faceless organizations to grant us privacy we must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any cyberpunks write code we know that someone has the right software to defend privacy and we're going to write it so is cryptocurrency,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
AaNfHskwLdg,safe well the short answer is that depends with any type of investment risk and returns depend on what you are willing to expose yourself to crypto is not just a new asset class entirely but a bleeding edge technology so that brings a level of risk with it as it stands the technology is still maturing,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
AaNfHskwLdg,but it's been proven enough for the world's largest investment firms to start accumulating tokens and coins as far as the security of the actual tech is concerned i'll break it down it's true that some blockchain networks prioritize speed over security and there are always hackers trying to alter blockchain code to try and make more tokens the good news is that the more prominent blockchain networks have been tested by hackers because they're almost always under attack the more computers a blockchain has validating its transactions the more secure a network is a 51 attack happens when more than 50 percent of the computers in a network are hacked or controlled by a group of miners or validators with bad intentions they can prevent transactions halt payments and reverse transactions allowing coins to be double spent now we've been talking a lot about blocks and chains and other tech stuff so now is a good time to explain just what the heck a blockchain actually is at its core a blockchain is just a fancy spreadsheet in the cryptoverse we call this a ledger the ledgers are cut up into chunks or blocks and these blocks are chained together in one giant file called a blockchain the giant blockchain of spreadsheets gets authenticated and verified so there aren't any double spins or other errors this is called consensus and it's a big part of what makes crypto so special consensus means computers are validating transactions and agreeing that the information is correct the two most common ways of achieving consensus in a blockchain are what's called proof of work and proof of stake bitcoin is a proof of work blockchain where specialized computers compete to solve complex math problems and are rewarded with bitcoin we call this mining the more people competing to solve blocks the more secure the network is new miners are incentivized to join the network as the value of bitcoin increases thereby making a positive feedback loop of network security of stake blockchains like cardano avalanche and polkadot are more scalable because they don't require expensive mining equipment or energy inputs like proof-of-work think of proof-of-stake like depositing coins into the crypto equivalent of a piggy bank users can store their tokens into one big piggy bank with other people and they're called delegators the person who keeps the electronic piggy bank up and running is called a validator the token protocol has rules that randomly select validators to add transactions to the blockchain which earns rewards that are shared by everyone who has stored their tokens in that validator so because major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum have so many computers validating the network or so much hash power it is extremely unlikely that they will suffer an attack they're just too many computers or a bad actor to control networks that suffered 51 percent attacks are mostly dead projects that have fewer nodes to validate transactions we've covered what cryptocurrency is and whether it's a safe place to invest money but what gives cryptocurrency its value well value can either be innate or acquired valuables like artwork gold or any other asset have innate value because they're scarce an acquired value is something like trust in a country's government like for the dollar or the yen but ultimately it doesn't matter why people want something it only matters that enough people want it in the case of crypto limited supply of certain projects coins can make holding the asset more desirable simple supply and demand there's also the key element of what the asset can do that creates value many crypto tokens have utility that gives access to platforms they can give holders the ability to trade and create opportunities for wealth building make decentralized payments and easy peer-to-peer transactions or act as a long-term store value speculators also believe that crypto assets will increase in price over time as their utility becomes more widely used so let's break down some of the different types of cryptos starting with the most valuable bitcoin created in 2009 by anonymous developers satoshi nakamoto bitcoin is the first digital currency designed to be a form of payment that doesn't require a middle man for financial transactions the first bitcoins were mined by home computers but as bitcoin mining became more competitive and mining rewards continued to be halved every four years asic miners became a more profitable way to mine bitcoin there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places smallest unit is called a satoshi after the creator buying small amounts of bitcoin is called stacking sats and can be one of the best ways to dollar cost average into bitcoin ethereum ethereum is a decentralized software platform powered by blockchain has a native cryptocurrency ether or eth that's used to pay for transaction fees making the price rise is ethereum games adoption the ethereum blockchain can be used to create and fund decentralized applications or dapps and other secure digital technology the ethereum blockchain's community ran and home to digital money global payments and applications right now the ethereum blockchain is proof of work and ether is mined the merge to ethereum 2.0 where ethereum will become proof of stake is expected to happen sometime in the summer or fall of 2022 crypto assets other than bitcoin are known as altcoins even ethereum although i would argue that ethan has become enough of a household name that it no longer deserves the label altcoin but all coins capture around 40 of the total crypto market cap as of today there are different types of altcoins with different use cases stable coins are cryptocurrency's bank account assets that are pegged to another asset like the us dollar stable coins are used for storing funds ramping fiat to crypto exchanges and trading crypto assets circles usdc and tethers usdt are examples of secure collateralized stablecoins that are backed by company assets and reserves utility tokens are a way to pay for blockchain functionality this means that ethereum's ether is a utility token along with cardano's ada governance tokens give holders voting rights for example uni is the governance token for the ethereum-based d5 platform uniswap security tokens are digital contracts that represent fractions of a real asset like a company recording ownership or stake meme coins are tokens that get their value from community buys and not fundamentals they're driven by hype and online communities privacy coins or cryptocurrencies that can hide blockchain transactions to create an anonymity,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
AaNfHskwLdg,so by now we know the basics of bitcoin ethereum and altcoins but what is d phi short for decentralized finance divide transactions are recorded and validated on a blockchain when two parties agree to exchange cryptocurrency this applies to payments securities trading insurance transactions lending and borrowing this is all happening outside of the traditional financial system but to do anything in crypto whether you're day trading loaning crypto or just buying pizza you'll need a crypto wallet a crypto wallet enables users to send and receive cryptocurrencies and is a central place to keep private keys crypto private keys are the cryptography number associated with a cryptocurrency that's similar to a password they prove ownership and signed transactions if you have the keys you own the crypto someone else gets access to the keys they can move your crypto i go into details on private keys in another video that you can find down below in the description so i've gone over a lot of the basics but you may be wondering why are crypto markets so volatile crypto markets are notorious for their volatility the price of crypto assets can increase and decrease dramatically more than almost any other asset we've seen in history main driver of crypto volatility are the bull and bear markets that follow bitcoin's four-year having cycles every four years the rewards for money bitcoin is cut in half disrupting the supply of bitcoin and renewing investor hype around the asset 2016 the price of bitcoin rose 7 thousand percent 2017 the price rose over two thousand percent now all-time highs were reached in 2017 and then again in 2021 when the price tripled from its previous all-time high like other assets news and speculation are responsible for price fluctuations between cycles but the extreme volatility seen in crypto is caused by having less liquidity after all as right now crypto doesn't have huge institutional investors in large trading firms holding giant amounts of assets,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
AaNfHskwLdg,yet but they're coming the price of all coins are directly affected by the price movements of bitcoin this is called bitcoin dominance if you zoom out the overall crypto market has trended upwards with major projects continuing to grow it's important to remember that not all crypto projects trend upward with some never returning to all-time highs many others disappearing altogether so some crypto projects die what should i buy well that all depends on your timeline and risk tolerance holding crypto over the long term can make big profits as long as the crypto you're holding is one that will be around continue increasing in value over the long term we are likely to continue seeing some of the big crypto projects in the long term bitcoin ethereum cardano binance coin xrp salon and polka dot are all within the top 20 projects based on market cap but not all projects stay on top in fact it's more of a revolving door doing research and staying connected to the latest in crypto news is a key part of making money in crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
AaNfHskwLdg,so if you want to stay in the loop on the latest in crypto news and education make sure to go ahead and hit that subscribe button and make sure to turn the bell on for notifications the best bet is to buy projects that have staying power the further you move down the list of highest cryptocap projects the riskier they become lower market caps mean it doesn't take much to pump the price but it doesn't take much to crash the price either it's also important not to confuse dollar value with market cap just because a coin seems cheap doesn't mean that it has a lot of room to grow a lower price token with a gigantic circulating supply can have a higher market cap than a higher priced asset with a smaller supply when researching crypto projects make stronger allocations of the top 10 or 20 market cap projects that you believe have staying power stick to the top 200 for speculative investments bear markets are catastrophic for altcoins so be aware of where we are in cryptocycles many people believe that the value of bitcoin and ethereum will increase over the long term so dollar cost averaging into these assets is a simple strategy that's proven to be a dependable way to gain exposure to an asset without trying to time dips in the market investing in cryptocurrency may seem complicated but once you get the fundamentals you can look at it just like any other asset class and decide for yourself if it works for your portfolio crypto isn't just a cash grab it's a new means of doing business in the digital economy it's money that exists outside of the traditional financial system crypto is a once in a millennium opportunity to be one of the first people to invest in an entirely new asset class comment below with any other crypto questions you may have smash that like button and don't forget to subscribe that's all i got be blessed goodbye out [Music] you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

4FJ9RXHKWgc,i'm going to be showing you guys the indicators how to load them and what were the ones i started with which are the correct ones to use and how to use them easily remember if you are new to this channel or you do have a free trading view account look to sign up a new account with the link in the description below look to make a new email as well as you do not want to confuse your trading world with your personal world and trading view is going to keep your emails quite busy remember by using this link it qualifies you for any trading view giveaways we give on the show as well as they are our partners and we're going to look at running massive specials for the banter community and thirdly obviously showing the love and the support for the actual channel now we're going to be dropping these educational videos every day as well as the shows to make sure that you hit the like you hit the subscribe button and the notification bell joining the best and baddest community on the planet and thirdly let's obviously blow up twitter,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4FJ9RXHKWgc,let's show them how excited we actually are for this new journey look to create or to change your name from your name and add this sniper to the end let's show twitter how excited we are and show how many snipers are actually out there no more wasting time let's get into it right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4FJ9RXHKWgc,so what are trading indicators these are tools added to our charts to help it simplify it and make it easy for us to understand they give us the stats and the mathematical calculations using data bypass and volume represented graphically now why do we need them because these help us understand understand trends they give us information about whether a coin is overbought or oversold which is one of the most important things you can learn with charting you need to understand where are you buying the coin in the emotional cycle they also help us indicate the possibility of price reversal to the up all the downward side now let's have a look at the positive and negatives positives they simplify the reading of charts and trends they help us predict the tops and the bottoms when the trend is changing either to the upside or the downside should i be buying is it starting to weaken should i start laddering out and start reducing my my position and they help us detect subtle changes in the markets now what are the negatives majority of the indicators are lagging indicators so these give you information and data on things that have already happened so if you don't know how to use them correctly you're actually working very far behind and you're not using them in the most accurate way now sometimes our child can become very cluttered and we think the more indicators we need we need the better traders we're going to be that's the complete wrong decision to actually you know we need to keep it as simple as possible using less and more accurate is way better and as you progress as a trader you'll see your indicators will reduce one by one all these indicators do have positives and negatives and they can give conflicting signals to other indicators so if you don't understand that some of them are the same some of them show more or less the same thing you know you can end up having one indicator telling you to buy one telling you to sell and it just creates a big confusion in your head and remember these cannot be used to predict the exact next movement in the actual market they're just little tools you have to use this with all your strategies and your normal knowledge to make actual decision they're never going to give you everything perfectly and set up simple right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4FJ9RXHKWgc,let's get in how we actually use these indicators [Music] right so let's jump on the chart and let's see how to add these indicators so remember i have shown you guys the normal platform and how it works now what you want to be getting to is you want to be coming to this little fx section over here and you can see it says indicators and strategies and if you click on it over here you will see you have your my favorites column and this is where we're going to use where you can add all the favorite indicators that you want so it's easy to add and get them on and off of your actual charts what we want to do first is we want to be adding these four the first one is moving average and if we push m a you will see you'll have moving average you want to click the little star you want to add that to your favorites list the second one that we want is rsi and it's relative strength index you want to be adding your star over there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4FJ9RXHKWgc,and then we have the stochastic rsi as well i'm going to show you the difference between the two and how to be using them click the star there as well and the third one this one does usually come on the standard that come as the standard on charts is volume just make sure you do have it selected click the star over there as well and as you can see we then have the four all set up here now to add them to your actual chart because this is just a favorite list is you will click on let's say the moving average,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4FJ9RXHKWgc,and there we go you can see how the 20 is added now if you want the 50 you can then see over here as well if i change this to 50 50 we standardize we usually use as red same thing second line over there and i can add it and remember if i go back yet i want to add multiple ones you can see how now how i have two and if i want the 20 and the actual 50 i can add the 20 in here change the style get it to the green put it up over there and there we go we can see how we have the actual two now i like to standardize 20 green 50 red 100 blue and the 200 purple you can sort of change it up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4FJ9RXHKWgc,but that's usually the standards that i used like to use keeping it simple now that's how you add moving averages the second one that we want to be looking at is our relative strength index if you click on that it's quite simple let's get rid of these over here you can see how it adds up and it's this little funny thing with the lines sitting at the bottom i will be explaining on a lot more depth in next videos but that's how you add the rsi if you then have a look at the stochastic you click on the stochastic that will be adding the stochastic in over there so it's quite simple and as you can see you've got a little x tool here if you do want to delete them at any point and instead of me going back and having to search for it again i can just pop into my favorites and it's very easy for me to load and then the last one is the volume a lot of them do come standard,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4FJ9RXHKWgc,but there we go you can see and now you add in the actual volume so these are the ones i'm going to be going into fantastic strategies one by one and it's the starter kit for you to understand the indicators and we will diversify and move on a lot more as we go that's it that's simple add your indicators and customize those charts [Music] so that's it for this video remember to hit that like hit that subscribe button and remember if you are new to use the link below in the description and remember to blow up twitter i will see you all on the next video ready to blow your mind i will see you all shortly,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

KnoQdWZ_n18, you might have heard the old investing advice time in the market beats timing the market but what if you can have both well good news we are right now in the middle of what is likely one of the best buying opportunities for stocks for crypto for Bitcoin even for Real Estate right could we get better deals than right now in 2023 absolutely still lots of potential for Insanity in the macro scene in particular but prices are getting pretty juicy and it's interesting to be dollar cost averaging in during this time and I know that you probably want to wait until everything gets back to its all-time high to buy that's what most people do but I don't I like buying when it's cheap so what makes 2023 such a great buying opportunity well the market isn't as unpredictable as you might actually think and you don't actually need to focus on timing the exact bottom,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,right some people are waiting just like I'm just going to get only the exact buttons the only time I'm gonna buy right now we're in the middle of a bottoming process potentially for the markets and almost every asset class is down right now dramatically from their all-time highs stocks are down tech stocks are really really down Bitcoins down all coins down real estate's down watches are down cars are down fire sale isn't over yet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,either so it is worth taking some time to try to understand what is actually going on in the markets here and to learn where they're heading this means that we as investors can respond accordingly and of course try to make smarter investing decisions based on the information you see right now central banks are being rather predictable in what they're doing central banks have the tools that they can use to try to control the economy and to control financial markets through monetary and fiscal policy these Banks tend to over stimulate an economy in a bull market and on the way down they tend to over tighten an economy in a bear market now this is usually due to an over-reliance on Rock Bottom interest rates and of course quantitative easing sound familiar this is all the stuff that's been going on for the past few years with over a decade of quantitative easing and it's basically a two-year blow-off pandemic top from all the stimulus the market needed a bit of a reset we are in the middle of that reset right now there's an obvious correlation that we are seeing here between both increasing interest rates as well as taking money out of the supply and the falling prices of assets have been going on for about the last year now using this time to build your Investment Portfolio could end up being a pretty smart move if you fast forward two three four five six years and with every reset central banks tend to over tighten by increasing interest rates too hard too fast because all they have is a hammer and all they can see is Nails right and that can end up leading to recessions now we're still doing the recession dance are we in a recession are we not in recession is a recession coming when's the recession coming how bad is it going to be is going to be shallow is going to be the worst one ever in the history of humanity,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,soft Landing maybe we don't know we don't know how much more pain is yet to come for markets we do know there will come a time though when the Federal Reserve says that enough is enough and they're gonna have to change course that a pivot is going to happen so what are the stages of a Federal Reserve pivot it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,so we can watch out for this when it happens well there are three stages of a Fed pivot stage one of a Fed pivot is to slow down the pace of the interest rate increases this means that more rate hikes are going to come but smaller increases happen each time remember this has been the fastest cycle of interest rate hikes in 30 freaking years we saw the Federal Reserve begin to slow down the rate hikes back in December of 2022 then the FED chose to hike 0.5 percent rather than the previous 0.75 percent then again this week we saw the Federal Reserve slowing those interest rate hikes once again only raising by 0.25 percent meaning that we are getting closer to a terminal rate the rate hikes are slowing down the faster they slow the rate hikes the faster they end up moving on to stage two we could hopefully expect to see the last rate hikes around March or April of this year if that's what happens markets are going to like that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,right now this would put the bond Market's base case at a 60 chance of a recession coming another key thing that we are looking for during this particular time is for the central bank to change their sentiment right we can expect a change from being hawkish or conservative to dovish or more liberal in their policies hawkish is the word that we use to describe in a central bank basically has a priority to slow down the economy this is bearish for markets and dovish that's the word that we use to describe a central Bank whose priority is to get an economy growing again that is a bullish signal for the markets so it's during this entire bottoming process when rates are being raised up that you're likely to find great investment opportunities the kind of opportunities that you're probably going to look back on in five years time and go yeah that was that was a smart move hopefully anyway that's the idea,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,right so you had the courage to invest when no one else wanted to now before telling you about how you can make the most of this opportunity I just want to let you know about my weekly cryptocurrency investor newsletter it's called wealth Mastery is just jam-packed full of alpha we have Alpha on alt coins and airdrops and test Nets and nfts and step-by-step D5 tutorials showing you how to earn great yields in crypto market analysis and much more join our over 50 000 weekly readers by signing up for free using that link Down Below in the description so how can you make the most of this opportunity that we're seeing right now in the markets first of course need to understand that bear markets do not last forever they just don't even the worst ones they don't last forever,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,so it's important to take action and to make the most of it while it does actually last so you can start to do that by making a plan if you're not already dollar cost averaging into the markets on a regular basis then this is actually maybe one of the first things you like to consider doing something I've been doing I've been dollar cost averaging to my favorite stocks into Bitcoin right you can set up those regular payments into your investment account and just invest in the top stuff the Blue Chips right they may not have the biggest gains but they're going to have solid gains in a future bull market that's your Bitcoin that's your ethereum that's your S&P500 maybe individual stocks like apple and Microsoft whatever right the Blue Chip stuff they're large they're profitable companies or they're you know big brand name cryptocurrencies things that are big enough for busting off and profitable enough to survive really any kind of Market uncertainty that we may face in the future,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,and we'll probably provide decent returns in the long run as well as that blue chip you might want to get into your your pocket you might want to look at averaging into growth opportunities as well things that you think are going to do well in the next bull market maybe an allocate a smaller percentage of your portfolio to those riskier plays but that could be hot tech stocks new alt coins I've seen huge gains already in some of this stuff and we've discussed these money making alternative narratives here as well as in the newsletter but of course you have to plan for the worst and make sure that you have enough cash to be able to last out a prolonged bear Market it's a bit of a balancing act you want to be invested but you also want to make sure you're not completely invested have cash in case things go way worse than you think they are right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,The Next Step here as well could be to try and increase your income during this time you know make sure that you're looking for ways to earn as much as possible so you can invest as much as possible of course spend as little as possible during 2023.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,so if we're talking about just investing more well here's a few ideas that maybe get a few more bucks into your pocket and then you can get a few more bucks into the market negotiate a pay rise with your boss just ask for one you never know what'll happen maybe they'll give it to you right and remember if your pay rate increase is less than the annual inflation rate then you're actually getting a pay cut take gone some extra hours too if you have the capacity to do that obviously maybe even start a low-cost side hustle in your free time to try and top up your salary and the opportunities online for a side hustle are like ridiculous ridiculous so much might be made online take up odd jobs in the local community as well you know set a timeline get creative think on your feet see what you can pull together chances are there's a lot of ways that you can increase your opportunities to earn money now to invest during this bear Market to have a better life later and once you do start making more money don't let lifestyle creep into your life right if your income increases try not to let your expenses go up to remember you're making extra money in order to invest it to have a better future you want your expenses to remain the same or even go down slightly and then take that extra cash and put it into Investments also pay attention to the markets this is the year when you want to be dialed in to what the heck is happening in stock markets crypto markets real estate markets all that stuff,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,right we're seeing the data from the FED coming in we're seeing what they're basing their conclusions on that's inflation what's happening inflation very important what's happening the interest rates with GDP,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KnoQdWZ_n18,the labor markets right this is all factoring into what's going to happen economically right whether we're having a recession or not and all that stuff the stock market could continue to fall throughout this tightening cycle so you have to be very careful of that even though it's looking very bullish right now so keep an eye on what is happening in any sort of negative news stories can move things real fast in the same way that positive news stories have been also keep in mind the stock market doesn't typically bottom before a recession begins so if we do get a recession that is something very much to keep in mind and remember that if we are in that recession situation that when the interest rate Cuts do come during the recession that is when we're likely to see some real ShakeOut happen don't be afraid to stay invested during this time don't be afraid we dollar cost average during this time chances are if you zoom out a few years this will have been a fantastic time to be dollar cost averaging into some of your favorite assets,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

Af4cKK_T2F0, what are going to be the big money moving Trends in crypto in 2023 well here are my guesses and what I'll be keeping my eye on in 2023 first let's talk about layer twos this is a big and growing area in the crypto economy right now ethereum layer 2 arbitrum for example has risen to be the fourth biggest Chain by total value locked in D5 layer 2 optimism number seven well ahead of many other big chains like Solana and cardano the layer 2 proposition has been pretty damn clear and people are paying attention use all of your favorite ethereum applications using ethereum for gas fees and pay just a fraction of the cost of using the main chain we also have a whole bunch more layer twos coming up soon it's not just optimism and arbitrum although they've been dominating the conversation we have things like ZK sync polygons ZK evm we have other networks coming up like starkware,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Af4cKK_T2F0,well Stark was already out they're gonna be doing more stuff I fully expect that 2023 will see more money more users more Developers flocking to ethereum layer twos that's not to say the other layer ones aren't going to do anything in fact I think that one of the big trends to watch out for in 2023 just like in 2019 just like in 2020 is that we're going to be seeing a new class of the next big thing blockchains being boring we have chains like Aptos sui Celestia analog miria partisia they have the potential to be really big now by the way I own some of those as you can always see in my disclosures page in the description and most of these are not even trading on the market yet except for Aptos but these coins do have the potential to be the next Cycles big 100x gainers although as with Aptos we could still see some really cheap prices develop on this coin and others as they come into the market in 2023 yes money and users and developers are starting to take notice of these networks too,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Af4cKK_T2F0,but these I think will really only take off and bring those massive gains in once we see a flood of retail people coming back in definitely worth keeping an eye on over the next year if you want to catch the next Solana it could be one of those I just mentioned also when possible try to get the airdrops for these coins we talk about this all the time in the newsletter then of course we have gaming and I know the gaming has been particularly slaughtered in this bear Market we have had a glut of new games coming into the market when gaming was hot hot hot hot hot we had oversaturation not enough real games too many hope and dream companies not delivering enough real Tech but I still think that gaming has huge potential in slowly but surely we're getting some real quality,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Af4cKK_T2F0,[ __ ] starting to come out in the gaming space for example eluvium just released the beta for their game with 30 000 test players ready to take the plunge it looks beautiful genso Kishi just released their game at the end of November so it's finally happening collectible card game cross the ages has opened up for Early Access people are already checking it out playing it then we have a exciting looking games like Off the Grid coming up at some point in the future which has like District 9 director Neil blomkamp on board like there's some seriously cool stuff going on in the gaming space in crypto and again those companies are portfolio companies you can check that out in the description for disclosures but my guess is that we see gaming being a leading force in crypto in 2023 and Beyond which is why I remain pretty invested in the sector now let's talk about monkey pictures I know the nfts had a really crazy crazy time in 2020 two in 2021 and we had a lot of scammy crap coming out but basically that was like wave one for nfts and while Legacy collections like board apes and crypto punks probably gonna be sticking around for a long gosh darn time the truth is that we have barely scratched the surface of nft Technology it's not just about monkey profile pictures man or flipping the next mint to make a few bucks nfts or digital ownership digital art and all kinds of use cases can grow out of that there is a reason why every Big Brand is getting into nfts right now because they're the evolution of ownership online I think 2023 this is a whole new wave of nft innovation happening a whole new wave of nft creators and collectors coming in that doesn't necessarily mean prices are going to go super nuts especially in Legacy collections but we could see some pretty cool stuff happening in the Ft space so do keep paying attention and we could see of course some cool collections come up that might be worth grabbing now before telling you about the recession regulations and of course whether or not we are going to actually see a new high in 2023 or not I just want to let you know about my weekly crypto investor newsletter it's called wealth mastering it is just jam-packed full of alpha on altcoins airdrops nfts D5 tutorials market analysis you can join our 50 000 weekly readers by signing up for free using the link Down Below in the description now let's talk about the potential for recession basically everyone and their mom is calling for a recession right now and they're all saying that it's going to be super super bad man like really bad like so bad seriously bad probably not good one thing is abundantly transparent though be ready for Market turmoil in 2023 maybe we're lucky maybe the [ __ ] doesn't hit the fan,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Af4cKK_T2F0,but if you are prepared for it to hit the fan if you're wearing raincoat then at least you're gonna be ready for it if it does we should also expect crypto to follow right along with macro so it goes down the toilet don't expect crypto to have a breakout moment well equities are going to crap right now we need to see the Fed rate hikes stop might happen in March or April to be clear rates will be higher when that happens over five percent or more but unless something serious breaks then inflation soars again then the end of the rate hikes could be near,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Af4cKK_T2F0,so it's something to look forward to I suppose next let's talk about regulations they're going to continue to be a major story for crypto in 2023 just as they have been for the past few years in particular The Fallout from FTX continue to play out which will give Regulators a new reason to bring the hammer down on crypto now the latest iteration of this is the Warren Marshall Bill which brings back all of the worst proposals that the Crypt industry has been fighting for years told you they're gonna come back guys and they did they did specifically they're looking at kyc for wallets minor stakers and validators as well as forcing these businesses to get money transmitter licenses which means that if you're like a Staker Network you might need a money transmitter license and a kyc yourself it's crazy basically a huge attack on freedom and privacy in crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Af4cKK_T2F0,and that's just one of like a dozen bills and no they're not all bad just most of them unfortunately and finally no new highs in fact we could be in for some serious chaos in q1 if we actually see the mountain gox coins finally making their way into the market if we see Genesis having any more crazy stuff going on that being said I think there could be a nice big fat rally at some point in 2023 one big enough to trick us into all believing it's real the bull Market's back on it's finally here there's still hope of getting out of mom's basement,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Af4cKK_T2F0,but no that's exactly the moment when you start thinking that that's exactly the moment when the smart money is going to be exiting before the next big fat nasty plunge we probably won't see new highs for crypto really until 2024 after the Bitcoin having no new cycle tops until 2025 that's basing a course on the Bitcoin for your model as well as likely changes post recession and fed monetary policy seems to line up pretty well on this prediction I would love to be dead wrong and just run it back to all time highs ASAP but that's not the most likely scenario is it okay that's it subscribe now see you next time thank you [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?, in today's video i want to discuss with you one of the absolute most important topics in cryptocurrency and that is protecting your damn crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,so i'm going to share some really important security tips with you because guys this is magic internet money you have got to take your security damn damn seriously because there are people out there whose full-time job is trying to steal your crypto think about that all it takes is one mistake one screw up and all your crypto's gone like that this is one of the realities of being a crypto investor you're in charge of your security you have to maintain constant vigilance and knowing some of the tips that i've been going to share in this video i think can help you at least a little bit in achieving the goal of trying to have some of the best security practices that you can for your crypto my name's lark every day i make videos talking about cryptocurrency investing so if that's a topic that you want to learn some more about make sure you subscribe to the channel gently tap on the thumbs up button and of course click on the notification bell to know when i put out a new video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,so let's go ahead and get straight into this and look just a quick note this is actually something that i've just shared in wealth mastery that's the weekly investor report that i put out i think this topic's so damn important though that it deserved a video topic as well but if you do want to check out wealth mastery click on the link down below me here in the description every week we're just sharing all kinds of great tips as well as a deep dive on altcoin trending coin analysis air drops token sales step-by-step decentralized finance tutorials and much much more so definitely check it out it's a great value totally just value-patched newsletter for less than 10 bucks a week so check that out using the link down below in the description,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,but anyway let's let's go ahead and get into this this is a big topic so let's start off by talking about two factor authentication if you can use two-factor authentication on the application or the exchange or whatever it is that you're using do it do it absolutely do it and this includes your email address you may not know it but most popular email providers like gmail or hotmail they allow you to do two-factor authentication so you should do it absolutely this means that nobody can hack into your email account without having your two-factor authentication available this is an absolutely critical step it's actually saved me a couple of times because i've had my passwords leaked in data hacks before and the only thing that stopped those hackers from getting into my exchange accounts was two factor authentication it's an absolutely critical step for your crypto so please please please make sure that happens you can also use a hardware device as a two-factor authentication so this is something maybe not a lot of people know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,but you can actually use something like this which is a ubi key or you can use something like this which is a ledger hardware wallet now these are not that expensive devices they have two factor authentication apps in them for the ledger the yubikey is a two factor authentication hardware device so they're cheap they're reliable just honestly invest in something because it's very very important for keeping your crypto safe next let's talk about getting a good password so you can see the examples here one two three four five six seven eight nine that is a bad password that password is basically instantaneously hackable as well as something like password one that's also almost instantaneously um hackable by hackers,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,but then you have something like this bitcoin with you know k with coin capital letters signs numbers this would actually take thousands of years based on current computer power for a hacker to hack so please make sure that your passwords are really really good and of course never reuse passwords for important sites so your coinbase and your binance and whatever exchange accounts those should all have different unique and very strong passwords it may seem obvious but it's incredibly incredibly important you may also want to consider getting a password manager also make sure to that none of the applications or different things on your browser are capturing and recording your copy and paste so a clipboard manager that records everything not a good idea disaster waiting to happen so please be careful another area to keep in mind is your phone now many people use their phone as a two-factor authentication device,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,but you don't want to be receiving text messages as two-factor authentication again you want to be using something like a security device like this or a google authenticator but on your phone now something that happens very commonly particularly in the united states is sim swap attacking this is where a hacker calls up your phone company they continue calling until they find a service rep that doesn't care enough and basically they port your phone over to the hackers it happens all the times when so many high high-profile cases of people losing millions of dollars with cryptocurrencies because their phone company gave their phone they ported it over to hackers so if it is possible then set a pin on your account that makes it so that you need that pin in order to do anything like you know supporting your phone over right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,so or you can even get a um sim lock put in place or something like that with your phone company so call up your phone company explore those options make sure that you take that seriously because phones are one of those areas of crypto security that people kind of forget about but it's really really important next,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,let's talk about links so google there's so many phishing sites out there trying to steal your passphrase there's constantly fake apps and stuff like this popping up they want to infect your computer with malware they want to get keystroke loggers so they can copy your passwords when you type them in they want you to enter your passphrase into a scam website look here's how to access links you want to bookmark the link of your exchange so that you can always just go to your bookmarks tab and safely access a link that you know works so please please consider doing that you will also want to get the original link from a verified source now going to a verified twitter account of for example coinbase or binance is a good way to actually get signed up for those services so always make sure you're getting the official link because when you google coinbase for example the top five ads that come up are basically all scam websites trying to steal your money google youtube all these companies are massively asleep at the wheel on terms of policing the incredible amount of scamming going on so you have to take care of yourself don't rely on these companies who don't care about you to take care of you because they're not going to also be very careful about emails you're regularly going to receive emails saying that someone's hacked into your account maybe some other kind of crisis going on and you have to react right now because all your crypt is about to disappear click on this link enter your passphrase,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,it's all going to be okay nine to nine point nine percent of the time you receive these emails it's a scam so please don't click on those links you're gonna download malware or they're gonna ask you to put your passphrase in this crisis it's not real but if you think that there could have been something that happened or if you just want to check and make sure hey maybe that is a real email then you go to your bookmark you click on your bookmark you go to that website and you log in and you check the website that way you do not use the email or any links in an email that you receive please please keep that in mind also chrome extensions they can be dangerous back doors to again bring malware and stuff into your computer so unless you really really need that chrome extension get rid of it get rid of it if you don't need it get rid of it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,you'll probably have a lot of chrome extensions that are just not particularly useful so get rid of those because they are unnecessary back doors that could cause you a lot of trouble never download from strangers in the same way you don't want to take candy from a guy in an alleyway don't download files from your new friends on telegram or any other website there are so many people out there trying to scam you again there's entire teams of people who dedicate their entire days every single day to trying to rob you seriously so don't download anything from you know anybody basically online always go to official sources for downloads please keep that in mind you also need to be watching out for all the different scams you're gonna be approached online by people saying that they've got some magical mining thing where they're going to all you need to do is give them 10 ethereum and they're going to give you back 30 a week every week for the rest of your life in ethereum so you're going to be making thousands and thousands of dollars every week in passive income mining yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,that's a scam that's a scam you're gonna lose your money you also have companies that are gonna say they're gonna make five percent profits for you a day or some other ridiculous number like that by trading forex or you know trading crypto that's a scam that's a scam again you're getting scammed there's a pretty common one that's been coming up recently you might even see an ad for that right below me right now which is absurd again google and youtube totally dropping the ball here but this is arbitrage trading scams so they'll use the profiles of popular influencers like myself or any of the other big youtubers and they will say that there's some magical arbitrage telegram group where you give them a bunch of money and it's supposed to be me or one of the other guys and they're gonna steal your money that's a scam it's a scam if it sounds too good to be true you're getting freaking scammed please stop falling for the hundreds of scams out there the reason that these scams keep happening is because people keep falling for them please stop this is probably one of the biggest ways that people are losing crypto right now all this other stuff i'm talking about very very very important obviously but none of this stuff matters if you just hand your crypto over to the scammers willingly please please keep your head screwed on use your common sense if in doubt ask around ask some other people never be afraid to ask a dumb question because it's much dumber to have your cryptos stolen by scammers next let's talk about your passphrase this is that 12 or 24 word phrase that is basically your lifeline to your crypto if you lose that your crypto's gone and if you give that to scammers online your crypto's also gone never enter that passphrase into website never give it to someone claiming to be from support they're not from support they never need your passphrase so you might be approached on telegram by somebody saying that they're from support from some whatever company they're not from support they never need your passphrase never give it to anyone please so many people worry about you know somebody breaking into their house and stealing their passphrase or whatever else it might be but most people actually use the crypto by not being careful with it and making a mistake online with their passphrase now in terms of personal home safety obviously you should make sure your house is safe that's one very important thing but in terms of securing your passphrase that physical written copy never printed out never send it through a wi-fi printer that is a bad bad idea you want to write it down on a piece of paper using a pen old fashion,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,right old school way here this is how it's done make at least two copies you store them in safe different locations probably laminate those as well so they don't get any water damage investing in a fireproof safe to put one of those copies in probably not a bad idea either so make sure that you're keeping this safe guys next let's talk about hardware wallets the hardware wallets definitely the safest option for storing your crypto again ledger's the one that i use traysor is also a great company there's loads of other really cool hardware wallets out there these devices are very very important they're not like taking an old usb stick and putting all your keys on it that is not a safe device that's not a safe storage um alternative don't be cheap this is potentially you know a lot of money worth the crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and you're gonna cheap out and use an old usb drive instead of spending the 100 or 150 bucks to buy yourself an actual dedicated storage device which has all kinds of unique security features to keep your crypto safe so if you don't have one of these definitely get one of these you know hardware wallets are a lifesaver if you're not familiar with them go and educate yourself on them a little bit they're just it's super important so make sure you get yourself one of those make sure you're proactive as well what i want you to do after watching this video is go and do some homework take a bit of time take an hour of your time to sit down and actually go,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,okay i'm gonna review my security situation are my passwords good enough am i using two-factor authentication etc etc and actually start asking yourself is my security for my crypto adequate because the only person responsible for your security of your crypto assets is you that's it that's it it stops with you you're the only person responsible for this stuff so please sit down ask yourself those questions am i doing enough to keep my crypto safe because if you are a crypto investor you are a target there are hackers trying to steal your crypto right now think about that now that may or may not be the case but if you act in such a way it'll change the way that you approach your security because you are a target by being a crypto investor and just one you know post post script here at some point has got some bad news for you at some point you're going to die it happens to all of us the best of us no one gets out alive life's pretty weird like that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,but it's going to happen but hopefully when you die there's other people that will still be there um you know wife kids whatever it might be you need to ensure that those people know how to safely get access to your cryptocurrency because there's no point in you getting you know five million dollars of the bitcoin accumulated over the next years and you've done all this stuff to keep a crypto safe and then your family doesn't know how to safely access it and they fall victim to this exact stuff that we're talking about in this video so make sure they know how to get it maybe that's a written set of instructions in your will or in your safe or you just take the time to sit down with those people while you're still here to talk them over how to do that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,so you know just something for you to keep in mind as well and look this it's not an exhaustive list there's more security stuff for you to keep in mind but if you are at least starting to think about how to keep your crypto safe then this video has been a success because i really really want you to think how am i keeping my crypto safe what can i do to keep my crypto safe it's super super important so i hope that at least you got some sparks out of this video to make you think maybe i could be doing a little bit better on my security anyway those of course are just my two stories for the day your question what is your best security practice your security tip for anyone out there some newbies getting into the market let us know down below in the comment section thanks so much for watching today's video and peace out till next time [Music] you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA, here are seven things that i have done seven habits that i have that have helped me to become a millionaire meditate for an hour a day read a book a day do two hours of yoga do an hour of gratitude sleep for ten hours go to the gym for five hours live in complete financial minimalism and spend nothing and owe nothing nah don't do any of that stuff maybe some of that stuff but most of that stuff no look you don't need to do that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,either and i just want to say everyone's journey to achieving seven figures it's different some people get lucky other people work their asses off for decades some people just ape into monkey nfts at the right time make millions of dollars but in this video i want to share some of the things that i have done personally in my life that have helped me not just to create wealth but also to keep wealth my name's lark i make videos on investing if you do like that topic like stamp to date with what is happening in the investing world make sure to subscribe to the channel so smash on the thumbs up button if you know for damn sure that you are going to become a millionaire one day let's go ahead and get into this so the first thing that really helped me to build up my financial success was to just [ __ ] do it man honestly i swear this is probably one of the biggest killers of people's potential to create wealth,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,oh i'll do it next week i don't have the right camera i don't have the right microphone i just need to finish this sandwich put the damn sandwich down man start getting into it procrastination kills and clarity comes through action when i started making videos i just had a passion for cryptocurrencies i was super excited about everything going on the crypto space but i didn't have all the answers i just had a shitty camera an even worse microphone and i just started doing it for me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,yeah clarity did come through actually my videos got better over time i got more informative etc etc so many people i meet they've got an idea for a business an idea for a book and a deal for a channel or whatever it might be but they never freaking execute on it man sure maybe you try it and you don't succeed but you're never gonna know if you don't take action and do it second thing that has helped me in my journey is to get the right people around you i learned that be letting people into your inner circle it can either help you thrive or be like some kind of you know psychic vampire sucking away your time and your energy your clarity and probably some of your money too these days my friend circle is pretty damn tight and it's made up of people who largely can help lift me up people who you know keep their own standards high about the people they let into their life people who i can bounce ideas off of and who get it it's really important there's that old saying right you become who you hang out with well it is true and look i know it may not always be easy with some relationships and friendships but it's important to be honest with yourself about this topic are the people in your life helping you to succeed are they lifting you up are they really there for you when you need them it's important let's move on to the third thing and part of my journey to uh getting to seven figures and staying there is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,and it's been a really important one actually and has to say no a lot your time is your most valuable asset and it's absolutely critical to learn the power of no no no no no no do you really need to have that meeting or is an email going to work say no to the damn meeting nine out of ten times an email is fine and the meeting is just a waste of damn time the power of no is about having the confidence to be in control of your time and the power of confidence to be in control of your money your reputation and all that goes along with it for me it has been essential for me in just scaling my success on a daily basis people to say no a lot more than i say yes now before we start talking about the money part how i spend how i invest how i earn all that stuff i just want to snag a quick moment of your time to tell you about wealth mastery this is my cryptocurrency investor report it gets sent out twice weekly straight to your inbox,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,no bs altcoin reviews nft mints and updates d5 tutorials hot air drops news tips tricks and much much more our members absolutely love it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,i know you will too you can sign up for free using the link down below in the description now let's talk money money money the fourth thing that has been an absolute game changer of a habit for me in terms of creating wealth is creating multiple income streams this has taken many forms for me including stock dividends always nice get the stock dividends crypto staking rewards selling digital products like my awesome value-packed newsletter youtube ad revenue affiliate income from things like ledger or binance companies that i like companies that i use and even fixed term deposits at the bank now some of these are very very passive like crypto staking or you know bank deposits others require regular input regular work constant work things like the newsletter by the way did you know that your average millionaire has seven income streams think about that and then think about how many do you have and where could you find a new one the fifth habit that helped me to become a millionaire is to consistently invest there's absolutely no sense in just leaving piles of money laying around being lazy don't let your money be lazy keep a cash position,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,yes i always keep a cash position in stable coins and in cash in the bank but a hundred percent of my net worth in cash no personally i invest a large percentage of my income into cryptocurrencies as you very well know i invest into stocks i invest into medals uh soon looking to get in the property market as well as well as of course reinvesting money back into my business now most of this stuff is really long-term focused future me will thank me for investing today i look at every thousand bucks whatever i invest as money that'll make more money in the future just in the same way that today me thanks me for having invested over the last few years and building up the wealth to where it is now the sixth factor that's helped me is living within my means although i do have some nice things without a doubt i also don't go nuts with my spending for example i'll need one car not only in one car it's an ice car right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,but i don't need a vanity car i could go out and buy a lamborghini if i really wanted to but there's just no reason to do it for me personally the temptation for most people as your wealth grows is to spend more which is why so many people who for example win the lottery end up broke a year later which is a shocking thing when 100 million dollars in the lottery and then you're broke a year later you just blew it all the total number of your wealth can grow bigger so yeah you run out and buy a bunch of toys but that's the wrong mentality and it's a dangerous way of thinking as you grow your wealth my total spending as a percentage has not really increased although my total dollar amount that i might spend has increased we can afford a few more luxuries buy more organic food for example,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,so yes of course we do spend more than i did a few years ago but that spending has largely stayed in line with my earnings so important not to let lifestyle creep sneak up and steal away your money the final point for me it's not a financial one but i know it may sound cheesy but gratitude look i did not come for money every single dollar that i have i have earned i grew up in a very small town in the usa where the average annual wage is 50 freaking percent below the national poverty line i grew up on food stamps i grew up on second-hand clothes so believe me when i say i know damn well what a privilege it is to have the kind of wealth that i've been able to create by investing in cryptocurrencies and stuff over the last few years i realize that most people will never have that kind of money and i have immense gratitude to the universe for being able to bring these kind of financial blessings into my life,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qf7qx-B3NHA,and i think about that all of the time and what makes it even better is that i have achieved this success by doing something that i love to do i love crypto i love making videos love talking to you guys it's just so much fun for me so no matter where you are on your journey of investing just remember the mere fact that you can even invest already means that you have something to be grateful for in a world where so many have so little and do not have the opportunity to actually be out investing as we have the opportunity to do in the cryptocurrency markets anyway i hope that you found this video useful perhaps inspirational uh let me know which of these tips was your favorite and maybe even share one from your own life if you have achieved some financial success some financial abundance that might help other people on their journey down below in the comment section thanks so much for watching today's video and peace out till next time [Music] you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
F4YFtNHfGrw,welcome back everyone for another look at what's  happening in crypto around the world now we spend   a lot of time covering goings-on in the United  States but today it's time to forget about debt   ceiling debates Fed rate hikes and ripple versus  the SEC and instead turn the focus elsewhere   so join me for a look at some headlines  from some other corners of the cryptoverse   we don't have to travel far from the US for our  first story though just across the border into   Canada in fact Canada as you may know is where  binance CEO CZ hails from but that hasn't stopped   his exchange from packing up and leaving the  country on the 12th of May binance tweeted that   it would quote be joining other prominent crypto  businesses in proactively withdrawing from the   Canadian Marketplace unfortunately new guidance  related to stable coins and investor limits   provided to crypto exchanges makes the Canada  Market no longer tenable for binance at this time   now this follows the introduction of  new guidance by the Canadian Securities   administrators CSA back in February that put  significant constraints on how binance and   other crypto exchange platforms can operate  in the land of mounties maple syrup and moose   now it seems that binance had initially attempted  to comply when Bloomberg reported on the matter   back in April it stated that the new rules called  for quote unregistered crypto trading platforms   operating in the country to commit to a so-called  pre-registration undertaking firms are required   to follow tougher regulations on segregating  customer assets and prohibited from offering   margin or leverage to users in Canada now other  operators such as okx dydx and paxos had already   signaled their intent to leave the country but  binance did reportedly file that pre-registration   undertaking before giving up the ghost users now  have until the end of September to close out their   positions and find alternative platforms now this  move by the CSA could well be related to the news   that the development of Canada's Central Bank  digital currency or cbdc is continuing a pace   earlier this month the Bank of Canada announced  a public consultation for its cbdc which follows   earlier such consultations on crypto and  stablecoins according to crypto slate quote   the bank is primarily interested in learning about  how Canadians would use the digital dollar what   security features are crucial and what concerns  citizens with regard to cbdc's accessibility   and privacy the announcement also noted that  cash usage would remain the same even if the   Canadian digital dollar is rolled out one day  crypto and especially stable coins are viewed   by many central banks and governments as direct  competitors to cbdc's and it's no surprise then   that the crypto industry in Canada is coming under  pressure as a result that said it does seem like   the Bank of Canada is at least making a decent  effort to give Canadians a say when it comes   to their cbdc which is more than can be said for  other countries that famed Canadian politeness a   meanwhile binance is also finding itself under  the Cosh in Australia it suffered a double whammy   last week when Westpac the country's oldest bank  announced a ban on transactions to a number of   crypto exchanges including Finance Australia  this came on the same day that the exchange   was forced to suspend Aussie dollar Services  after its payment provider withdrew its support   it's part of an all too familiar tale sadly  authorities in Australia as in many other   countries are getting spooked by crypto in a big  way now one of the reasons cited for this latest   action against binance is the amount of money  lost to crypto scammers in recent years which is   certainly a big problem in Australia and elsewhere  it is worth noting though that cracking down on   exchanges like binance is not going to make that  problem go away nor does it do anything meaningful   to crack down on the scammers themselves sure  it might inconvenience those scammers a little   bit but the real losers here are the ordinary  upstanding people looking to trade crypto dig   a Little Deeper of course and a familiar culprit  emerges yup cbdc's The Reserve Bank of Australia   is Keen on them too coincidence,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
F4YFtNHfGrw,I think not anyway  it's easy to get hung up on countries like Canada   and Australia that are struggling to get to grips  with crypto while ignoring many other places where   it's being used for a lot more than speculation  and investment in many countries crypto is fast   becoming a Lifeline for ordinary people as they  struggle to deal with levels of inflation way   above what many so-called Western countries are  experiencing Argentina the Philippines and turkey   are three countries where inflation is running red  hot and crypto ownership is surging as a result   as cryptoslate reported turkey saw its levels  of crypto ownership Jump by 27 between 2021 and   2022 largely thanks to a peak rate of 72 percent  inflation Argentina trumped that however as its   inflation rate peaked at just under 95 in 2022  causing crypto adoption there to Surge by 23 and   a half percent inflation wasn't nearly as high  in the Philippines peaking at around 8 percent   in late 2022 but the country still saw crypto  adoption Rise by 23.4 percent while crypto remains   primarily a speculative asset in many countries  elsewhere it's becoming a part of everyday life   as people become increasingly tired of their Fiat  ,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
F4YFtNHfGrw,[ __ ] coins and turned to currencies that can't   just be printed at will by their governments  expect this trend to continue and keep an eye   out for increasing levels of innovation coming  out of these countries that are really putting   crypto to good use chances are future crypto use  cases and super apps could come from somewhere   like Argentina turkey or the Philippines but  back to a country where most of the focus is on   regulations now the UK was on the list of places  we visited in our last look at crypto around the   world and I'm afraid it merits a stopover this  time too that's because of a couple of bits of   recent news first up came the recommendation  by the treasury select committee that the UK   government regulate crypto trading in the same  way as it regulates gambling the old chestnuts   of quote no intrinsic value huge price volatility  and no discernible social good were trotted out   to back up the committee's reasoning this through  a bit of a spanner into the government's plans to   regulate crypto in the UK which we summarized in  a video a few months back link is below tldr the   proposed regulatory framework for crypto in the  UK is very promising albeit potentially subject   to changes which could make it less so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
F4YFtNHfGrw,but  there's clearly opposition from many quarters   which means that the signing of regulations  into law may not be a straightforward process   however a few days after the select committee  had made its feelings known a contradictory view   was expressed by the international organization of  Securities commissions iosco a watchdog group made   up of regulators from 130 jurisdictions and one  which I must admit I'm not all that familiar with   iosco which includes the UK's Financial conduct  Authority and the ussec among its members called   for the UK to regulate cryptocurrencies quote in  the same way as traditional assets such as stocks   and bonds according to the guardian doing so quote  includes requiring trading platforms to publicly   disclose how they vet crypto assets before  allowing them to be traded clearly explain how   they store and Safeguard clients crypto assets  and ensure they are separated from the firm's   own assets that might be used for proprietary  trading in short then a lot of compliance would   be required from exchanges and other similar  platforms which makes sense in the wake of the   collapse of Celsius Voyager FTX Etc the view  expressed by the treasury select committee   however is that regulating crypto in the same way  as other assets would create a quote halo effect   which could mislead consumers into thinking that  investing in crypto is safer than it actually is   which I think kind of misses the point I would  argue that anyone investing in crypto is well   aware of the risks involved and that treating  it the same as gambling would merely encourage   people to act even more irresponsibly than many  of them already do that said of course gambling   isn't taxed in the UK so if the treasury  select committee has its way well I'm sure   many would be absolutely delighted okay time to  end this Roundup on a high note by stopping off   in Hong Kong as I'm sure you're all aware retail  trading of cryptocurrencies will become legal in   the china-controlled city-state very soon and in  just a few days time on the 1st of June exchanges   there will be able to apply for a license from  the city's Securities and Futures commission sfc   to operate now a few things to be aware of before  you get too excited first up it looks like only   the major cryptos like BTC eth and a few others  will be accessible to investors in Hong Kong as   Bloomberg reported quote individual investors  can trade larger coins on exchanges licensed by   the sfc under Hong Kong's new approach safeguards  include knowledge tests appropriate risk profiling   and reasonable limits on exposure the coins should  be included in at least two acceptable investable   indexes from independent providers one with  experience in the traditional financial sector   now it's unclear which cryptos besides BTC and  eth meet this criteria but the list is likely to   be limited so although retail Traders will be able  to invest through licensed and heavily regulated   exchanges only a handful of larger cryptos will be  accessible to them and they will likely be heavily   vetted by said exchanges in order to satisfy the  powers that be that they know what they're doing   so don't count on a flood of inexperienced newbies  piling into ship on the 1st of June in other words   now of course the really big question here is  just how much pent-up Chinese money is going to   find its way into the crypto market via Hong Kong  China is notorious for its strict Capital controls   and the CCP will not be Keen to see a flight  from the Yuan to BTC eth and others inflows   from the mainland are likely to be restricted and  closely monitored that said this could well Mark   the beginning of a pivot towards crypto by China  as it looks to capitalize on the US's rejection of   the industry as I and many others have been saying  the next Bull Run could well begin in the East and   so we need to watch what happens in Hong Kong over  the coming weeks and months very closely but let's   leave the last word on this to Mr binance himself  CZ on the 24th of May he tweeted quote CCTV China   central television just broadcasted,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

amLBQZfIw3M,oh now the most noteworthy highlight is the record levels of open interest for Bitcoin options on the CME this is bullish because it suggests that there's significant institutional interest in crypto however it's also somewhat bearish because it suggests that institutions don't want direct exposure this makes sense considering that crypto exchanges stable coins and other Fiat to crypto on and off ramps have been facing extreme regulatory scrutiny in the United States large crypto market makers have also pulled back meaning that investing directly would result in lots of slippage for institutional size trades in any case as you can see the authors also created a sort of score for the market the score is from one to five with one being a high risk state which is obviously bearish and five being a healthy state which is obviously bullish the crypto Market itself currently has a score of 3.2 which is of course a cautionary phase now the first part of the report is about btc's recent price action the authors note that the macd indicator on btc's daily chart suggests that its price will go higher in the short term funnily enough you can see a clear Divergence between btc's price and the macd this suggests a medium-term reversal now this ties into the author's forecast which was surprisingly tame they note that BTC will see quote limited volatility in the short term something that was invalidated the week after the report was published BTC crashed by almost 10 percent it's not their fault though crypto prices are unpredictable if you want to know our forecast for BTC and the crypto Market you can check out our video about whether the crypto bull market is back using the link in the description speaking of the recent BTC crash the author's on-chain analysis reveals that most of the selling we saw during the 10 crash in April and the subsequent 10 crash in May came from newer BTC holders this makes sense considering newer investors have weaker hands can't stomach a measly 10 correction hmm anyways the second part of the report is about defy the first thing that stuck out to me was that tron's D5 protocols apparently have almost 2.5 million active users despite having a total value locked that's almost 10x less than ethereum's D5 protocols the user count there was just north of 150k the authors focus on the fact that there was lots of uncertainty about what impact ethereum's chappella upgrade would have on eth some of you may recall there was no shortage of headlines about the billions of dollars of eth waiting to be unstaked and presumably sold in the end eth pumped by four percent the authors also noted that D5 Protocols are starting to make use of zero knowledge proof scaling Solutions such as ZK sync in order to save on fees the tvl of zksync supported protocols has already hit 125 million dollars to put things into perspective zksync was first introduced back in March two months ago this ties in to the author's forecast which is positive for D5 however they note that macroeconomic factors could have a quote significant impact on defy this month it's not entirely clear which factors the authors are referring to but I suspect it has to do with competition for yield from U.S bonds if I'm correct we could see interest in defy increase when the FED pauses and especially when it starts to lower interest rates it just so happens that Defy is one of the crypto categories that we have our eye on for the next bull market and you can find out what the others are using the link in the description anyhow the third part of the report is about Bitcoin mining which is a bigger deal than you think if you watched our video about when the bottom of the crypto bear Market will be you'll know that the Bitcoin mining hash rate tends to Fall by around 50 percent near the BTC bottom this hasn't happened in fact the Bitcoin hash rate has continued to hit all-time highs this probably has something to do with all the fees that brc20 tokens and ordinals nfts are creating for Bitcoin miners this is something the authors take note of and they say that the fees being generated aren't that significant yet but could be soon as bullish as that is the author's own analysis forecasts a decline in hash rate that's because they note that Intel has announced that it will stop manufacturing Bitcoin mining Rigs and Texas recently passed a law that limits incentives for Bitcoin miners they note that one Miner has already shut down as a result the author's actual forecast says the same thing BTC prices close to 30k have given them some quote much needed relief but the competition is intense and badly managed miners could go out of business,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
amLBQZfIw3M,I'll add that the mining difficulty has also increased the break-even price is now close to 20K anywho the fourth part of the report is about regulations the authors note that U.S politicians are preparing stablecoin regulations which we covered in a recent video and that the G20 is working on a global crypto framework they also touch on the eu's mica crypto regulations which were finally passed just recently I'll quickly note that the financial stability board or FSB will be releasing Global crypto regulation recommendations this summer for context the FSB is an unaccountable and unelected organization closely aligned with U.S interests and it looks like its recommendations will be very anti-crypto now what's awesome is that the authors provide an amazing visualization of mica's key Provisions the most important one is that D5 protocols will not be regulated so long as they are sufficiently decentralized unfortunately the EU seems to be working on D5 specific regulations too make no mistake crypto regulations are required for the next crypto bull run to begin luckily there are many places that are in the process of passing Pro crypto regulations and not just the EU the authors note this in their forecast these crypto regulations will increase crypto's legitimacy and I couldn't help but notice that the authors provided a score for each of these crypto niches surprisingly the scores for Bitcoin defy and Mining were all four out of five not surprisingly the score for regulation is two and this makes me wonder what categories 5 and 1 look like in the eyes of the authors on that note the fifth part of the report is about derivatives which the authors put down as a three out of five they reiterate that the cme's Bitcoin option Futures have hit record levels of open interest they also note that the annualized basis yield for BTC suggests that investors are becoming more uncertain for reference the BTC annualized basis yield quote represents the cost or benefit of holding a long position in Bitcoin Futures and can provide insight into the market sentiment of Futures Traders as you can see this yield has been declining signaling a potentially bearish short-term trend this relates to the author's forecast wherein they note that bullish Traders are betting on btc's price to be 32k at the end of May and bearish Traders are betting on btc's price to be 25k at the end of May specifically the 26th of May the authors note that these were the same targets Traders had last month now I'd be remiss if I didn't mention all the volatility that's being caused by leveraged trading these days if you've been keeping up with our weekly crypto reviews you'll know that long liquidations and short squeezes have been primary drivers of price action in recent weeks and this seems to be getting worse what this means is that you need to be very careful when you're trading and be aware of all the key levels that your favorite cryptos could go to if they pump or dump and if you have no idea what key levels are I suggest subscribing to coin Bureau trading Dan will tell you everything you need to know the link is up in the top right now the sixth part of the report is about venture capital or VC the authors restate that VC investing went up by 170 in April totaling almost 900 million dollars the breakdown of where all that money went can be seen here While most of the deals were in defy most of the money went to infrastructure the authors underscore a whopping 220 million dollar investment in core weave a quote specialized cloud provider however it's not entirely clear if core weave is a crypto project it doesn't seem to have a white paper or token but Ico drops notes that it will be selling an erc20 token soon take note in their forecast the author's cautioned that although the month-over-month increase in VC investing is impressive it's not a trend this can clearly be seen in the infographic they provide crypto VC investing fell off a cliff last year and hasn't yet recovered even so there's still lots of money being thrown around the authors stress that crypto VC investment is heavily dependent on macro factors namely interest rates so long as the FED continues to keep rates High speculative VC investing will be minimal and this further underscores the fact that the crypto projects raising money now are very high quality take note I'll also quickly note that the authors gave this crypto Niche a 4 out of 5 which again begs the question of what a five looks like now the seventh part of the report is about nfts the authors note that quote there are concerns about the nft market going into freefall hence the two out of five rating their evidence for this free fall is the 65 decline in nft sales and the 50 drop in active wallets,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
amLBQZfIw3M,oddly enough nft lending is up by 16 degens the author cite the ongoing nft Marketplace Wars and the lack of excitement around the niche as two possible reasons I would add a third and that's that most of these jpegs have no actual value don't get me wrong some nft collections do have value but most of them will go to zero like most cryptos that said I must commend the nft niche for its relative resiliency most nft collections have been holding up quite well despite the declines over the last year this begs the question of what exactly happened that caused it to collapse if you think you have an answer drop a comment down below now when it comes to the forecast the authors have for nfts they say that nft marketplaces will continue to Trend downwards in terms of activity they also argue that the size of the nft lending sector isn't significant enough to influence the rest of the nft market I'd say it also invites regulatory scrutiny say I wonder if that's why nft holders are abandoning ship speculation aside the eighth part of the report is about game fire which the authors give a three out of five they note that the number of new crypto Gamers has been increasing with almost half a million newcomers in April however it's hard to ignore the gradual decline in average monthly users the authors take note of this decline but also note that the market cap of Gamefly cryptos has remained steady at around 14 billion dollars they also believe the decline could be partially due to the decline in the nft market and because only one new crypto game was released in April I suppose that explains it in terms of a forecast the authors are neutral they note that there doesn't seem to be any significant development in the game,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
amLBQZfIw3M,fine Niche but that it also seems to be trending sideways they expect the same to continue for the foreseeable future I imagine that assumes similarly neutral crypto market conditions as a side note GameFly is another one of the crypto niches that we're bullish on that's because GameFly Taps into the entertainment aspect of crypto adoption which remains mostly untapped the thing is that there are 2 000 GameFly titles betting on the base layer blockchain makes more sense or so they say now the ninth part of the report is about crypto stocks the authors note a bunch of updates about Argo blockchain bit deer clean spark coinbase and Marathon digital they also note that some crypto stocks outperformed BTC in March this is why they consider crypto stocks to be a leveraged bet on BTC boldly they argued that crypto stocks have exited the 2022 crypto bear Market already this is a bold claim because of all the regulatory issues that these crypto companies face and not just coinbase Bitcoin miner Marathon digital was recently sued by the SEC 2.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
amLBQZfIw3M,the authors then discuss all the measures being taken to restrict crypto mining in the United States and not just in Texas North Carolina Arizona and Arkansas are all introducing similar restrictions never mind the Biden administration's plans to tax Bitcoin miners into Oblivion in the name of ESG it seems that the authors also forgot to include a forecast for this crypto Niche but their three out of five ratings suggests they remain neutral I reckon It ultimately depends on which crypto stocks we're talking about Bitcoin mining stocks could continue to do well if BTC prices stay elevated and ESG Regulators stay away more about ESG in the description I digress and the final part of the report is about security tokens for those unfamiliar security tokens are basically tokenized Securities think tokenized stocks art and even real estate some of you might remember the so-called sto boom that emerged not long after the Ico boom during the previous cycle bull market memories aside the authors note that the total market cap of security tokens has remained steady around 15 billion dollars they note that INX is the primary platform where security tokens are traded which is probably why I can't think of any others off the top of my head might be something worth covering the authors also note that interest in security tokens is increasing around the world they discuss developments in Japan Liechtenstein and the UK I wouldn't say this is necessarily bullish though because I presume the bank of England doesn't want tokenized real estate to trade on ethereum if you watched our video about the future of finance that the central banks want to see you'll know that they want to create their own blockchains and tokenize all the assets in the economy including your ID the moment this happens you will owe nothing and be happy because you won't even notice what's scary is that real estate is the largest category of,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
amLBQZfIw3M,security token and I suspect this will continue to be the case take a second to consider that if the ownership of your house is tokenized on a government blockchain then you technically won't own it the government will scary indeed the authors give this Niche a three out of five and their forecast notes that the security token industry doesn't seem to be affected by developments in the crypto Market this makes me wonder why they included it in this report I suspect the answer is that someday all these assets will be tokenized on crypto blockchains let's hope so and that is about all for today's video folks so if you enjoyed it let me know by Smashing that like button be sure to bash that subscribe button too and ping that notification Bell,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

dB3RL3DzvMU, what's going on everyone my name is Nicholas Martin here at day two - today is October 14th of 2017 well folks as you all keep up with the channeling you know that from time to time I like to share trading to appear on the day to - channel it's a day I'm going to be talking about three misconceptions I hear a lot inside the crypto community for beginners I see a lot of people moving into this kind of innovative exciting market and a lot of people want to step in and they start investing or trading both ends you know it doesn't matter if you're just investing you're trading and a lot of people come in with eagerness and excitement and they end up losing money because they have preconceived notions of the market and how it operates and you know I get it I understand it's an exciting industry people want to jump into it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,but if you can't learn from the mistakes of the past that are very clear and open I you know and listen to the stories of fellow individuals who've been there I've made those mistakes I've been in the markets of stocks for six to seven years now and now in crypto for the past year and because of that I've learned a lot about how these markets operate so today I thought I'd give you a little bit of a shortcut answer two misconceptions of the market how to avoid these misconceptions and why you should at its core all right so let's go ahead and jump right into it folks the first one I want to talk about is in a lot of traditional cases we hear about what comes up must come down,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,and I would generally I know I generally agree with this I think most things eventually will have pull backs and this has been proven in markets that once something has a very nice run-up for example we see here with Stratos you know has a fantastic run up you can expect the pullback eventually things always pull back at one point or another no nothing's ever just going up exponentially it's never happened in a market at least in the long term of things however there is something to keep in mind the opposite is very far from the truth a lot of people think that just because something has gone down extensively it will go up you know a lot of people always mention to me like like Nick you know what do you think about this coin I'm like the chart doesn't look good I wouldn't buy that and like,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,but it's really low Nikki you say buy low sell high and the thing about that that's different between buy low and sell high buying the low and does not guarantee something is a good buy it does not guarantee that it is going to go up or that you are going to make money off that investment the reason that is is because in general things in the crypto space where it's especially something so early on the mass majority of crypto currencies out there which are now in the thousands are gonna lose they're not going to make any they're not gonna build any value in the long term and they're going to go practically to zero that's just how it is and a lot of people will simply just buy the low in thinking that they're all too completely fine it's not true and it's just as you know it just is unsafe to do that as it is to buy a fresh highs so again you have to have strategy when you're buying something now you do want to buy something at a low you want to buy something once it's had a pullback,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,"but if something's down 95% there's probably a reason for it there's probably a reason something has lost that much of its valuation and that doesn't always mean that it's a good time to just you know pour some of your savings in there to say oh let's let's see how it goes I bought low you know again buying low and selling high is great but just because something is continuing to sell off you can lose a lot of money I'll give you an example here on the Stratus chart if you would have bought Stratus literally just you know the help three weeks ago and not even a full three weeks it was around a hundred thousands and Toshi's and people will now picture these three can't these two candles right here did not exist and we were here at around 10,000 Satoshi's that you'd be thinking awesome and I'm buying out alone this thing was that 460 some of the dolls in Sedona she's I'm getting it a hundred thousand - geez man I'm getting this at a discount and then you're down 50%",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,so again you have to have strides in place to really mitigate your risk you know set stops and really say you know you know how much am I willing to lose even if I'm buying at these lows always expect that something could go down things could go wrong because they usually end up doing that especially in your beginning stages of investing and all right so remember just buying something low does not guarantee you're gonna make money the next I want to talk about is something that it kind of irritates me but I get it because I had the same misconception before I started trading stocks it's a very common thing by human nature because we look at items like stocks and crypto currencies like we do when we go to the store to buy a product we look at the price tag there's a big problem with looking at the price tag in dollars or even in Bitcoin when you're buying something on the market a lot of people say man Nick like bitcoin is is really expensive I just I don't know if like you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,"III I don't what I don't have like a thousand dollars to you know buy a fraction of a Bitcoin there's so many people don't know you of course you can buy fractions of cryptocurrency I'll mention that as well but the thing is a lot of people are like I don't even have like enough to really like you know make any serious money off of it or anything like that it's way too expensive like I kinda wouldn't pay five thousand something for a single Bitcoin and then I get people I'm like okay then what anybody else are you interested in and then I say well you know I was looking at dogecoin recently and it's like it's not even like 1 cent like what if this became the next Bitcoin you know I get that a lot and it's never going to be the next Bitcoin it's never gonna be worth $5,000 and there's a reason for that it's because the dollar amount and like the dollar valuation of dogecoin and Bitcoin are not determined determining his valuation or not what's determining the valuation is its market cap",overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,okay this value right here you can see they're quite different and it's for a good reason now you could have a debate about which cryptocurrency is better I would assume most people would say pick one but if you're a hardcore douche fan like I am I'm again in the major thing that you want to take away is how a cryptocurrency is valued you should never be looking at this or even the Satoshi mark and saying something is overvalued or undervalued what you do want to look at is its market cap on a fundamental sense you want to look at the numbers and see its market cap because dogecoin sitting at 122 million big one 95 billion okay now to be fair you've probably got much more room for volatility and growth with dogecoin within a short period of time but just as much with the growth side you have that with the loss but the real thing is here that I'm really trying to drill in is how valuation is calculated okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,so I'll explain it very simple it's the USD price in this case if we're measuring our valuation in US dollars in this case 122 million how we calculate that is by taking the circulating supply all of the doge that's out there right now okay so every single bit of dose that's been generated and that of course will grow over time with new supply that number multiplied by the current market price okay and that gives the valuation that we're given same with Bitcoin we have sixteen point six million Bitcoin in circulation and each one is worth five thousand seven hundred fifty nine dollars at this given moment because that we are able to calculate a valuation a little under ninety six billion okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,it's very simple math it's a simple multiplication problem between the price on the given market and the supply and that gives us market cap or market valuation and that is what you want to look for you have to ask yourself the question do I think Bitcoin as a whole not one Bitcoin but as a whole is worth ninety almost ninety six billion dollars do we think it's worth that now the honesty some people think it's worth much more and some people think it's not worth that that's all subjective it's up to you to make that decision same with dogecoin do you think that dogecoin is worth one hundred twenty two million not a fraction of a penny you know that doesn't matter that's irrelevant Doge could cut half of its supply and the price will jump up tomorrow and it might be something you know if I double its price because you're cutting the supply in half and that's simple supply in the main economics so same things applied with crypto currencies much like it is with stocks or anything else all right and the last one that I hear in this one as you all know I love I love long-term investing as I always been push it for you guys in unit trading III both ends of it but the big thing I always tell you all is diversification I don't care if you're,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,day trading I don't care if your swing trading I don't care if your long-term investing I don't care if you you know you're gonna long-term invest in the sense of just buying some stuff and never even touching it until you want to retire okay it doesn't matter what position you're in if you do not diversify you are set for failure okay now you might be the oddball that picks one cryptocurrency or one stock and just goes absolutely bonkers in the sense of your gains you do really good but I hear so much in the community whether it's someone who's that like $200 and their portfolio like I mean I'm just gonna gamble it on one cryptocurrency or I am just gonna put it in this one stuff I think it's gonna be the next etherium how can you be sure that it's gonna be the next big coin especially in a market where not only is it extremely hard to find whoa and what is gonna be the next etherium a multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,but also you know how do you know that you can solidify that in a market word over 90 to 95% of crypto currencies are gonna fail in the long term would you like those odds would you like to you know consider yourselves uh yeah I've got a five to ten percent chance of actually making a return to the long run I mean I don't think anyone would want to put themselves in those shoes but they don't take that kind of backwards kind of step and then take the whole picture in the perspective of the risk you're taking in that case we don't want risk to that degree we want to mitigate our risk we want to diversify we want to have a multitude of holdings and the way you do this in a very general explanation this picture for example you know we find cane crypto currencies we're gonna invest in,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,okay if we take that same mindset let's say that nine out of ten are going to fail you would still say like well Nick it just doesn't sound very good like I'm one one or two coins that might like make it in the long run and all the rest are gonna fail yes that is most likely gonna happen if you invest this early on a crypto currencies now there are certain safety measures you can set too like for example stops to mitigate your losses and then you can take that and put into something else and then you might you know eventually start picking out some winners however if you put it all into one you're going to probably lose everything if you put it into ten and when one or two those one or two winners in the crypto space being so early on are going to go up exponentially okay they are going to be winners for the long run and when crypto markets are multi trillion-dollar market in the the way way way way future you know you're not gonna be worrying about,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,oh I lost some money on you know did you buy it or I lost some many of you know money on uh you know the Monaro or whatever you know those those eight out of ten holdings because those were so so small even in the trading scheme of things if you do this among us you know ten different coins I can guarantee that in most cases you will win with more with those two winners one or two winners then you will with the losses of those eight others and especially people at some safety measures like stop limits so again you have to apply to your kind of strategy but this is more of a mindset okay it's very kind of general stuff you should keep on applying every time you do trading and investing because these misconceptions will burn you just like they have everyone else in traditional markets and in cryptocurrency cryptocurrency is no different it's the reason why it's charts and it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,you know everything bring just like a stock market you have to comparative things where is das or US dollars to cryptocurrency we have all coins to Bitcoin and you've got to treat it in the same way okay nothing is guaranteed you just keep going up so we don't want to again by just things that are low we do not want to look at things determinate of their their price value in the sense of US dollars and even Bitcoin as well we want to look at their valuation and market cap and we also don't want to go all-in on something these are very common patterns and I pray that you all will not fall for these traps as much as it can be eager to do so as much as the gamblers mindset will kick in and tell you to do this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,and it kind of the you know the shopper mindset in the sense of like looking at the price again these are really good principles to learn early on to make sure you avoid those mistakes and if you can have a trading history or an investing car you know path in your life and throughout your journey of cryptocurrency where you avoid all of these oh my gosh you are you are so fortunate because most people continue to fall for it I know I did I was like ah come on I think I could just buy into this I remember when I think actually I'll be fair with you all I think my first I remember exactly my first penny stock I bought when I was buying you know trading you know stocks and everything when I was very young and I thought I was gonna be the the one oddball out and everything and I thought I'd won it and luckily I didn't put too much money and I was young at the time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dB3RL3DzvMU,and I learned it very early on so it's best to learn these things early on avoid making this mistakes account I wanna stop rambling I just want to let you know one though because I think traders and investors mindset is important to build early on so you'll be successful in the long run alright everyone that's it for the video thank you all so much for watching if you guys have a question that you're dying for me to answer leave it down in the comments down below or you get a technical indicator you want me to cover on the channel that being said though everyone thank you all so much for watching and I'll see you all in the next video stay tuned you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fbiR8tVbjTQ, what's going on everyone my name is Nicolas Merton here at day two - and today is October 2nd of 2017 well folks as you all know the channel from time to time I like to share a training tip with all of you out there to help you become better traders and investors and today I'm gonna be answering a question I get asked way too much Nick when do I know when to buy what are you know what should I buy bitcoins should I buy 10x always I go what should I do there's so many questions I get in the community in relations well warden there right other than questions it's more requests Nick what do you think like I want to get your opinion on this folks I'm gonna tell you right off the bat I'm no wizard anything you shouldn't blindly follow me nor should you follow any other YouTube out there in that regard,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

fbiR8tVbjTQ,"and it has a nice pullback each time but even with those pull backs it continues to hold a decent out of its games and rallied to new highs we've seen this consecutively ever since it launched its ICO and because of that it's continued to rally to newer highs and we even got a rally up to 120,000 Satoshi's now this on a long term perspective looks fantastic on a swing trader perspective as well this looks great because what we're seeing now is not only did we see a great uptrend but we're seeing arc hold a lot of its gains and it's starting to find a slowing support around this level around 60 Dallas's oh she's so we're seeing it now out of pull back for Arak it's had a great great uptrend however we've seen it in the past where even though it has this pullback a lot of people be a couple mic cuts it's got from 120,000 Satoshi's to 60,000 probably gonna go to zero no folks",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fbiR8tVbjTQ,this is actually very very good we want to see pull backs but we want to see the holding of price strength conformation as we can see each time it's at an uptrend it's held a decent about of its games no not all of it but it's usually come back to correct those losses from that pullback and it's a healthy correction you need winners even as as much as they are the the king of crypto you know they might be the best you know cryptocurrency in your portfolio your favorite long-term holding and you might think they're worth you know a bajillion dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fbiR8tVbjTQ,and you still have to consider the fact that things have pullbacks and if they can have pull backs that's healthy that's good and that means that you're most likely gonna go to new highs in the future much like our cast over the past so again even though if you've watched my my video talking about us some good buy opportunities that we're watching right now which Ark is one of them even though it hasn't touched my levels yet again generally speaking this is the kind of range you want to buy you want to see something that's been winning consecutively and it's not a nice pullback close to around 50% okay and speaking of that that's our next point 50% pull backs,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
fbiR8tVbjTQ,okay now this is getting away from kind of talking about the longer-term perspective and this is more kind of a short-term perspective even though it's good to have past history of consecutive 50% pull backs a 50% pullback itself and holding that 50% pullback is a fantastic sign to buy into something so for example we saw nav coin compared to Bitcoin have a massive run-up over the past few days a few weeks ago however we've had a nice steady pullback this wasn't an instant pump and dump where it went up and then down down back to its lows and maybe even lower no it held a lot of its gains now of course it's common for a correction like this to happen I always tell people not to buy something after it's gone up three or four hundred percent because generally speaking it's due for a correction okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fbiR8tVbjTQ,"now what you want to do is you want to look for that pullback not to drop instantly but tonight have a nice steady correction backwards as an Afghan house especially compared to how fast it ran up but slowly pulling back and finding a common support around a 50% pullback if we take a look here the major amount of resistance for this was around the 40,000 satoshi range well now it's around 20,000 Satoshi's that's a perfect clean 50% pullback in price action so when you can find 50% corrections in price action make sure to see it you can see those comment levels of support where many times it's tested 20,000 satoshis in this case and once it's held that level once it's held that 50% correction level multiple times you can see that as a form of price strength conformation do you buy into that cryptocurrency now again it's not an absolute telltale sign to buy in sometimes it can continue to go down as we've seen with some crypto currencies out there however again it's a great sign",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fbiR8tVbjTQ,and it's a good positive confirmation that it's most likely set to go back to new highs the last one I want to talk about is a vert coin and on this vert cone example I want to talk about two indicators the 21 day and the 50-day moving average so how do we get those set up now we've talked about these are my channel before but I'm gonna go ahead and set them up on my chart so first off you want to look up moving average you're gonna want to set these values to 21 and then also 250 all right so with these moving averages there's a reason I want to talk about using these and I'm gonna tell you how I use them as a bullish indicator the 15 the 21 day are signs of momentum they're signs of a bullish price action so long as the price actions holding above those levels so for example we have here our 50-day moving average here it's the darker color of the two,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fbiR8tVbjTQ,actually I'll go ahead and not just for simplicity sake I'll go ahead and make that a brighter more noticeable color I'll do the same with the 21 day so now that we have a much more stand down we can see that as we saw in that sorry excuse me vertical wind come up we could see that it maintains support relatively well on the 50-day after it had a nice little uptick and from there we could see price strength confirmation we could see that it had found support on the 50-day and once it truly broke past and had its next uptick again we're looking for those pull backs if we can see a pullback and find it coming to the 21 day moving average rather than the 50-day once it got over the 21 day that is a very solid bullish indicator again I always recommend you only use moving averages they seem like simple tools that everyone's using but really they aren't being used by everyone and it can be such a great indicator especially in early markets so descriptive currencies where these simple indicators can really help you gain an advantage,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fbiR8tVbjTQ,and I always recommend if you can see some consistent support of the 50-day and then again consistent support on the 21 day moving average that is a market momentum mover that is something that is seen confidence exuberance and that's when you want to buy in on a pullback so again we talked about pull backs earlier on this would be a great level devine it's not a complete fictive percent pullback but again this one has been showing consistent signs of going up over time now along with that it's holding on to 21 day a very solid sign that this is ready for some continued momentum to the upside that being said folks those are my three tips I want to share with you all today I hope you got some good resources out of the tips that I gave you you'll have a question or an indicator or a trading strategy you want me to cover down below leave it in the comments I'd love to hear what you all want to see on this channel and stuff I love covering trading tips that can help you all become better traders and investors,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

embu6Vy-M78, let's go not everyone my name is Nicolas Merton here at day two - and today is January 4th of 2018 well folks today I want to spend a short period of time to talk to you all about some very helpful tips that you can take away from the video and apply towards your crypto trading and a lot of these are questions that I've gotten asked multiple times from the cryptocurrency community,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,but they're great questions so today I'm gonna be showing you all some very helpful tips inside of trading view this is my preferred charting platform and we're going to be going over a lot of great tips that you should apply to your trading and analysis first and foremost we're gonna be talking about the infamous question that I get asked all the time Nick how do you get the team indicator that allows you to have three moving averages all in one indicator which would mean that you could have more space for other indicators in your trading platform I'm going to show you how to finally get that on trading view and along with that as well we'll be talking about a few other important things such as setting price alerts so you don't have to watch 50 charts all at once,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,and yes you can finally go to bed and not have to drink your seventh cup of coffee and last but not least we're gonna be talking about how you can jump through different stocks or crypto currencies in any charting platform at a quick rate and move through and see different charts at a faster pace than what you would traditionally do alright so let's go ahead and jump into the video so first and foremost I'm going to be answering yet again the infamous question that I get asked all the time and that is how you can get the team up or three moving average indicator that I always use now keep in mind not only is it relatively simple to setup but it's completely customizable so we'll take a look at later but as you can see here I have the 50 100 and 200-day moving average where it's the SMA so it adjusts to whatever chart we're looking at but as we can see here I'm looking at the daily chart so each of these candles represents a day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,and it's gonna take the average of the past 200 150 day 50 days for the price action so let's go ahead here I'm gonna do the thing that many of you don't want to see I know I'm going to delete the indicator and now I'm gonna show you all how simple it is really to add it so first and foremost you want to come up here to indicator so you wanna go to your indicators tab and then in the search bar simply just type in three moving you don't have to type anything else,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,and you'll instantly see the only option there three moving averages and right there just like that the indicator is plugged in now keep in mind you probably look at it and say well Nick that looks different you know the colors are not the same and the you know the lines don't look exactly the same as they were on your indicator that's because I customized it everything is functionally the same it has the 50 s ma the 100 s ma and the 200 s ma however to change this you just gotta come up here to format or the gear icon and here's your first e ma your second MA and your 30th man you can go ahead and change the style of it if you want so we can come here for example in the 50-day I keep it on the green for the 100 I keep it on the orange and then for the last one the 200 I put it on the red,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,and then I drag them up one extra level for a little bit of added thickness to the lines and I go over here to inputs if I ever want to change the actual SMA number or the value of the SMA so for example whereas I would usually keep it on the 50 or 100 or 200 let's say for example I'm trading a memo or market momentum move or a cryptocurrency that's moving very rapidly to a parabolic trend and I want to see if we can find moving average support I would type in maybe for example 921 and 50 and instantly just like that it will readjust them just like that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,but again if you don't want that I just recommend to keep it at 50 100 and 200 those are my preferred choices so next time we're gonna be talking about setting alerts inside trading view for your cryptocurrencies what's great about training view is it has all of the API is plugged in for practically every exchange meeting in a very simplistic term you can get the price data for practically any crypto currency pair from any exchange they just recently plugged in by Nance so let's say for example we just wanted to watch Bitcoin for simplicity sake and you could do this with any of the crypto currencies or stocks if you trade stocks here on trading view you just simply come up here to alerts as you can see here we don't have any so we can click here to create a new alert and we can choose the condition so we're gonna focus here just simply the price now we can also do things for our different indicators if our indicator reaches a certain value or volume reaches a certain value but in this case we'll just do price we can come here to crossing so there's a lot of different different factors here we're gonna keep it simple though in the sense of just crossing the price,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,so let's say for example we are wanting to get an alert if Bitcoin passes twenty thousand dollars if so if the value or the price of Bitcoin goes to twenty thousand we will get an alert now we can choose whether or not we want to receive it only once or every time that it continues to cross it we probably wouldn't want it every time so just keep spamming us but we'll do it once it passes it along with it as well we can have an expiration date and time for our alert so for example if in a month we don't reach here we're not gonna get an alert for it so if you're looking for something that's moving and you want to get it at a certain price there you go or maybe you want something to sell off at a certain time period saying what same thing applies along with that is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,well you can select to show a pop-up or play a sound and you can choose what the sound is and how frequent it's gonna be you can do it every few seconds until you finally rush to your computer out of your sleep at 4:00 a.m. and you can also choose whether or not you want to get email email to SMS or SMS alerts and you can choose the message you want for there we got a pre generated 140 there and you just simply click create so it's as simple as that and it'll save it right there now if you want to make an edit to it or pause it or stop it or delete it you just simply click on the icons there in this case I'm going to go ahead and delete it because I don't need an alert for it for me personally all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,so the third thing we're going to talk about here is how to go through a variety of charts very quickly so if you ever wanted to be that cocaine / caffeinated trader who's bouncing around off the walls 24/7 this is how you do it and this is how you look like it's all your friends and family not skinny but it's a really cool way to just bounce the things very quickly first and foremost if you have a watch list over here and as you all probably know you can add symbols up here and it up here in your watch list on your account you can usually go ahead and click on like a variety of different charts and stuff and go through and see the price action of a lot of different kryptos but if you want to just run through you can even not have it selected over here you can just click on the chart over here and just start hitting the arrow key down the list until you find your crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,so let's say for example I'm going to go from neo to aetherium just type it a few times and I don't have to worry about typing out a theorem I just get it like that but it can also do another shortcut let's say for example I wanted to type it out but I didn't want to come up here not to click on this wall if you're clicked so long as you're on the charting platform and everything like that there's nothing else that requires key movements unless you're using the text tool,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,so if I just type in eth BTC and I click on whatever exchange I want or just press enter for whatever exchange might not matter to me just like that I can bring about price information without having to come up here to the left hand side so again some very short quick ways to maneuver through different charts on the platform and get towards what you're trying to look for anyways everyone these were some very short tips that I just want to squeeze in there to help you all stay efficient and stay fast and also stay a little bit more relaxed sometimes in regards to crypto trading I know it can seem stressful I know it can seem overbearing sometimes but there is a wonderful opportunity to be had for those of you out there and I'm glad you're taking it and trying to make the best of it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
embu6Vy-M78,so if you guys like these tips please give it a thumbs to give give the video a thumbs up let me know down below what tip you like the most if you're happy to finally learn about the team and indicator I feel like that's gonna be the favorite out of any of them please leave a comment down below and let me know and share it with a friend who's confused as well because I know it's a great indicator and all these tips as well can really help you in your trading journeys all right that's it for the video everyone thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all in the next one stay tuned you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU, what's going on everyone my name is Nicolas Burton here at data' - today is October 8th of 2017 well folks you should keep up with the channel and you know that from time to time I like to share a training to appear on the day - - channel to help you all better your trading and investing journeys through crypto currencies and today I want to answer a question that I got a lot from my last video in the last training tip video I talked about three signs - by three signs to get into a crypto currency to know when a good bison and it's time to make some gains however the other important question is when to lock in those games let's say for example you follow those trading tips or maybe you did it your own way and you're in the money that means you're you're doing well in your cryptocurrency position or maybe you know the topic of stock so you bought Apple stock or something,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,and you're up 20% well that's great but the question is when is it time to sell well in the cryptocurrency market this is a very important question because a lot of people can get carried away with double digit or triple digit gains in a short period of time and they can think that the fun money is gonna last forever well in cryptocurrencies that's not how you want to think and really you want to apply some kind of technical strategy to really make sure you lock in profits and stay disciplined so what are those three signs today I'm gonna go ahead and tell you all today three common signs I used to know when to lock in profits and sell on positions alright so let's go ahead and dive into it first one I want to talk about today is the 9 day moving average now I know you're thinking like Nick don't you always talk about the 50 day the hundred day and the 200 day and you say too rarely use the 21 day and unless something's in momentum mover,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,yes this is true however I use the 9 day moving average not as a level of indicating support but for fast runners you know a lot of us are investing in things for example I could go back through a lot of the momentum movers Stratos o Mesa ago which we're looking at now arc I mean I could list a dozen examples of examples where this type of strategy will work the nine day moving average is a great indicator to lock partial share positions on good runners so for example in the case of let me say go this was a very fast mover there was a lot of anticipation coming into it now this isn't always going to apply but it applies to around 60 to 80 percent of the fast movers and cryptocurrencies as we can see not only does it usually maintain above in the night naming average,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,but if it goes below the nine day moving average it's only slightly through the wix's and a way that I use the nine day moving average to lock in positions and we have to think about it under perspective of buying down in this range for example getting in early on in this case a good way to use the 90 moving average is when it ever dips whatever it dips below 5% of the nine day moving average so for example we take a partial share here we take a partial share here and once it gets back of course we want to wait till it gets it back up above as well now you can set stop levels that is something completely kind of arbitrary to what your risk and reward profile is it doesn't have much to do with this though the main thing to keep in mind is that every time you break that nine day moving average okay you sell partial share you lock in some profits,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,okay when you get back up there that rule will come back to apply again if it comes back to that again you take another partial share but in most cases once it gets back up against that nine days we've seen each time it rounds to new highs and then and then eventually you have a decent breakdown away from it and then you lock in probably your final partial share now of course the way to do this is really dependent on how you want us rate it some people want to take fifty percent of that initial time and be like amen look I'm up like you know 300 or 400 percent on something I'm gonna lock in half of my money some people won't say look this is gonna go up a thousand percent and I'm gonna lock in twenty five percent really it's all subjective to how you want to do it and how much your wrist or reward profile is my initial cell usually consists of around 40 to 50 percent of my profits locked in right off the bat,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,and then I break down each and every other kind of partial share as I go up the uptrend and of course I raise my stop level as well to cash out all of it in case if this thing starts really pulling back to lock in my profits because again you don't want to just be like you know giving you know all the way up here and then it just crashes down 50 percent no no no it's it's gonna go back up and then it goes down below where you bought it no one wants to get caught not but so many people do so again again adjusting your stops but really the main strategy here is taking partial shares once a cryptocurrency goes below the 9-day and stocks this doesn't apply as much because stocks are much tended to not move up this quick this is definitely something for crypto currencies,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,okay so for stocks would probably be something like the 50-day because they're not gonna move up as fast as a cryptocurrency in most cases the next thing I want to talk about is a topic pattern now what is a topping pattern well we've got one right here in this amigo chart tell me what candle on this chart I want to get you thinking real quick because I don't want to just tell you things I want to ask you all what candle on this chart looks like a topping pattern I'll give you a second well I don't know what candle you picked cuz I can't hear your voice through the screen however I will assume that you guessed this candle and if you did you are absolutely correct this is what's known as a topping pattern now everyone will tossed every names at it but this is generally what is known as the topping pattern in technical analysis now you can probably guess why it's called a topping pattern if you know how to read a candle chart,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,and if you don't I recommend you start using Canon charts folks I know a lot of people in these line or area charts candle charts are the way to go in this case with a topping pattern you can see that the wicks of the candle is well over two to three times the actual gain of the day and what that means is that a lot of this gained price action closed downward it was complete FOMO that means that buyers were coming in too quick,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,and then they realized that it wasn't fundamentally sound in the sense of that price action so it pulled back and because of that that speaks of over exuberance it speaks that there wasn't enough either enough volume there wasn't enough reason for it to move up and because of that it can make the chart look very ugly I know that sounds silly but because of that it can lead to a lot of sell side and it can really say goes to the market that something is overbought that something is being a little too over exuberant as we all know as I repeat a thousand time over exuberance can make up all the difference in just a few days or weeks and we're seeing that right now with whom you say go so again when you see a candle like this especially for those low volume crypto currencies that as much as I told y'all not to trade I know some of you want to go out there and trade do not chase crypto currencies that have these really long drawn-out wix's you want to see candles like this that have full green bars that continue to go up and confirm price strength confirmation you do not want to buy into something like this so again you really want to make sure that the candles have solidified price action a lot of good healthy green candles and of course they have healthy Corrections as well not these topping out wix's where the wicks itself makes up more than two to three times the standard price action of the day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,all right so the last thing I want to talk to you all about and of course this doesn't always apply to all cryptocurrencies it's just a simple signal that you can look for in the sense of technical patterns it's a head and shoulders pattern now we've talked about this on my channel before however today I want to go ahead and talk about it specifically inside of me say go again all three signals that I want to talk about today we're founded on me set go it's quite simple so we're gonna go ahead and use the drone to I recommend use it using a line tool but in the case of tradingview it's it's very drawn-out but here we go in the sense of drawing it simply we just have to draw the first shoulder the head and then the other shoulder okay so this is a very common drawing pattern in crypto currencies and stocks any financial investment vehicle you'll find a head and shoulders a lot now a lot of people will call in Elliot waves a lot of people call it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,I've been hearing so much about Elliot waves I don't get what the craze is about that but anyways in the case of head and shoulders it's a very common pattern and it really looks like head and shoulders it's pop it's really much like you know going up your shoulder going up your head bouncing down again and then going down to new lows as you can see the selling is starting to pick up on a Mesa go because people are realizing this is a head and shoulders and you'll find us a lot in other cryptocurrencies that are topping out or have had ridiculous run ups like owe me a go it's gone up more than 10% it needed a correction okay so you'll find this a lot when there's so much strength behind something but after a while this steam runs out the volume stops flowing in the price is too overbought so again look for these kind of Head & Shoulders patents and ironically you'll find this a lot in these topping patterns you'll find it when it starts to roll over and it has that almost kind of dead cat bounce,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,"and it's like we're gonna get back to those highs don't worry about it and then you get caught in the bear trap and you get pulled down and of course you start losing your profits so these are three great signs you can use to start you know timing the market a little bit better locking out of your profits knowing when to get out a little bonus tip is well and I've mentioned this in the past I feel like it'd be important to mention it notice where a Mesa ago stopped really getting bought out and of course we had the wicks go up here but sometimes you have to look for the big evens 300,000 was the resistance point really I think that was the big even as you can see the candles over here couldn't get past it and when I try to get past there it couldn't remain over 300,000 the fourth tip I'll give you on this kind of a mini tip is look for the big evens you all know I talk about this a lot",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bzs8-7OqWSU,"but I thought I'd toss it in there because that's a great way to know when to sell something okay because the whales are going to sell at the big evens 300,000 in the case earlier at I know that for example 200,000 was a huge resistance point there's a lot of sell side action at these levels and because of that you want to lock in your profits a little bit beforehand so it might have been smart to lock in some profits here before 300,000 on these days again be ahead of the game use strategy use these technical analysis skills tools and patterns to stay ahead of the game against the competition and I can promise you you'll have a much higher chance of on top well folks that's it for the video thank you all so much for watching I hope you enjoyed these tools and all the things that are shared in the video if you do enjoy the video please drop a like and leave a comment down below if you want to see another training tip video and a certain topic covered on the training tip series I always love getting your feedback",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

8PNWFdry6WA, what's going on everyone my name is Nicolas Merton here and deta - and today is October 11th of 2017 well folks as you all keep up with the channel you know that from time to time I like to share a training tip or two here on the channel and today I'm gonna be sharing with you all the top 3 long-term perspectives you should have on cryptocurrencies now what I mean by that well today I'm going to be stepping a little bit out of the trader room we're gonna be talking a little more long-term and talking about some mindsets you should have ingrained in your head every time you're making investments in cryptocurrencies and this can go for trading as well because you got to realize that you know even in your trading world investors mindset is key,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,okay we need to continuously maintain those similar principles of picking good players and knowing when to get out of something etc so without further ado let's go ahead and talk about those top three tips today the first one I want to talk about is you are much better off investing in something at an early stage and waiting patiently rather than trying to swing trade the market with things that are going crazy all right now what do I mean by that I mean that you are much better off investing in doing heavy research early on into an undervalued project and investing it in that time period and waiting patiently over a year or two or three rather than trying to swing a certain asset that has already had a big run-up or a cryptocurrency in this case now why is that this chart right here of Stratus is a perfect example,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,okay if you would have bought Stratus whereas for example I think Chris done actually you know did a you know video talking about this where he did invest in Stratus extremely early on if you would have invest in his dress back here now of course I think we could all play captain hindsight but if you invest in cryptocurrencies when they're at these lows when they're completely undervalued no one sees any value in them and then you have one of these exponential breakouts you have a mass opportunity to cash out exponential valuations from where you bought the guy who bought here and maybe sold here maybe the guy who bought here and sold here or the guy who bought here and sold here can't say the same thing doesn't matter if they made 20 percent and lost 20 percent it's nowhere close to where the investors who bought down here made money and this is why I tell you what a long-term invest and do your research because at the end of the day I want you ought to make those exponential gains I think we all do,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,but I will tell you it's around 98 to 99 percent of people who do not do that research what no I can tell that I can tell that because down here where the price was extremely low keep in mind this is on on trading views so the volume is in its own currency not Bitcoin I can tell that by the price being extremely low and the volume even being lower than over here where people are paying a much higher premium on the price that means that so much less money was circulating in the actual trading of Stratus so if you can get in early on if you do that research I can I can guarantee you folks it will pay you off more times than not okay so keep that in mind long term invest for the undervalued players and think there is about a find value in things where no one else sees value in it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,okay because there will eventually be a point where people start to see value and if it's a great project and it's got potential and adoption and you'll be able to sell it up here to some guy who's gonna buy your bags all right the second thing I want to talk about and this is something that I always emphasize you know we are we are really going through what is kind of known as dot-com to point out now if you don't know what the dot-com bubble is the dot-com bubble was the early phase of the internet coming into fruition and within stock markets tech companies in the internet space were booming Amazon was one of them but many companies that originally went onto the market and then eventually failed or they lost massive amounts of valuation all right and this was you know Yahoo all kinds of different companies out there and a lot of names like pets.com and literally websites I'll give you one a for a good example here there was a website that all it did was sell chocolates,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,and I think if I remember correctly in IP Odin gained like hundreds of millions of dollars if not a billion dollars in valuation was making no money right it's just stupid it doesn't make any sense but everybody was loving and everyone was making so much money and this is exactly what's happening and in crypto currencies and especially in the ico space folks it happens okay it's a new market it's exciting and there is something we need to keep in mind here when there's a lot of crazy things going on there's a lot of new names coming into the space we need to take a step back and take a little bit of a historical snapshot let's go here to August 18th 2013 well this emphasizes two things me it kind of emphasizes our last point but it also tells me Wow the game's changed I mean you really have to think about it it's only been four years but four years in the crypto space means the world,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,it I don't even know what world's coin is digital coin pure coin at fifth place the game's change every single day folks literally adain the crypto space is almost like a year there's so much going on there's so much new and exciting things going in this industry that you have to keep in mind what you're most likely holding for about 80 to 90% of it is not going to take off long term and or at least over the next three to five years and then after that that number increases to around 97 to 98 percent over the next 10 to 15 years most cryptocurrency projects can fail because anyone can create one anyone can go out and create their own ICO so long as they meet within the legal confines of their country so we've got to play it smart aetherium wasn't even you know a thing here and now it's the second largest cryptocurrency things can rise and fall instantly okay so keep that in mind you know you want to look for stale player nonny's three they're still on strong you know like what's still here ripple still here Bitcoin still here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,but again a lot of the coins behind that these were still leaders peer : was fifth and now it's not even the top 100 coins feathercoin Zen way no look what same way probably all of them same exact thing so again innovation in this space will lead to so many losing but a lot of new players coming in to rise and fill those positions alright and the third thing I really want to emphasize a lot of people ask me Nick what is it that makes you bullish on the cryptocurrency you know is it you know the features of that cryptocurrency is it the team of that cryptocurrency do they have people who worked in leading industry companies or organizations or you know is it the market that it's going after,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,well it's not any three of those okay those can be very good indicators that something is a great long-term project that may make me feel much more comfortable investing in something I only care about projects that either are getting adopted or look like they would easily be able to be adopted all right now for example give you a good picture right here with Bitcoin Bitcoin has continued to grow because it has been the face of cryptocurrency was the first ever cryptocurrency and because of that it gains a central advantage if you know about aetherium if you know about litecoin if you know about ripple if you know about every other cryptocurrency you know about Bitcoin because if you bought it through an exchange you had to exchange Bitcoin or you just didn't really heard it in the media things it was the first one out there and you know adoption comes through a few different factors being first the plate can be beneficial,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,I mean it was this interesting concept of taking centralized power away and bringing it into the hands of the people and at the time that was revolutionary because of it it now has an 80 billion dollar valuation so you've got to offer something new to the table one thing for example I can list off a few examples you know the course these aren't recommendations these are just things that I personally you know we consider to be done the same Ali vert coin for example which is one of my long-term holdings gives me a very enticing interest because it has a one-click miner now that might seem like something so simple and not something for you know masculine option,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,but it's going to allow people to participate in mining it and if everyone can simply use a one-click miner and get into something that's going to entice a multitude of people who see that simple approach to get it you know get a part of the state and you know become a part of that movement and very simple integrations like that are going to encourage people to get involved with certain crypto projects and when that involvement happens when that adoption comes into that cryptocurrency it doesn't matter what aim it is or what market it's going after what team it has the adoption comes from having a great product something that's simple something that attracts people and actually has a use case to it all right so again it's a very broad stroke of the pen,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
8PNWFdry6WA,but I hope you get what I'm saying in regards to the fact that adoption is the most key factor to any long-term project even if you're trying to swing trades well you need to see adoption in something well anyways those are my top three kind of philosophies of a long-term investor I hope you all enjoyed the video if you guys liked it please give me a thumbs up and leave a comment down below if you have another trader philosophy I didn't miss or traders are investing philosophy that I didn't mention but anyways everyone until then I will see you all in the next video stay tuned,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk, all right guys welcome back it is Friday man time really flies as you know each and every Friday we bring to a bit of extra insights a bit of extra knowledge a bit of extra Alpha and we do it by bringing Phil our head of research here at Morales now Phil has insights that I normally don't have he will give you all kinds of decent insights on the whole other level and that's what you should know about this episode right now we're entering the true division land I mean really really true digital land as you will soon see it's extremely high risk crazy high risk so you better strap in strap in your safety belts trapping your safety goggle because listen here is where we're looking for high risk High reward insane insane Vision territory coming up right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,but we hope that you will find it useful we hope that it will give you a bit of insights a bit of perspectives you normally would not see you normally would not experience just watching YouTube normally that's why we give you a bit of this weird perspective on the market these coins I don't think you've seen them annually let's go guess let's go deep into the Oakland Forest uh please Midfield you met him already during the past month let us know in the comment section what you think about this kind of content and on that note I'm bringing to Phil head of research here at Varan welcome back D5 Adventures,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,I'm Phil head of research at Morales and this is your Friday all coin update today we're taking a look at five big altcoin opportunities each of them different in why I brought them to the table and each of them with great potential should the right circumstances transpire every week I'm looking to catch The Narrative of what's big coming up soon sometimes the time Horizon is a week sometimes a month sometimes six months and depending on the type of asset and why we're getting into it depends on what we want to do once we take that position first on our list today is d-force a lending protocol with exposure across multiple chains and with a token price which is heavily down from the all-time high let's take a look now d-force is a lending protocol that is on multiple chains scrolling down and taking a look at the chart as well as the all-time high price we can see that we're more than 95 percent down from the all-time high with a long period of consolidation starting from basically over a year ago so with some downward action since then in a slight recovery of recently now one thing I want to pay attention to here is this all-time high price and where this occurred taking a look at the Bitcoin chart here we can see that the Bitcoin price had not even reached an all-time high yet in fact in September of 2020 was this little tiny downward dip here before an amazing takeoff and that's exactly when we saw this appreciation for deforce so as a result we need to consider what types of pumps like this we're going to see before the big pump in Bitcoin going into this next cycle will DeForest do a repeat of what it did previously well with a strong presence across multiple chains it's definitely a contender let's take a look here we see that ethereum mainnet arbitrum optimism BNB chain polygon and kava are all supported by d-force and that the lending options change based on which platform your look looking at so here we're switching over to the ethereum mainnet and we can see that we have a much stronger diversity of lending and borrowing options whereas optimism and arbitrum will also have a good selection but not quite as vast as we can see here that first asset is a great example of a coin with a pump history that happens before Bitcoin not after and that's where we're at right now Bitcoin just went down from 30k earlier this week,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,so we're at a pre-bitcoin pump situation and we want to look for assets that perform well in those situations now on top of this we have some other assets to look at this next one just experienced a major exploit and we need to figure out what to do following this type of exploit to take advantage of the circumstance the next asset we're taking a look at today is 100 Finance now a disclaimer right off the bat this protocol just experienced an exploit but sometimes when things like exploits are experienced it signifies opportunity for those who know how to get in and what to do as a result so for me I'm looking at this similarly to what happened with easy five finance and we're going to take a look at that in just a second now the token price of 100 finances completely in the tank I wouldn't recommend touching this with anything,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,and I don't know that it's going to come back without some major tokenomic adjustments this is because faith in the protocol was completely lost during the exploit here we can see looking at 100 Finance on defy llama that the protocol hack occurred here and also there was a re-entracy attack here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,so we have two hacks one in March and then one in April as a result this protocol is truly struggling to maintain relevancy and to recover however sometimes when Protocols are struggling to recover they do drastic things and those drastic things can result in big opportunities for the people following the protocol let's look at easyfy as a case study so this is the easy five version two token and the easy 5 version 2 token is the second EZ token issued by the protocol the first token lost all of its value during an exploit that occurred on this protocol if we take a look at the token price what we can see is that after this easy five V2 token was issued the price went from just over a dollar to nearly 35 dollars in the course of about six months that's an extreme only short time for huge appreciation should the hundred team decide to issue an IOU or other token in order to renew their tokenomics and recover from the hack situation it may be an opportunity for speculators on that asset,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,so it's something that we want to watch for of course it depends on 100 Finance doing the right thing and keeping updated with the community on what's going on in order for that situation to transpire the same way that it did with easy five next up is an asset that I've been watching for a long time with the recent rise of the China narrative it may be the right time to start looking at this asset again as well as some of the others that we point out in the video next on our list I've got a special one for the cosmos ecosystem fans Among Us Iris net now those of you who've been watching the news know that lately China has been in the news with big moves going on specifically in the areas of Finance irisnet is interesting because of the way that it stands out when comparing it to other assets under the China category as provided by coin market cap coin market cap is useful for tracking the China narrative in general and keeping track of which coins are closely associated with that narrative if we take a look at this list we see a lot of singular ecosystems some have interoperability and some do not but scrolling down a little bit of course we see some major players like ontology Tron right on top and iost some old time favorites for sure and some to watch going into the next Bull cycle because they have a long history of Performing well during bull markets however if we go just a little bit further this is where we start to see maybe those with the most potential,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,and then we find our first Cosmos chain in this list Iris net ranked 439 on coin market cap looks like an opportunity to me especially if you're able to hold four six months or so to see what happens here of course it has Cosmos IBC connectivity that means any asset on Iris net can be traded on other Cosmos chains such as the osmosis amm protocol heading on over to osmosis and taking a look at the pool selection we can see right here that one of the top pools supported by osmosis is an iris net pool paired with osmo with an APR of 45 furthermore we can see that with a liquidity of 240 thousand dollars the fees collected in only seven days is just under five hundred dollars finally we have a picture of irisnet as a high performing asset with a good entry price based on the current price position see right here we have the max time frame and all-time high during 2021 the last huge Bull Run will we see a Resurgence possibly we've definitely seen an increase in price during other Market pumps as well as we can see here so far we've checked out a couple of assets that have a history of pumping at different times during the Bitcoin cycle this next one has yet to pump during a Bitcoin cycle because it's too new another type of asset we want to have on our radar next up we're taking a look at some very high risk options including Grainery Finance with the governance asset grain now taking a look at the chart we see that this has only been tracked by coin gecko since this month starting the 14th of April,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,so very very limited amount of data available on coin gecko however if we take a look at the asset itself we see that there's also quite a bit of Supply that has not been issued yet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,so why are we interested in this what we're interested in it because it's brand new and it's just moved into version two so continued iteration is a great sign as well as new assets that have not yet lived through a bull run because they have yet to really set that index price during a bull market if we take a look at the protocol itself we see that it is available across several different blockchains kind of similar to what we saw with deforce so with deforce we have a lending protocol that did well in a previous bull market and we're hoping we'll do well again with Granary we have a brand new protocol that's going to blaze its Trail for the first time in this new bull market and on the basis of that we're going to be able to take some positions so let's take a look at how this looks across different chains if we click on medicine we see a great selection of lending options from Granary Finance on medis and then with more popular chains like Phantom and optimism we can see that those lending options are even more extensive looking at Grana refinance socials recent posts from 2 days ago or less are great to see,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,and so we hope that continues as they work to build out their ecosystem next up we have an asset that I found when using Morales money during a live demonstration for some of our Academy participants after that I ended up talking about the asset further with some members of our team and now I'm really ready to share with you guys what I found let's take a look last on our list today is the new and exciting protocol nasdaqs now NASDAQ is an exchange protocol that looks to bring real world assets into the blockchain environment for the purpose of trading in exchange taking a look at the protocol itself and then selecting the launch app option we see that we have staking options for Native nsdx as well as the nsdx usdc pool I tested both of these out earlier today I had no problem depositing to this pool here however I did run into some issues when trying to deposit my liquidity pool tokens,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QZQIt9ONwSk,I've reached out to support on that so be aware that there may be an issue with this I was using a browser-based wallet without a connected Hardware device in this particular testing instance and using a chrome based browser taking a look at the NASDAQ price chart and zooming out to Max we see a long history of price activity starting as early as September of 2021 but it looks like the recent protocol launch has really pumped the price let's take a look at that on the recent huge pump in the past couple of days let's hope that that continues for the holders congratulations if you're holding nasdaqs already thanks for sticking with me to the end I hope you enjoyed that look into some high risk protocols with huge gain potential remember anytime you're investing in high risk protocols there's a chance of permanent and total loss but by hedging our bets correctly and diversifying amongst a good selection of possible Pumpers we can put ourselves in a great position for huge gains see everybody in the next Friday update,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ir_Xx7GQmOs, hey what up guys welcome back to my channel and today we're going to take a look at how you would fork bitcoin and create your own altcoin also we're going to especially focus on how the committee history looks like for our new forked repository and this is very very important for you as an ICO investor as a cryptocurrency investor to understand and really see how how this process looks like because many coins are forked of Bitcoin many coins are forked from other forked coins and the commit history might look confusing and you might be misled if you are not aware of how this process looks like so that is exactly what we're going to take a look at today so you go to the Bitcoin github just just google Bitcoin github and you will find it very fast and you see here on the right we have a fork button,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ir_Xx7GQmOs,so we just click on it we select an account and now we just wait for a few minutes while it's being copied so what what is actually happening is that github is copying the Bitcoin repository and placing a copy of that repository in my account so all of the code and also all of the commits which is very important to this video so as you can see guys in my account even a Lilliquist we have this new repository called Bitcoin and it says that it is forked from Bitcoin Bitcoin so we for it this repository from Bitcoin and now it's visible in our own personal account and of course if you worked Bitcoin and you want to start your own,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ir_Xx7GQmOs,I'll I'll coin the first thing you would do is to change the name because this is still called Bitcoin in my account so the first thing someone would do is to go to settings and just change this to something else let's call this make make a coin make a coin I'm not sure if this coin exists maybe there is already make a coin so many coins man alright let's just call it mega coin and also we would very quickly change this to mega coin is awesome so now we have changed the name of the repository now it is called mega coin we've also changed the description to make a coin is awesome perfect now we need to change all of this very easy to do you just go to read me here and you edit it and we just remove everything and we say mega coin is gonna take over Bitcoin and be worth 10k or something else ridiculous yeah you can write whatever let's not claim claim that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ir_Xx7GQmOs,but it is going to take over bit and we can claim that so we can just say committed so this will actually count as a new commit to our repository and we see that it has changed so now if we go back we see it's called mega coin it is a fork from Bitcoin and we have our own custom readme file here which is making is gonna take over Bitcoin or wherever okay good good,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ir_Xx7GQmOs,so guys now I can send this link to someone and if this person is not aware of how Forks work this person might think that I have made all of these commits and that I have assembled this amazing team of 449 contributors to my mega coin and this is exactly what I want to bring your attention to in this video if I fork a coin all of the commits all of the commit history and all of the contributors up to the point where we've made the fort they will be visible in my repository so if we take a look at the commit first of all we have the commit we just made which is as you can see we can take a look at what actually changed and that is that we change the readme file from all of these to just make a coin is gonna say cover Bitcoin this is number one but all of the other commits we didn't make of course and these other commits are from people who contributed to Bitcoin and once we work all of these commits are transferred to our account as well and so this might seem that we have just made all of these commits that mega coin team has made all of these commits and that mayor Cohen team consists of all of these contributors but it it is just me and in five minutes I created this coin from nothing and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ir_Xx7GQmOs,yeah guys this is what I want to bring your attention to and also we can go ahead here we can we can change something for example let's change something in this file this will not be a serious commit we're just playing around but let's just change our no let's change this to true and we can go here and we can just write something changed logic in coins of course if you would be serious about developing your old coin you would clone the repository to your computer and when we say clone clone we basically mean you would download it to your computer and you would edit it with an editor and ID and then you would push it when you are finished you wouldn't actually code on the github website but we're just playing around so if now we have made this commit and if we go back to commits you see guys that we have a new comment change logic in coins that's C++ we take a look at what actually happened and we see that I change this from false to true this might actually break the whole the whole coin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ir_Xx7GQmOs,and it is not something serious it's just a play commit but this house looks that looks like guys before all of the commits are still here all of the contributors are still here and we have just created our own altcoin called mega coin and as you can see it was very easy to do so all there is left for us is to pump and huddle guys I'm sure this is the way to go or not all right guys it that's it for today and if you are a new viewer and you like blockchain technology if you're Bitcoin or programming you should definitely subscribe to this channel because you will find this channel interesting I myself am a software developer and I post videos every single day except some days now on them and you will find this channel interesting because this is exactly what we're talking about also you can join the slack community we have going for I have a non tech you can find the invitation link in the description and I'll see you guys tomorrow,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg, check check and we're live guys welcome to another episode of good Mario crypto only here on island Tech yes guys pal chain is live right now the crypto Community has a whole new Sandbox to play we have a whole new industry to build on pulse now as you know Bitcoin right now is dumping slightly we do see Bitcoin has 20 at 26.8 Bitcoin right now is taking a hit as you know our Target is 23 we are breaking down from the Inver from the head and shoulders and the target is 23.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,but let's speak about something very important namely how is the launch of hex gonna affect the altcoin market overall can we really see an alkan season started because for the first time we have the energy in the hex Community being now able to to go nuts on pulse so pulse is launching right now it's live right now hex Community now can build things they can now funnel their energy into building and creating ecosystems and that's going to be so interesting to follow and that's what we're going to discuss and the questions we're going to focus on are the following number one how much did the sacrificers make number two why is hex dumping on eth as you can see if you go to crypto bubbles hex is down 33 today why is it so and we're also going to be discussing pulse X,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,I will show you the exchange which is past existence exchange for for pulse we're going to be speaking about what this means right here this dollar amount and much much more if you like this kind of content guys if you want to be informed if you like staying informed learning about new ecosystems such as pulse if you are in pulse or in Hex Smash Up the like subscribe to the channel and let's get going as soon as possible write in the comment section by the way write in the comment section if you hold hex or pulse if you sacrifice or not let's let's discuss let's discuss what uh what is happening first and foremost let's State the basics the basics is that right now we will have two separate uh hex so one hex is on if okay let's write let's write it down so that we remember it this is something that is is getting a bit convoluted if you don't write it down so hex on eth is no longer called hex guys so when you look at people discussing uh hex on eth it's no longer called hex,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,it is now e hex okay and e hex is not gonna be one to one interchangeable with hex on pulse chain okay so basically you have two separate versions one hex on if and once and another one which is hex on pulse so hexon pulse is called hex this is the real hex this is like V hex okay it is sometimes called P hex also because it's on pulse chain but I know Richard wants it to be called hex so whenever the community will say hex from now on they are gonna refer to hex on pulse and if someone says P hex they also mean hex on pulse and this uh the price of hex on pulse will not be the same as hex on eth okay so there are two different coins probably they will not have the same price I mean obviously it's game a game theory here but is it going to be the same price as on eth probably not,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,or I think not because there are two different assets they may still move in the same direction so as you know there is this discussion about Hearts uh Hearts law uh which basically states that if two assets like for example e hex and hex if you have a tracing pair EX versus versus hex for example on pulse X uh then if one of them moons in dollar terms the other will Moon as well because they are denominated in each other so if one of them goes up in dollar amounts and the the ratio is the same between them then the other also goes up so this is the basics you need to know about that hex is uh there are now two hacks and what's interesting is that I just was on a stream with a bunch of hexagons and people really into this and they say okay they say which is which is still something that I'm thinking about and internalizing but according to them it is likely that both hex on eth and hexon pulse gonna have high price,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,okay the the the the price performance of both is gonna be it's gonna be good that there's going to be interest basically what they said more correctly is that there's going to be interest in both and that Richard Hart said that he wants to have a high price or hex on all chains now uh to me I don't know if that makes sense to me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,okay let's see how it's gonna happen like my spontaneous way of thinking about this is that e hex is gonna be uh like the old hex which is not not as relevant anymore but who the hell knows who the hell knows what you need to know is that if you have hex on eth you also now hex have hex on pulse so if we this is this is for you to think about yourself like do you think that e hex and hex what kind of ratio there is going to be I think it's super fascinating I don't know my initial reaction would be that one of them will be like v x and the other one kind of Fades away like Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash or Ethan ethereum classic but this is not what hex Community says to me so I'm here as a as an observer you can say as an observer of this ecosystem of hex so they probably know better,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,but at the end of the day uh let's see let's see I mean sometimes if things don't make sense to me I'll just have to sit sit here and see how it plays out but anyway so you have e hex and the hex if you if you hold the hex on on if you now have automatically you get this okay so you get as many coins as you had on if now you have them on pulse okay so if you had 100 coins hex coins on um if now you have also 100 on pulse okay so this is like a normal Fork uh the question is how do you see them so let's go to the next question how do how do you see your your hex on pulse well if you go to scan.polstery.com you see the block Explorer and you can search your address here and you can check the problem is that you will not see them today because they're still uh they're still building the database for this block Explorer,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,so this block Explorer does not show the correct balances so that's why you probably will have to wait until tomorrow before you see all your uh tokens and everything from it because as you know all you get all the forks of all tokens,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,so you get the hex if you had some uni swap token like any air sequence you now have you now have a copy of it on on pulse and let's see if they have any value but you can tomorrow like when this warning Let me refresh but when this warning appear disappears that's when this block Explorer fully works and that's when you can see the the the balances uh so that's about hex and E hex I hope that makes sense let's move on to the next question which is about how much money did you make if you are a sacrificer and it's impossible to know because right now we can only know it partially but right now e hex has a USD price so this is what you see on crypto bubbles for example that it's uh the price now is this has a UCC price of this much now remember you have you have also hex on pulse and hex on pulse does not have USD USD price so why is it important because as you know people have sacrificed to get pulse okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,so for example I sacrificed to to get the pulse and now I want to of course know do they get more money back or like what what is the result now piles doesn't have a USD price because it's only trading on pulse x with these trading pairs basically you can trade from pulse to hex or from piles to this incentive token which I will explain also and to pulse X so pulse itself does not have a USB price it will soon because there is a bridge coming within 48 hours that will bridge eth and the stable coins from eth to Pals okay so soon there's going to be a USD price but already right now if we're thinking how much money did we make on pulse we can make some assumptions we don't know the price of pulse in dollars directly let me write that down so we follow the logic together here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,so this is how it is the price of PLS in USD is unknown we don't know it but the price of PLS in HEX is we know it because if you go to pulse X you see that one pulse chain PLS is worth this many hex tokens so we know this that let me see if I can change the color oh man okay anyway so the price of uh PLS in in HEX not on Hex in HEX and in USD is this okay now the price the price of hex in USD is unknown we don't know it but the price of eex in USD is known so as you remember the price of of e hex is known it is this where is it didn't I write it oh yeah it's here sorry yes it's up here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,so this this is the data we have that this is the price of e hex uh we don't know the price of hex on pulse but we can assume so if we assume let's let's say we assume that there is some correlation between price on of hex on eth and pulsion and I mean in my mind price on pulse should be higher than price on eth because hex on policies like the native hex it's like the hex now and E hex is a like a copy of it on eth and let's see how the game theory plays out but in my mind that in my mind like my assumption let's let's have scientific approach here and clarify assumptions hex on pulse should be more expensive than hex on if I don't know if this assumption is good I think it's good let me know in the comments if you agree but I assume that pulse hex on pulse will be more than hex on eth and therefore more expensive than this Price,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,Right Here 0.0337 USD okay because that's the price of hex on eth so given all of this like what the hell is the result okay based on assumptions above TLS is at least how many dollars well you know how many hex one PLS is it is this and then if we just assume that the lowest price of hex is this because that's how much a e hex is worth then let's see how much is this zero point let me just copy this it is this okay uh now if I compare to My Sacrifice price My Sacrifice price let me write it here and this is different for different people depending if you sacrifice to the charity or what you sacrificed and by the way write your sacrifice price in the comment section uh so let's see so my Sac price is 0.0001 okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,so based on the simple calculation with the simple assumptions before I mean without having a bridge without knowing anything for certain I'm up 3x based on this based on this assumption because this is my cyclist price this is the price the current market price of pulse measured in hexon piles but we don't know the the price of dollars in dollars of hex and pulse we can only assume there's going to be more than the price of e hex on it which is right now this so that's why it should be at least a 3X but who the hell knows okay it's early on now finally many people are asking like what is this dollar this dollar number right here is not correct so don't ignore it I think Brett upset it as well that is not correct so ignore it this is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,I think they copied the code base from Union Swap and Union swap looks at die contract but die contract is not correct like usdc all the stable contracts they're not they're just copies they don't have one dollar value for each for each coin so that's something to keep in mind so on that note this is some general information about the launch um I hope it makes sense listen I hope you learned something I hope you understand a bit more of what else is happening but one thing is for certain it's I mean it's new territory let's see to me it doesn't really make sense that both hex and E hex is going to have value but uh let's be humble let's see what else happens let's just observe um tomorrow we should have way more clarity and the biggest Clarity is Gonna Come when there is actually a bridge from east to to pulse so you can take real stable coins from east to pulse you can take eth from east to pulse,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
l79506sWDIg,and um until the halving I don't have a lot of expectation for this market in terms of Bitcoin but in terms of alts absolutely absolutely there's going to be so much and of course we're going to add pulse to Morales money it's coming next week once we have the bridge working we can add it that's what that's when that that's when we can uh so we need the bridge and the bridge is gonna come within the next 48 hours as far as I know on that note guys hope you enjoyed Smash Up the like do it right now see you all tomorrow live as always have a good day and goodbye guys goodbye goodbye goodbye,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gXQpX2kObJg,hey what up guys welcome back to my channel and today we're going to talk about a theorem smart contract security and this video will be very useful for you as an IC o---- investor if you have no technical knowledge at all if you have never program the program before I will give you a way to assess the security of a smart contract so that you can take your IC o---- project the project that you the projects that you are interested in take their code and get a very rough idea of how these contracts are doing when it comes to security of course if you don't have that much knowledge you will only get a rough idea but that is still much much better than not having any idea at all also if you are a development team or if you are a smart contract developer yourself I will give you a way to improve the security of your smart contracts and I will give you a way to make sure that the security precautions are a part of your development process and how you can take that in and bake it in to your continuous continuous integration routine so guys without further ado let's get into it so smart contract security is such a huge huge topic and it's also important because nowadays whenever we hear about the Dow hack or when we hear about the parity hack or when we hear about any of these huge hacks that happen in the etherium sphere whenever someone who has never touched a theorem before reads about these hacks when mainstream media writes about these hacks it's very easy for,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gXQpX2kObJg,the repo I recommend this site called Sakura Phi dot CH so Sakura Phi dot CH I'm in Norway interoperation with Sakura Phi this video is not sponsored by Sakura Phi I just think that this service they are providing is very useful for you and it's free so if you are an SEO investor I would recommend recommend you to go to Sakura Phi that CH and you will see that here you can enter copy/paste a smart contract and here you can formally verify that smart contract so if we just press we see that it found a couple of errors and the lines that contain the errors are marked in red so we see that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gXQpX2kObJg,okay here we have a problem and here we have a problem as well to get more information about these problems we can scroll down and if I move myself we can see that here is where we get some more information more description about what actually was wrong in the in this code so for example on line six we have missing input validation and that means that we're not checking that this input amount is correct so as we can see this smart contract is acting as a bank where people can deposit and withdraw funds and so if someone deposits a negative amount which of course should never be possible it shouldn't be possible to deposit minus ten dollars but currently it is possible because we are not checking so if someone would call this function deposit with a negative amount that would actually decrease ones balance and that should never ever happen,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gXQpX2kObJg,yes so if we just check so that amount is larger than zero and we put the code inside of the function in this condition and we formally verified we see that we see that the error is now gone and this and as an IC o---- investor as a non-technical person as we mentioned it will be very very hard for you to actually understand what's wrong but what I suggest you to do is just count the red line see how many red lines there are and that will give you a very very rough estimate of how well this this code is written is it written by somehow who is just experimenting with solidity and never really develops really solid easy before then you might see many red lines or if there is a professional team developing you might see fewer lines because the thing is is it it is easy to write solidity code that works but that is not secure so it's very easy to write code that works and if someone has programmed in Java or JavaScript and they just arrived in solidity they will be able to write smart contracts but by using this tool you as an IC o---- investor actually have the opportunity to make sure that the projects you are investing in have professional developers who are not making these very very basic mistakes that this tool will will point out for you so secure Sakura Phi that CH is the tool number one of course on a more practical note as much what you do is you go to github and you find your project that you're interested in and that you're planning to invest in and you take some of their contracts and you paste them here and you count the red lines that mine might sound very trivial that you're just counting red lines but this is my recommendation I would definitely recommend a non-technical person to paste a contract and count the red lines and somehow get a picture of the quality of the code so this was the part of the video where we discussed how you as a non-technical person may be an IC o---- investor can make sure that the code is more or less well written and that a professional has written it now I want to show you another tool that anyone who has some kind of technical knowledge can use so thing is you don't have to use Sakura Phi if you have technical knowledge you could use or went instead I'm not sure how you pronounce it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gXQpX2kObJg,but so this tool is a Python script which you can run from your command line and you basically write Python or enter that PI and then you give it a contract file,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gXQpX2kObJg,and so what this tool will do is that it will take your contract compile it down to machine code to bytecode and then it will build a float flow graph of your program basically it will build a representation of your program in such a way that this script will be able to see which states your program can be in so it's a very very useful tool because you can use it from the command line of course it's not user friendly if you have if you don't have technical knowledge you will not be able to use it but the good thing with with it being a terminal tool a command line at all is that you can automate it and here is where I would very very much recommend development teams to put this as a part of your continuous integration routine whenever someone in your team pushes code to your repository make sure that you run the script on all of the commits that are being pushed and if it is the case that some developer pushes code that is not secure that this when the script would identify then this developer would for example get an email where I went with write the errors in the code and so that this developer can then resubmit a new version that is corrected and so you can also watch videos on Ont,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gXQpX2kObJg,I I know I have seen a very good one oh and the video yeah this one making smart contracts smarter is the name of the talk which I recommend you to watch it's a short one only 11 minutes and they basically explain the whole idea and issue they are solving with their script so guys to recap Sakura Phi if you have very little technical knowledge you just want to copy and paste a contract and roughly see the errors and how many errors there are in a contract and when the if you are a development team,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gXQpX2kObJg,and you want to take this and make a part of your development process and make sure that no commits is pushed or no pull request is being merged into your main branch without this tool verifying all of the smart contracts and that is because I think we all have the responsibility of writing very very secure smart contracts decentralized applications so that's it for today guys leave your comments in the comment section below whether you have other tools because once again get I'm not sponsored by Ont I'm not cooperating with Sakura five you could use either of them or you could use something else the point I want to make is that you should use some kind of tool you should really really take this seriously because using these tools the piracy hack could easily be avoided or or if someone I mean it's just this issue we're having currently that security is not really being taken seriously in my view that's it guys thank you very much for watching and if you are any viewer and you like boch chain technology is Tyrion Bitcoin programming you should definitely subscribe to this channel because you will find this channel interesting I myself am a software developer and I'll see you guys next time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
i5NTKh-MNH8,hey what up guys welcome back to my channel and today we're going to talk about github and why it's so important for you as they cryptocurrency investor basically whenever you're investing in a cryptocurrency you are investing in a technology product and you're investing in a technology team and by understanding how github works how we can use github you can yourself make a picture of how this project is doing other people actually developing this project is this project alive are the funds raised actually used for development and because many of these projects are open source many of the cryptocurrencies are of course all open source there is a way for you to take a look and look at the codebase and see for yourself how the project is doing and this is exactly what I'm going to teach you today of course get the technology of git is there's a lot to cover and we're only going to cover the basics today but by watching this video you will be able to take a look at a project like this Bitcoin and see for yourself how this project is doing and before we start guys I want to advertise our new cryptocurrency community on slack so if you take a look in the in the description you will see an invitation link to this community why should you join guys well because this is a community where we share our knowledge with each other because we have so many competence and on this channel we have people who are good in prices who do technical analysis people who understand the blockchain technology very well and here we can meet and we can exchange our knowledge our passion together and build this cryptocurrency community together and anyone who is remotely interested in cryptocurrencies will be able to come here and get value get questions answered and for example if you're interested in the technology we have this channel for a Tech Talk where you can ask people about different cryptocurrency projects and I'm sure we will have someone who will be able to help you we have price discussion so we talk about the prices we have introduced yourself where people are basically introducing themselves if you're new to the community you should go here write about yourself and introduce yourself and we have already 558 members which which is insane because this this little group started just a day ago,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
i5NTKh-MNH8,yeah Friday night it was so look at in the description below and click on the link if you are interested so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
i5NTKh-MNH8,"yeah it's back to github when I think you should understand the basic concept of git and that is the commits so what is a committee a committee is the basic is a very basic thing in a git technology when whenever you are coding something it doesn't have to do any anything to do with cryptocurrencies if you're working on a programming project and you do some kind of change it allows you to do a commit and a commit is basically a change to the code base and by using it by using the commit feature we as a programming team we as a development team we build up the series of commits and as you can see github has 14,000 commits more than 48,000 commits and if we click on them we we can see a list of all of the different committees that ever happened to Bitcoin and as we mentioned a commit is something that developers do when they have a feature completed or if they did a small fix basically there is no there is no specific rule that you should commit every hour or usually commit whenever you have a new feature each team has their own commit policy but basically a commit is a change to the code base and here we can see all of the commits and also if we click on the hash number of each of the commits we see exactly what this commit changed in the code base so for example it removed this line set key pulled that clear",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
i5NTKh-MNH8,and it's instead inserted these two lines in this particular file wallet that cpp and so by looking at the difference between the old file like the old code base to the left and the new code code base to the right with exactly what this committee did and an awesome picture of git is that we can go back to any of these commits basically we can reset the code base to any of this previous commit which is very useful because if we have a commit which does some kind of damage maybe we have a new developer who hasn't learned the code base yet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
i5NTKh-MNH8,and he made a mistake but it still got committed and we can reverse this change and we can go back in time and reset the code base to a another commit that happened earlier so now that you know what commits are we can talk about the contributors so contributors are people who have ever pushed a commit to Bitcoin or to any other like in this case it would be Bitcoin because we're looking at the Bitcoin repository but if we can look at these contributors in any other repository so if we open any repository we will be able to see who has ever committed code to this repository and here we can see a timeline of the contributions and we see that the project is doing well people are contributing to to and people are rising code for a Bitcoin and we see it in this overview timeline here at the top and by scrolling we can see which people contributed how much contributions and during which time so this way we have an overview of the general timeline here but also who contributed how much and when by scrolling and by using these two simple metrics basically looking at the commits taking a look at this list seeing that all right the latest commit was July 15th like the latest commit happened on July the 15th and today is July the 16th meaning that everything happened everything we're seeing here under commits on July 15th happened yesterday which is of course very very good meaning that this project was recently updated and we see that the river commit on July the 14th and on July the 13th and on July the 12th so every single day it seems like people are actually pushing code to get to Bitcoin and things are happening in these projects and so we had July the 12th we have July the 11th July the 10th so as you can see guys almost every single day people are pushing code to Bitcoin this project is very well alive this project is getting developed it has a good community of developers who are pushing code and my personal opinion that this project is doing just fine,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
i5NTKh-MNH8,and these two metrics basically looking at the commits here and looking at the contribute contributors here is what I would use if I was completely new to github if I didn't know how how it worked I would just start by looking at the committees and the contributors to get my own overview of the project how the project is doing and if you are more professional of course you can go here you can look at the actual code changes and you can see alright this commit change it change this to that some seems that there are some refactoring going on and the you can have a more technical overview but these are the ways I recommend for you as a critical investor if you don't have any technological knowledge just look at the dates just go here take a look at the date July 15th seems that people are working on it and the same thing by going here you can see that people are contributing the project is doing well now guys there is something I want to show you namely chain coin and why I think you should be careful because first of all if we look at the commits click here we see the last commit was on July the 14th and it might seem like a major thing like it was two days ago but this this change was this is very insignificant they basically changed the product name for from dark coin D to chain coin D and the file description from this is not a change I wouldn't even count this as a real commit and the same here is here what is what is that toolbar,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
i5NTKh-MNH8,all right this wasn't even the code to change this was a resource change they replaced some kind of image so yes this looks bad this looks really bad from a geat point of view if you're looking at at the project and the same if you look at the contributors you see that the contributions basically stopped entirely in 2013 and now we've seen some contributions here but they seem to be very very insignificant like what is this copyright year they changed the year from 2015 to mm the Teva n-- code changes these are some basic label changes and new icons right so guys be very careful I don't know there is this hype with this coin I don't really understand it it was also forked from Zetas coin which is another project basically they took the code from the Zetas coin and continued developing and that occurring in turn took the code from Bitcoin so when we fork a project we just copy it and make our own copy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
i5NTKh-MNH8,and then we continue developing on our own as a separate project and that is why if we look at for example if you look at chain coin here and we take a look at the country beauties here and we remove this filter link if I want to do this we see that these are is exactly the same people as in Bitcoin well if we if you take a look at the profiles we have this person and he's also here and you might be wondering guys how come this person works on chain coil but in reality he doesn't because the chain coin was a fork from Zee coin which turned work from Bitcoin meaning that the commits that this person has done in Bitcoin this person they are still counted as commits in a chain coin because chain coin is a fork of Bitcoin so that is why if you look at the github it's basically empty I'm sure who is working on this and that's it for today,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
i5NTKh-MNH8,yes you now know how you can build your own picture of a trip the currency of a programming project because guys this doesn't only apply to cryptocurrencies you can basically assess any programming project by looking at the commits by looking at the contribution tribute errs and you can get a rough picture is it going well or is it doesn't it going well it doesn't my English doesn't work today so that's it for today guys thank you thank you very much for watching and if you are a new viewer and you like cryptocurrencies programming technology you should definitely subscribe to this channel guys because you will find it interesting I myself am a software developer and I post videos every single day except sometimes I miss a day or so I'll see you guys tomorrow,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RI4n6tQims4, welcome back guys and today we're going to discuss one of the most common scams and most common frauds when comes to crypto influencers and I'm talking about a specific type of influencers that are trying to convince you that they are really really good at making money encrypted they're really really good at picking the winners even in the bear market they're really really good at knowing exactly what to buy and what to invest in and most commonly they try to they're trying to convince you to buy something they want so they tell you hey this is the great opportunity of this month so buy this coin or they try to convince you to join some kind of paid email group where you will be getting signals about good coins to buy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RI4n6tQims4,but they claim will go to the moon and the way they try to convince you is by showing you their finance for example they show you their bi'ness accountant and say hey look at my performance look at how much I've gained or they show you their block folio or they show you their Kraken or some other website where everything looks amazing this is the best portfolio you have ever seen and it all looks real I mean I want to be very very clear we're not talking about screenshots we're talking about they showing you a real website like this now it is just the crypto prices but imagine that this is a portfolio and they're showing you their portfolio and they are saying to you hey look at my bittern gains look at my video games and it all looks amazing but it's all fake it's all fake and today I'm gonna show you how we can make these numbers instead of red we will make them green instead of minus 1% we will make it plus 60% or plus 600% and you'll see how easy it is to manipulate a website like this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RI4n6tQims4,and this is something that happens very very often I cannot communicate to you how many people fall for this because they do not understand how easy it is to manipulate a website it is extremely easy and the website will look like a real website once again it is not a screenshot we're talking about everyone in our society in our culture by now understands that it is very easy to panic manipulate an image that is common knowledge even my grandma knows that you cannot trust an image but not many people know that you cannot truly trust the website either that someone shows you so let's let's make this portfolio look better and once again imagine that this is my portfolio imagine that this is not just prices but this is actually my portfolio so the first thing that I want to do is the following I want to change the number so instead of one point three negative one point three red I want this to be green so I right click this is in Chrome by the way so if you have Google Chrome which this tutorial will be for you right click,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RI4n6tQims4,and you click on inspect now this is in Swedish but in English it should be inspect here at the bottom and so when you click there you will get this little panel and if you right-click exactly on this number it will tell to take you to the actual element in the HTML code that is responsible for drawing this particular number and you can you know by hovering over different elements here in the code you can see that they're responsible for different elements on the screen and so the good thing with Google Chrome and all browsers all modern browsers nowadays is that you can directly manipulate the different elements so let's say that I want to make this portfolio look very good and very green I basically check I'm looking for this number minus 133 and I can find it here so let's change this to you know maybe I want to tell my I want to tell my followers that I actually made a two hundred and fifty four percent gain like this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RI4n6tQims4,and you can see the number changes the number changes without any problems and now I can actually close this and the website I mean this is the website it is like it was before you can show it to people people can look around but of course now it is red and it says - I don't want that I wanted to say plus I want it to be very very green so we need to do some changes here first of all we need to find how can we remove this percentage you know this - thing and you know by hovering you can see that you know it is actually this element right here that is responsible for drawing the percent the minus sign well obviously we don't want that so now it is it is no -,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RI4n6tQims4,but it is still red and that's obviously a problem so we can change this very easily it is not a hard thing to do you see that we can add our own code in this element that style section so by clicking here you can just go and say color like this and you put : boom and you type you know actually want this to be green like this boom green and let's hide this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RI4n6tQims4,and you know now it actually looks amazing and that is how easy it is guys I hope you now know that never trust when someone just shows you a website and they claim that the numbers on that website or real because you can change everything on the website you can change the numbers the colors you can change even the structure of the website if you want to and it will look like the real website it will have like coin based calm or binders that come to main name and for you it will be very hard to see the difference and really hard for you to detect so be aware beware be aware however you say it and know that nobody can predict the future nobody knows what the next big thing is in the Krypton markets and always always think for yourself use this what is this this is your head it is there for a reason so you use it anyway guys thank you so much for watching smash the like and I'll see you all very very soon goodbye goodbye,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs, what is going on guys welcome back to my channel and today we're going to talk about web mining so you might have heard the news that some people can buy ads on YouTube and whenever you watch their ads they will be running cryptocurrency miners on your computer through the YouTube ads or you might have read the news that Starbucks sometimes is able to run cryptocurrency miners on your computer if you connect to their Wi-Fi,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs,so how is it possible how are they able to do that well today is exactly what we're going to talk about that is exactly what we're going to discuss and they will show you how they do it also I want to thank and reward everyone who has notifications turned on and if you look in the description you'll find the link to get 50% off on the iPhone on tech Academy and only the 21st people who use it will be able to do so because then it will become invalid and the reason why you should enroll guys is because you will really get a solid understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology you will understand how blockchain will revolutionize real estate accounting insurance and so on and so forth even industry such as music and movies you will really understand how Bitcoin works under the hood how theorem works under the hood you understand them concerns those algorithms mining and so on and so forth so if you are an investor who wants to understand the investments better or if you are an entrepreneur who wants to start businesses or if you are an educator and you want to educate people well you need to be in the Academy I'll see you there guys and that being said let's get into it and talk about web mining,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs,so how can I make you mine how can I make you use your hardware and mine for me well first of all we have to understand that I need some how to run JavaScript code in your browser somehow I need to get a piece of JavaScript code which we will together construct later in the season and I need to run it on your computer and there are several ways to do it for example if you are visiting a coffee shop and you're using their Wi-Fi they will show you a website like this welcome to our Wi-Fi you have this many megabyte of this menu megabyte left,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs,and maybe you need to accept their terms and conditions and so when they're showing you that little page they are able to execute JavaScript because that page can have JavaScript logic or in the case with YouTube in the case where people were able to execute the miner through YouTube ads they were able to do so because the YouTube ad had a JavaScript code in it so it's all about can I get a piece of JavaScript code to execute on your computer and that is exactly what we're going to take a look at right now so if we look at the web site we see that it is very simple and even if you're not a programmer I think you kind of understand what it means but here we have the labels welcome to my Wi-Fi you have three megabyte out of a hundred and so here I can start adding script I can start adding javascript code and for example what can I do I can do an alert like like this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs,so if I execute that you see that it show it shows the alert but we don't want to do that instead we want to hear create a minor and the cool thing is that we don't have to build everything from scratch there is a service called coin hive calm if you go to coin half.com you'll see this website and the coin hive basically lets you embed a Mineiro miner on your website using javascript and as we can see here it's not only about tricking people into running your website and thus running the miner in the background there are actually legitimate use cases for this technology for example you know that adblocks is a very very popular technology nowadays and many people use ad locks so one way to monetize your website could be to run a cryptocurrency miner and you tell the users that either you turn off adblock and you watch ads or you mine cryptocurrency in the background and so the user has a choice and the user is aware also you can use this mining as spam protection for example if you have some kind of action that users can do on your website that you do not want the users to abuse well you can make them mine cryptocurrency for two to five seconds before they can perform this action again thus preventing spam or you can monetize links or you can create some kind of reward in an online game and so on and so forth so as you can see this technology can be used for good,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs,but it also can be used for evil if you just put it on your website the users are not aware and you're just draining their battery draining their computer of all energy so how can you how can you actually use it sorry guys well you press on this blue button integrate coin five you'll have to sign up so you'll have to create an account but once you are here you will see the dashboard like this and you will see the statistics for your for your mining but it is all zero when you look at it for the first time I have been playing around with this so you see some numbers here but when you come here it should be all zero and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs,so how can we this website that we have going on right here and make it mine well it's quite simple as you will see you go to documentation and then you go to JavaScript minor and here you'll get your code so first of all you need to include this library put it here in the header section in the head section when you copy this and the default rules the default default logic is that it will check so that we so that this code is never running on a phone so that if the user accesses the website on the phone this code will not be running but we can remove that if we want because if we're doing this for evil we don't care I mean we just want to mind when they're away we don't care if the user is mining on the phone or if the user has opted out of this thing we just want them mind Manero but if we're using it for a legitimate use case then we will probably have something like this that the user should not be on the phone and that if they have opted out then we do not run it but let's just for the sake of this video ignore that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs,and we will just start mining so here we create the miner and we need to provide the site key oops we need to provide the site key and you can do that by going to settings sighs and API keys and here you will see a site key so just copy this and paste it here like this and when you save it and we refresh the page well you see we have a pop-up that this website wants to mine using our computer now of course if you're doing this as legitimate use case you may want to show this pop-up but currently we want to learn how Starbucks did it or how these people using YouTube ads did it because clearly they didn't show a pop up that will make the this hack pointless because the users would know that something is going on and so in order to fix this we just need to replace this URL right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs,so if we replace this URL with this little URL that I have prepared just replace the origin of the library to this one and we save it will have the same functionality as the old one but it will just not ask the user for permission and now if we refresh you see now we start mining without any signs to the user and as I said this is only for educational purposes you should always ask the user and if you go now back to dashboard and refresh let's see if we see progress yes we see so you see it's going up you have 7000 i refresh again let's let's wait for a few or few seconds so I see is going up so my website is actually mining Manero currently and if I have many people visiting this website well I will get more Manero because more people will mind so let's just see if it increases even more which it should,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U556vsDPFrs,yeah you see it goes up so that's it guys that is how simple it is to embed a small minor on your website is literally one two three lines of code with JavaScript and if you use this service coin hive you will get a nice dashboard seeing exactly how much you mine and so on and so forth and this is our website that looks innocent but is mining cryptocurrency so guys thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed manage the like button smash the subscribe button and the Bell button so that you're always up to date thank you so much for watching and if you are a new viewer you should definitely subscribe to this channel because you will find it interesting I myself am a software developer and I'll see you guys next time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA, hey guys what's going on jeb here in today's video i am going to be teaching you how to master cryptocurrency trading with three skill sets and six steps to take you from zero to hero and show you how you can profit in cryptocurrency markets guys by the end of this video you're to walk away with a much better understanding of how to make the most out of the volatility in bitcoin and cryptocurrency so that you can profit and make more money in this space if you enjoyed today's video make sure to hit that like and subscribe button but without much further ado guys let's go ahead and dive right on into it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,[Music] before we get further into the video let's talk about bibet the best and most reliable trading platform private is great about helping you stay up to date on real-time market fluctuations keeping you informed on what your crypto is doing your funds are securely stored in a multi-signature cold wallet this allows for collections and withdrawals to be made via offline signatures if you're looking for a great trading platform you can get connected by using our bybit affiliate link down below guys we're going to start with the first three skill sets the very first thing that you need to know before you move into trading are some basic skills and the first one of those is called fundamental analysis you might be wondering yourself jeb what is fundamental analysis and why should i care if i'm trying to do trading,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,well it's a very good question my friend fundamental analysis is going to come into play we go through those six steps i just mentioned here in a second fundamental analysis is understanding what makes a cryptocurrency tick it's understanding what makes a cryptocurrency project worthwhile fundamental analysis is when you go and you read the white paper you read the website or you look at the team behind a cryptocurrency fundamental analysis is reading the news on a cryptocurrency fundamental analysis is understanding developments around the cryptocurrency fundamental analysis is understanding the regulatory space around a cryptocurrency fundamental analysis is incredibly important and is one of two types of analysis that we're going to talk about to become a master cryptocurrency trader you first have to understand fundamental analysis why so that you're able to pick the right cryptocurrency for example if we scroll down here through coin market cap you will probably see some cryptocurrencies that you are a fan of but my friend i encourage you to never,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,and i mean never trade or invest in a project that you don't understand for example the majority of trading that i've ever done i've done on either bitcoin or ethereum because i'm very well versed in the fundamentals of these projects if you don't fully understand a cryptocurrency before you start trading or investing in it there's a high likelihood that something that you didn't see coming is going to come into play and mess up your trade you don't want that to happen so skill number one is learn fundamental analysis skill set number two is learn technical analysis which is what we specialize in here on this channel because technical analysis is the gate and key to trading in the same way a physicist needs to understand math and an interior decorator needs to understand color theory a trader needs to understand technical analysis is one of the basic skills for doing trading why is that well my friends if you're looking to make a trade on bitcoin and you're trying to long or short this market,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,and you don't understand the technical analysis then you're not going to understand where to enter your trade you're not going to understand where to put a stop loss and you're not going to understand where to set your exit you're not going to understand your risk to reward ratio you're not going to understand all the factors in play for why bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency you're trading in is moving how it's moving and where it's moving it all goes back to the axiom if you don't know what you're investing in don't invest in it it's the same thing about trading if you don't know what you're trading on do not trade on or with it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,so skill set number two is to learn technical analysis by the way we teach technical analysis in the cryptocurrency technical analysis academy in the description box down below i spent like three or four thousand hours learning technical analysis and just so you know if you work 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year you will work 2080 hours a year i've spent a very long time learning technical analysis and i'll teach you all about it with the first link in the description box down below the third skill set of course that you need to learn is how to trade duh more specifically though you need to understand how to set up a trade if you're on trading view then there is a button right over here that you can use to grab something called a long or a short position if you are entering into a long trade then you can plan out your trade as follows let's say that i want to enter a trade on bitcoin at thousand five hundred dollars based on the technical analysis that i did earlier let's say then that i want to put a price target at sixty three thousand dollars as that's just below a level of resistance that i've identified through my technical analysis and let's say i want to put my stop-loss right here around fifty nine thousand five hundred dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,so when i say your third skill set needs to be understanding how to set up trades i'm not even so much you need to understand how to trade because that's what i'm teaching you what you need to understand is how to use trade setups and that's what i just showed you that functionality over on trading view or probably on the exchange that you're using we recommend buy bit you will find functionality just the same remember guys the skill set you need to understand is setting up trades that's where is your stop loss where is your entry price and where is your price target i don't have time to go into all that in today's video but you need to study it there's your assignment okay now let's use those three skill sets and walk through the six steps to setting up and executing a profitable trade number one you want to make sure you're trading the right cryptocurrency so you're going to use that fundamental analysis that you learned in skill set one you're gonna look through coin market cap,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,and you're gonna say okay i understand the fundamentals of bitcoin i think the fundamentals of bitcoin are great,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,i don't think there's going to be some kind of curve ball that's going to come in and wreck my trade i'll give you an example of a curveball that can wreck your trade when xrp had charges brought against it by the securities and exchanges commission that would almost certainly have wrecked your trade you don't want to be in a cryptocurrency that is going to put you at risk for that so step number one is to use your fundamental analysis on different cryptocurrencies and only trade a cryptocurrency that you believe has strong fundamentals step number two is what this channel does quite a lot of and that's doing technical analysis on the project before you can set a trade up you need to understand what the technical analysis says on a market and guys when i'm doing analysis this is what it ends up looking like most the time but you don't need to go that crazy you can get started with some basic support and resistance level understanding the kind of thing that we teach in ct-2a,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,so number one pick a coin with strong fundamentals based on fundamental analysis that's why you need to know fundamental analysis step number two use technical analysis to figure out what's going on on the cryptocurrency so that you can move into step number three which is to decide based on that technical analysis which direction not how far but which direction the cryptocurrency is likely to move next for example if i'm looking at this market on ethereum and i look at my technical analysis i can see that rsi is trending to the upside we're about to see a bullish cross on macd we just saw a volume spike on the daily chart we just broke resistance at 1 741,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,i believe that the market is about to move up that step number three is discern which direction you think the market is going to go which leads me to my fourth point which is deciding where the market is likely to move to first of all you ascertain where it's likely to go as far as direction now we want to figure out where it's likely to go as far as price based on the analysis that i can see on this ethereum chart i think that ethereum is going to rally a little bit above two thousand dollars that's my price target on ethereum if we press play here we can see that that's exactly what it did ethereum rallied up to around 2150 which is actually the exact price target that we said on this channel we said 2175 dollars a couple weeks ago it went to 2150.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,after you've decided which direction you think the market is going to move and you've decided where you think the market is going to move to now you need to set up a trade and guys this is a step that people skip all the time normally people follow step two three and four sometimes they'll skip step one and they'll trade on whatever and then they'll get wrecked because they're in the bad project and they shouldn't be trading number 457 over on coin market cap sometimes people skip step one,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,but so many people skip step five and i'm warning you if you skip step five kiss your chances of being a profitable trader goodbye guys i've made hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars in cryptocurrency i've been working here for years just trust me that's what i'm saying just trust me don't skip step number five here's step number five use a trade setup i mean on literally every single trade always use a trade setup that's step number five if we go back to this hypothetical market i'll show you how i would have set a trade setup for this trade i would have put a open price right here around eighteen hundred and ninety dollars right above my level of resistance i would have put my stop loss somewhere here in the middle around 1800 and then i would have put my price target just a little bit above 2050 because that was a little bit below where i thought the market was going to go pro tip if you think the market's gonna go to say 2 200 i would encourage you to set your exit around 21.50 because oftentimes what you'll find is the markets will rally close to the level of resistance but sometimes they won't quite get there and you want to make sure that you actually get the trade to exit when you want it to you don't want to get two dollars away from the exit and then it not trigger and then you're just sol so guys always remember to use a trade setup let me break down the three parts of that you have your exit price you have your open price and you have your stop loss your exit price is the place you're going to sell hopefully in profit your open price is where you're going to enter the trade so if we're gonna enter a trade on ethereum at two thousand dollars two thousand dollars is our entry price our exit price is where we think it's going to go to that's where we're going to get out of the trade and take our profit and our stop loss protects us in case the market goes too far to the downside we always want to use a stop-loss sometimes people don't use stop-losses sometimes people argue with me and say oh jeb i don't need a stop-loss if you don't use a stop-loss you're making a mistake not even going to argue about it it is packed it's just easy seriously it's just stop loss do yourself favor use a stop loss stop loss is where you exit the trade in case the trade is getting too bad to lower the risk of losing a ton of money it is how you calculate risk to reward ratios after all which we talk about all of that more in the academy linked in the description box down below if you want to learn more i can't condense 12 hours of content in c2a down into a 10 minute video and get all of it in here so learn more down there but that leads us to step number six and i'll start step number six by quoting none other than dwight d eisenhower who once said plans are useless but planning is indispensable what does he mean by that well guys at the end of the day sometimes you'll make a plan in life and the plan will not go to plan sometimes you're going to make a plan and you're going to realize halfway through the plan,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,okay i actually need to do this in a completely different way what dwight d eisenhower was saying former general of the during world war ii and former president of the united states was saying is that plans are useless because they might need to change but the act of planning is indispensable why because once you've thought about something you are prepared for it what's the boy scouts motto be prepared what my dad always tell me know your song well before you start singing know what you're doing before you get into it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,so that's step six use wisdom and realize that the trade setup you just made and all the technical analysis you just made it's very important you follow those steps but if something has to change on the fly then use your expertise in trading to make sure you can do that don't get yourself locked into a plan that may end up putting you in a bad situation just because you want to be 100 stuck to your plan if things need to change things need to change that's where wisdom comes in if anyone doesn't know what wisdom is i will boil it down to one word experience either your own experience or experience you've learned from someone else that's really what wisdom is keep to the plan for as long as is wise but if you need to go off script don't get too concerned about doing so so guys those were the three skills you need you need to know fundamental analysis you need to know technical analysis and you need to know how to set up trades all three of which we teach with the link in the description box down below and the six steps of trading are as follows number one pick a coin with strong fundamentals pick a coin with high volatility and a high volume make sure that you're in a cryptocurrency that's not gonna throw you a curve ball step number two do technical analysis on this coin and understand what the technical landscape what the charts of the coin look like step number three decide based on that technical analysis which direction the cryptocurrency is more likely to move and remember that you can never predict anything with certainty it is all about probabilities there's a video in the course down below called the game of statistics and probabilities i explained more in that video step number four decide based on your technical analysis and which direction you think is going to move where you think it's going to move to in terms of price you think it's gonna go to two thousand dollars or three thousand dollars or twenty dollars or a hundred dollars where do you think it's going to go step number five use that skill set you built earlier and set up the trade and stick to it as long as you can and that leads us to step number six use wisdom all good traders understand what they're doing they're not looking for someone else to give them the answers they know the answers themselves because they are after all experts i want you guys become experts in trading because when you become an expert in trading the possibilities are endless you can make as much money or as little money as you want you can work as many or as little hours as you want you can do this guys i believe in you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hkUoj9IZ1bA,but it's not going to be easy and it's not going to come simply it is something you're going to have to work for and i'm not going to hand it to you on a silver platter not because i don't want to but because i can't you need expertise in this you need experience in this but i know you can do it guys if you want to learn more like i said the first link in the description box down below will teach you more so check us out down there if you enjoyed this style of video let us know in the comments section make sure to like and subscribe to the channel follow us on instagram and twitter but guys that is going to wrap it up for today's video before i go though i do just first want to thank each and every single last one of you for watching as always and i will see you guys in the next video peace i got a real good feeling,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,Academy so if you do enjoy today's video definitely consider dropping a like and hitting a subscribe button I'm not going to be doing a ton of these videos on the channel most of videos like this are in the course if you want to join the link is in the description but without much further ado let's go ahead and get right into it now guys this is a very simple trading strategy so this is not going to be a very long video in fact this is probably going to be a rather short video simply because this is so very simple now guys what you're going to need for this kind of trading strategy if you've watched a video that I've made in the last couple of months if you've watched several of my videos you probably run across me talking about this because I talk about it every time Bitcoin runs into a consolidation pattern so we don't really have much of a consolidation pattern to talk about here in today's chart,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,but we could in theory make some kind of consolidation pattern where we have an uptrend right there and then a downtrend right there we could draw that for a consolidation pattern if you will but that's not really the way I'd like to draw that market let's look at previous consolidation patterns because all you really need for this kind of trade is some kind of pattern be it a consolidation pattern it can be a flag it can be a pennant it can be a triangle pattern it can be any kind of pattern like that but it needs to be some kind of pattern that you would expect Bitcoin to break a bullish or bearish out of and in fact it can even be a trading channel so let's go ahead and get right into this what is it well if Bitcoin runs up here and breaks bullish and moves into this consolidation pattern where a breaks bullish and there's trading around up and down in this consolidation pattern and this consolidation pattern is long enough that we have our level of resistance defined and we have our level of support defined,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,well then there's a very simple trade that you can make and that trade is as follows you put a buy order right up here let's draw it a little straighter you put a buy order right up here for in case Bitcoin breaks out and you put a sell order / a short order down here in case Bitcoin breaks bearish now why does that constitute free money why does a trade that simple constitute free money well I'll tell you exactly why it constitutes free money if Bitcoin comes here and breaks bullish then as it did then you hit this sell order and I will talk about caveats so that's one of them right there in a second if Bitcoin comes up here and triggers this buy order excuse me then you bought your Bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,and then you get to let it ride until you decide you want to sell it later on after Bitcoin has rallied a little bit more and just in case Bitcoin brakes bearish then you have a sell order down here to protect yourself or a stop you have a stop-loss to sell what you've already what you're already holding so you sell the Bitcoin that you're holding and then you can buy back and lower or you may have the opening of a short position down here where you can start shorting and then close that short position somewhere lower where you see there being potential profit and where you see there being potential support so this is essentially free money I know I'm using that term kind of loosely but I never use it before and I never use it when it doesn't actually mean it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,and this is basically essentially free money because no matter which direction Bitcoin breaks out of a consolidation pattern like this let's go ahead and look at this one no matter which direction Bitcoin breaks out of this consolidation pattern right here whether it breaks the bullish or breaks bearish you're gonna make money because if you have a sell order down here then you can buy your Bitcoin back and lower in you're making Bitcoin because you're selling at a higher price and buying in a lower price same thing if you're shorting you're selling someone else's Bitcoin at a higher price and then covering it later at a lower price and pocketing the difference but a Bitcoin breaks bullish then you have your buy order right here it triggers and then the market goes up and then you get some Bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,and then you get to make some dollars you get to make some money you have to make some Bitcoin actually you don't necessarily have to make any Bitcoin your Bitcoin is worth more than you can sell it for more US dollars to buy more Bitcoin later and there's a really amazing thing to this and that is no matter which direction Bitcoin breaks here whether it breaks a bullish or Bitcoin breaks bearish you're covered and you're almost guaranteed to make money now there are a few caveats to this,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,and I'm going to show you guys what those are in a second so watch to the end of the video it is important you understand the entire scope of this because if you just set the straight up wrong you can't hurt yourself you can make it bad for yourself but if you have a buyer order up here right about the level of resistance and a sell order right down here below the level of support and you're keeping an eye on it if Bitcoin breaks bullish boom you have a buy order set you're gonna have some Bitcoin coming in you're not you're gonna excuse me not Bitcoin coming in you're going to be buying some Bitcoin with your dollars or whatever you're trading with euros,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,maybe and if Bitcoin brakes bearish then boom you're gonna be selling that Bitcoin and you're gonna be shorting that Bitcoin and you're going to be making Bitcoin on the way down if Bitcoin breaks out either bullish or bearish you're gonna make money the only way you don't make money here is if one of the caveats I talked about happen which you can cover or a bit quench rate sideways and doesn't actually do anything here and remember this isn't just Bitcoin we're talking about I'm just showing you this on the Bitcoin shark but you can do this on any market now there are a few caveats of this that you have to be careful about and one thing I would say is that if you're going to do a trade like this I would highly recommend and by the way this is not financial advice I'm simply showing you guys a setup that I use for trade sometime a caveat that you have to keep with this is false wix's so you look at what happened right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,see how if we were to have a buy order up here and then biklen would have bought we would have bought some biklen right here and then Bitcoin would have gone up and then falling back down you don't want that to happen because if you buy Bitcoin right up here and then it falls back down well great you just wasted a bunch of Bitcoin you just wasted a bunch of money you didn't make any money you lost money and that's not exactly what we're here to do I don't know about you,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,but I know of a lot more fun ways that I can go waste money than failing a Bitcoin trade you don't want to do that that's not what you want to do what you want to do is you want to be very careful and you want to watch this and to protect yourself against these kind of breakouts what you can do is that when the breakout is happening you need to you need to be there watching the breakout and after Bitcoin rallies through this buy order here's what you do you put a sell order right below it maybe 1% below it maybe a half a percent below it let's say Bitcoin was rallying here and then you bought Bitcoin in right here and then to protect yourself you put a sell order right there and then the only thing you're risking is the trading fee,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,so you're risking maybe point two five percent depending on what exchange you're on maybe 0.5 percent of your valuation total that's not a very big risk considering the kind of reward we're talking about here that's something we talked about the cryptocurrency technical analysis Academy we have an entire video dedicated to risk and reward in fact I think that was a first video I recorded for c2a so if you're interested in more on that check the link in the description but this is a really cool strategy right here waiting for Bitcoin to break bullish after you hit the buy order if you think bitcoins gonna continue you put a cell or right below it to cover yourself now that's kind of what we're doing on a larger scale right here where we see if we if Bitcoin breaks bullish and then we're good but then if Bitcoin does what happened on aetherium a long time ago for example Bitcoin breaks bullish and then falls back below,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,and then it goes bearish then we have a sell order down here to catch ourselves or a short order down there to cover ourselves just in case that happens when we show you an example of that an example that will be right over here where if we were to have our buy orders up here and our sell orders down here we would have awesome Bitcoin maybe we didn't decide to sell it yet maybe we wanted to wait for another leg up but we didn't get it Bitcoin crashes down and then we sell it right down here just a few percent below where we bought it so we're only risking 3 to 4% depending on the size of the market at any one time but we're also we're also we also have the potential of profiting a lot more than that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,so the reason I like this trade so much is that the risk to reward ratio is typically very high because normally when you're gonna see a bullish breakout of one of these consolidation patterns it's going to be a big one now that doesn't always happen sometimes you're just gonna see a Bitcoin breakout it's going to do something like that and then fall over and then do this kind of thing but a lot of times especially when you're in kind of the the Bitcoin bullish and bearish rallies thing that we had going on in 2018 here we're bit coming with rally bullish rally bearish really bullish rally bearish blah blah blah especially when that was happening and I do see a lot of that movement coming back it was much easier to make trades like this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,and it was much easier to ride these trades and have these trades hold out for a long time and wait for the profits to roll in because after you get a nice buy order you can hold that Bitcoin for a long time you don't have to sell it in 12 hours you don't have to sell it in 24 hours heck you can even roll it over to into your investing portfolio that's what I do with some of my failed trades so guys tell me in the comments section down below what you think of this type of content tell me what you think in the comment section down below of this trade because it's really interesting to me that every time we're going to go into a consolidation pattern I talk about this kind of trade where you have a buy order right above the breakout point and a sell order or a short order right below the the resistance level right below the bearish breakout point and it seems to me that in the comment section a lot of people are saying WOW jab that was a really cool trade you just set up there I've never even thought about doing that why have I never heard of that for I've seen a lot of people talk about that and wonder why they've never seen that before and I've had several people in the comment section I think of two or three examples of this off the top of my head where people wanted me to make a dedicated video on this so if you guys did enjoy today's video and definitely consider dropping a like and hitting that subscribe button one thing I do also want to touch on is the idea of a sell order here because of course you have to have some Bitcoin to be selling the Bitcoin so if you're trying to cover yourself with a sell order down here one of the easiest things you can do if you're trying to buy Bitcoin and sell Bitcoin the same time is to already have some Bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,so let's say you have 10 Bitcoin right here you would be you would have a sell order on that 10 Bitcoin down here while you have a buy order on 10 Bitcoin up here this works better if you're already holding some of the asset that you are trading that's just kind of one of the last things I want to talk about be very very careful always remember to be very careful with these kind of wix's right here that's why I do recommend you watch this kind of trade and always watch your trades anyway because sometimes you get fake outs I read the comments I read in the comment section that someone was doing a trade similar to this on this wicks right here and they had a bike over like right here somewhere and they caught the very top of it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,and they were not very happy about it that's why after you set a buy order like this you want to come in and cap it off with a sell order right below it because typically when you're seeing a bullish breakout of a longer-term consolidation pattern like this you're gonna see the bullish breakout and then it's not gonna come back down it's gonna rally it's gonna rally and then it might be a day or two later it might be a week or two later before Bitcoin comes back down below your buy order so it's normally okay to set that sell order down there normally you're not gonna get faked out trying to protect yourself from being faked out if that made any sense at all anyway guys I do hope you enjoyed today's video I do hope you got some value out of that tell me in the comment section down below if you'd like to see more videos like this I will be more than happy to upload a few more of them to the channel,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
o1f8lG5s7sg,but like I said normally this kind of content the kind of stuff where I'm talking about trades and I'm talking about the methodology for working in markets and the ways to make more money in the markets normally these kind of videos are going to be relegated to the cryptocurrency technical analysis Academy that link to check out what we have to offer is in the description down below we have 20 videos over 6 hours of content very very good course that I have spent a long time putting together and poured my heart and soul into it and the hundreds of people who have gone through the course seem to be very happy with the product we've never had a single refund happen we've never had a single refund and I think that's really awesome considering the amazing refund policy we have you check the FAQ then you'll find our refund policy there anyway guys that is basically going to do it for today's video I do want to thank each into every single one of you for watching as always and I will see you guys in the next video peace,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I, you know the culture we live in is so dominated by the words mine and now and no and i want this and i want it now and all of those words have the same root and that root is a controlling spirit so i want to talk to you today about what a controlling spirit would get you if you're not careful so i have found in my life that oftentimes when i have the most success is when i let go and you might wonder like yeah that doesn't make any sense why would letting go actually lead to you getting what you want why would giving up lead to you getting what you want well the funny thing is is that when we're controlling we start to demand and when we start to demand we stop to be as attractive to people i'm not talking about physically i'm not talking about romantically but i'm just talking about being around people there's like there's a there's a there's almost a law in society,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,it's almost a societal law that the more that you demand something of someone or or even of a society or even of a market the less likely it is that you're gonna get it and we've seen the exact same thing happen in cryptocurrency people demand they might not know it they might not say that word but what they're doing is they're demanding bitcoin you must rally right now because i need a larger portfolio net worth on my balance sheet well the funny thing is that law extends into bitcoin because all bitcoin is is the collective sum total of the consciousnesses of all the different people that trade in bitcoin cryptocurrency so when you're demanding with one person you're less likely to get what you want when you're demanding with the aggregate which is a cryptocurrency market then you're less likely to get what you want as well i'm here to tell you that in five years of working in crypto i have found that surrendering and saying what may come may come but i'm gonna do the best,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,that i can today is the most successful way to make money in cryptocurrency i'm fully thoroughly convinced that by demanding less you will actually achieve more and i'm going to tell you a couple reasons why the first reason is because it's going to cause stress and anxiety when you demand i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do this it causes this stress and anxiety because you put yourself on such a high pedestal you're so focused on man i need to be here yesterday and it's this hustle culture i propose a different solution instead of demanding oh we're going to do this we're going to do that we're going to do that there's nothing wrong with setting goals there's nothing wrong with being humble and working hard and having strategies but what i have found is that after you do that most of the work is actually in the process of being disciplined on the day-to-day improvements that you need to make so instead of demanding oh i demand a one million dollar portfolio in one year you don't know if that's going to happen it might happen in three months it might happen in three years i can pretty much guarantee if you work in crypto long enough hard enough and you have the funds to do it and you have the you know an internet connection you can make a million dollars in crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,i'm fully confident that just about anybody can make a million dollars in crypto barring you know a disability or literally having no access to the internet the question is are you going to be so demanding that you become so controlling that you become so anxious that you become so unmotivated that you quit are you going to be so controlling or are you going to say you know what let the weight off my shoulders and what may come may come but i'm going to do the best i can today there's a word this japanese that actually the idea comes from the americans the americans brought it over and the japanese brought it back with their wording on it it's called kaizen it's a core value of our company we don't talk about that much,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,but it's a mandate for continual improvement what that means is that we are striving to continually do better than we ever have before notice where the emphasis is on that the emphasis is not on the end the emphasis is on the golden goose the emphasis is on the thing that's creating the results you see one of the mistakes that a lot of people make in business and that we've made plenty of times in business is that we focus so much on you're gonna see how all this ties back together they focus so much on the end number this for example in our business the subscriber growth youtube revenue you know company revenue viewership watch time twitter followers what a total aggregate social media followers tick tock follow whatever you focus on the end goal instead of focusing on,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,okay we're going to produce this much content we're going to make one stream improvement a week we're gonna make sure that we have two cultural meetings a week i'm gonna make sure that i have three one-on-ones with three of my direct report instead of focusing on the thing that actually generates the results you focus on measuring the results so much that you think that's going to achieve it but measuring what you want does not get you what you want it just quantifies what you have after you've worked to get it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,and that's the mistake people making cryptocurrency because they're so controlling because they demand the result they put so much emphasis on oh this is where i'm going this is what i'm going to do this is what we're going to have and they've missed the thing that stephen covey talked about in the seven habits of highly effective people of the goal of the concept of the golden goose you know the story of the golden goose the golden goose lays golden egg every single day what most people do in their cryptocurrency life is they say i'm gonna get a golden egg i'm gonna get a golden egg i'm gonna get a golden egg i'm gonna get a golden egg and they're so focused on what it's gonna feel like to have a golden egg that they never go looking for a golden goose or after they have a golden goose they want all the eggs that are inside so they kill the golden goose thinking that there's a million eggs in there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,but there's not because it takes time it only makes one egg a day you got to have patience the patience ties back into all of this what's the analogy there the analogy there is one if you're new to cryptocurrency and you're focusing oh i want a million dollar portfolio that's the wrong focus that's great that's vision that's important it's motivation that's great i want you to have financial sovereignty not so you can buy a yacht so you can provide for your family your communities you can take care of yourself take care of others you know take care of the community et cetera one must the number one mistake people make is they focus so much on the end goal that they don't think about focusing on the thing that's going to get there in the moment everybody wants to do what i do but nobody wants to do what i did think about that that goes for anybody who's ever had any kind of success that people say i want to be like them you want to be like them,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,but you don't want to be going through what they went through to be like them stop focusing so much on this is a mistake i made for years stop focusing so much on the end result which is important instead focus on what it's gonna take to get there i used to sit in my room for eight or ten hours a day watching videos of supercars this is like four years ago we're talking about but it was before i was even a christian i used to sit in there watch videos of supercars and you know million dollar bill grant cardone ty lopez patrick david uh uh you know all these peter mckinnon all these different uh uh gary vaynerchuk all these different youtubers i'd be like i'm gonna be like them one day and i spent so much of my time saying i'm gonna be like them one day that i was not working to become like them i was so focused on saying yeah i'm going to be like that that i wasn't spending time to become like that because i wanted to do what they do,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,but i didn't want to do what they did which is work i'm not saying it's easy i'm not for a second saying it's easy i'm not one of these people that's going to oh well you just need to work harder if you're in a bad situation no sometimes you're genuinely in a bad situation and you need somebody to help so that's the number one mistake people make is they never get started because they're so focused on the end goal they sit there for a year and they think oh i'm gonna get closer to being in crypto because i've watched all these videos i like that you watch videos,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,it's very important that you educate yourself but if you don't apply it what's the point go out there and put the work in and two the other thing that people do is that they get a little bit of money they get a little bit of discipline they learn a few things and then what we do i say people i shouldn't say people i'm one of them i do this all the time it's a struggle and it always will be is we get something that's working but we want an even bigger golden goose we've got one golden egg we want an even bigger golden egg we got one egg a day coming in but that's not good enough because we want more we always want to grow we always want to be bigger we always want the next thing we say oh we don't want one golden egg we want two golden eggs but it's hard to find another golden goose what do we do we go and destroy the golden goose thinking,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,oh it's got a million golden geese in there what's my practical point here a lot of times we put our resources into trying to do something that is unproven and we take resources away from the thing that is proven i've done that many times where for example i'll give you i'll give you an example when i started the youtube channel we're talking what would this be uh early 2019 channel had i want to say about 15 20 000 subscribers i was generating revenue i was you know i was able to provide myself my family and everything and uh but there was a couple of bad months where i wasn't really doing a whole lot views were down revenue was down all this stuff was down and my wife my blind my mind started to wander and started making a shopify store i had a shopify store called untold wild i know i'm great at names huh i know i look like a wreck today i'm sorry and i almost almost stopped doing youtube because i thought the grass was greener on the other side i thought the grass was greener on shopify,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,because oh if i can just get some facebook uh uh you know free ads uh facebook ads working i can be making 60 000 a month and then boom i'm good two problems with that number one i didn't realize that i was never in youtube for the money i knew at the time i wasn't in youtube for the money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,but i guess i had forgotten that and two i was giving up my golden goose i was actually going to let my golden goose go to try and catch two of them how ridiculous is that principle in business i was taught by a mentor that worked in executive leadership at ford motor company the dudes he was on the c-suite of a 200 million dollar company a mentor of mine named bob he told me a business should never ever give up a profitable revenue stream to go and invest in an experimental revenue stream how does this apply to cryptocurrency sometimes what we'll do in cryptocurrencies we'll see there's like 15 ways to make money in crypto we do money we do nfts we can do trading we do investing we can do uh arbitrage we can do whatever it is we run a youtube channel we can make up we can start a company in crypto and we say okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,well i'm just going to give up on trading because investing seems seems better or i'm just going to give up on the youtube channel because i think i can make more mining or i'm just going to give up on nfts because i think that i can make more money in uh you name it whatever being a twitter influencer nothing wrong with any of those routes there is something wrong about jumping between them you're never gonna get anywhere if you're jumping between ships that are all going in the different direction you might get somewhere but not anywhere useful you got to pick something and stick to it that's why i tell people if you are going to be an entrepreneur being in cryptocurrencies entrepreneurship people ask me why do you talk about entrepreneurial and self-discipline and con and motivation and all that leadership content why do you do that because crypto is entrepreneurship that's what this is you're running a little one-man business one woman business that's what you're doing it is entrepreneurship if you're jumping around from ship to ship to ship you're not going to get anywhere,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bxJTklJpw8I,so i encourage you have patience understand that you need to stick with one thing for a while maybe years to see it work and understand that if you have something that's working stick with it hone it you know don't don't don't be that person that stays in college for 20 years and they jump around to 17 different majors and then they never graduate with a degree and then they sit there with all this experience that they can't do anything with because all the things they studied they needed the degree for but they never got it they can't go into law they can't go to medicine they can't go into sociology because they needed the degree and they didn't get one and they wasted their time they learned but as far as the goal of getting the degree they didn't get it think about how important mindset is it's actually far more important than you think it is and a lot of times it's one of the best investments you'll ever make peace,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dHR-krnrh-Q,here's a question that we had just normal chat siobhan goulet uh said why bitcoin considered risky i think why hold on why is bitcoin said a risky only put money you could afford to lose when it also compared to gold at the same time bitcoin is considered risky in the same way fire was considered risky in the same way automobiles were considered risky in the same way electricity was considered risky and trains were considered risky and planes were considered risky because most people don't understand it most people don't understand that it is solving one of the most existential problems that humanity has ever faced the inability to preserve wealth for a lifetime you can't do it there's no way to do it without bitcoin you think you can preserve wealth in real estate really with two percent property taxes in pretty much every single state you can but really the only way to preserve wealth is to keep making money it's very difficult without bitcoin to get out of that rat race you have to continue generating wealth or else you're going to slowly erode it you're going to thermal thermodynamically erode that wealth into the ether and it's going to be taken away by inflation which is the biggest silent tax that you don't even realize is happening to your dollar the reason people are scared of bitcoin is the same reason they were scared of any new technology you know people were scared of wi-fi this was 10 years ago people were scared of wi-fi because they thought he was gonna give them ear cancer that was a thing do you do you remember that tim am i crazy i remember that being a thing you're a little older than me do you remember that when wi-fi started becoming a big thing in bluetooth and wireless phones a lot of people thought that that was going to cause ear cancer listen i might not have been that far ahead of you my parents were very much behind the times when it comes to technology,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dHR-krnrh-Q,i i think literally we didn't have caller id on our phones until literally 2010 i think it was available in the 90s uh it yeah we were behind yeah but i might not believe that the point is every single time a new technology comes out because we are scared of change we get fearful of it people are scared of bitcoin and look i'm not attacking that i am saying most of their fears are unfounded though and i think it's important that we as bitcoin evangelists go out and we teach people what bitcoin is and truly why it was created in the first place which was to give us control of our finances back because that is the only place that that control is safe you know continuing that thought of evangelism and i'm trying to i'm i've been sitting here mulling over how i even want to like say this and i'll probably be able to articulate it better in a future video but here's what we have over the future especially wrapping this stream as we we're we're getting closer to wrapping up we still have like eight minutes here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dHR-krnrh-Q,but i want you guys to think about something bitcoin's price more than likely will eventually go up but here's why you should be concerned or excited if the retail investor does not get into the space and right now what we are seeing is retail investing looking into like google trends showing crypto searches is plummeting we see as even michael novogratz said like hey people are not going to invest in crypto or anything when their house is on fire and we need to pull them in the only other option for the bitcoin price to go up is due to what i said was another variable and that is regulation being clear and allowing the billions if not trillions of institutional monies to come into the space guess what that does that still moves the power of an amazing currency future future currency bitcoin into the hands of the powerful while the retail investors miss out what we need to do in following what jeb says is continue day in and day out to like evangelize what bitcoin's purpose is it's actually super cool getting to have conversations with people on the street in my family as their brains are starting to turn and they're starting to change,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
dHR-krnrh-Q,but if we don't continue to push if we don't keep our foot on the pedal a lot of people are going to start flooding out a lot of retail investors who are newer to this space are going to sell and say you know what i need to keep my us dollars for all of this uncertainty a lot of people who were considering sitting on the sidelines they're going to say you know what i'll hold off till next year and the problem is what happens there's a question i want to ask you what happens if retail investors stay on the sideline and institutions come in massively pumping it well over not just 69 000 but start pushing into the hundreds of thousands and it's a massively whale controlled space we need to as the everyday man as these people like we need to continue to keep our our foot on that pedal of evangelizing to the everyday person the what why bitcoin is so valuable and why they need to continue to have that longevity thought and not just say what's my instant gratification but what's my long-term gratification so that they don't flood out of the market and bitcoin doesn't suffer similar control issues that we saw happen with gold and other fl failed uh currencies that we've seen in the history so the point is trillions of dollars are going to be made in the cryptocurrency market,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

kjwGCajj7ZY, coinbase crypto.com trezor bitco venmo cash app ledger genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy oh that's the wrong list there are a lot of crypto wallets and they all seem to have advantages and disadvantages but which one is right for you in this video we are going to cover the practical differences between crypto wallets so that you can choose for yourself which is right for you if you just want to copy cat off the wallets that i use then you can go ahead and do that because i will reveal all of those in this video the landscape of crypto wallets is constantly changing as new wallets seem to pop up every single day some are safe some have high fees some have staking features and some are 100 scams if you are a beginner then this video is for you but know that i will also cover some more advanced concepts as we go but hey that's how we learn right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,and if you have a question just tweet me or leave a comment the best place to start when considering a crypto wallet is when you are most likely to use it and how frequently crypto wallets are digital systems that interact with a cryptocurrency's blockchain by using your stored private key to stake your coins check your balances and send your coins to other wallets you can use your crypto wallets as long as you have connection to the internet so your wallet can live on your mobile phone browser desktop or a physical drive you may have also heard of paper wallets but my team and i have heard too many horror stories about that technology not working out as intended think water damage ripping hungry puppies paper wallets were kind of a cool thing in the early days of crypto but like the dvd player they are just inferior technology let's start with the most common the mobile wallet if you are someone who's going to want to access your account multiple times a day then you may want to have your wallet accessible on your mobile device some examples of mobile crypto wallets include coinbase wallet exodus mycelium and trustwallet these wallets are all hot wallets meaning that they are constantly connected to the internet this constant connection is considered to be a higher security risk though the trade-off is that hot wallets make it very easy to check the value of your crypto in dollar denomination as well as quickly transfer your coins to an exchange to sell it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,yes an exchange is different from a wallet take coinbase for example there is coinbase the exchange and then there is coinbase wallet the wallet when a user buys bitcoin on coinbase exchange they do not exclusively own the bitcoin until it is transferred to their coinbase wallet this may seem confusing or impractical but i will touch on this towards the end of the video however put simply if you plan on holding cryptocurrency like bitcoin for a long period of time you're going to want to transfer it from an exchange into a wallet i have investigated it and to be honest the relationship between wallets and exchanges is actually a net benefit to the crypto world overall but moving on the web browser is also a very popular platform for wallets to live as you might guess this type of wallet can be accessed on the chrome browser in other browsers as well you simply download them as a plugin and then make an account and in most cases you will be able to use the browser wallet as a login key as you navigate to other crypto destinations online the web browser wallet can be used every day too,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,but it's obviously not as accessible as a pocket-sized mobile device the browser web wallet is especially useful for people who may want to have advanced charting software pulled up while they're managing their crypto wallet but don't want to have to toggle between their phone and their computer some examples of web browser wallets are metamask phantom myetherwallet math wallet and coinbase wallet as in the web browser extension which then brings us to the ugly duckling of the hot wallet family desktop web app wallets they're not very popular at all we will move fast through this option because it's hard to justify using a web app when you can just as easily run a browser and access and manage your crypto from there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,but if you are so inclined you can check out trustwallet web app for desktops well that wraps up hot wallets but now it's time to dive into the world of cold wallets first you might be wondering what makes a wallet cold if i live in florida can i still use a cold wallet or will it melt first off you absolutely can live in florida and use a cold wallet florida is where i spend most of the year so i would know all jokes aside the cold wall is pretty simple technology that is considered to be the safest way to store private keys to your crypto holdings now remember in the intro when i said we would cover some more advanced concepts we'll strap in folks because it's about to get advanced cold wallets are valuable because they remove the possibility of someone hacking into your computer or mobile device to take your private key your private key is what you own when you own crypto it may be disappointing to hear that you don't store coins in any kind of wallet you only store the private key that key is then used to plug you back into the blockchain of your crypto you own the blockchain recognizes your private key as legitimate and then knows that it can proceed with any withdrawals you may want to make you should not be disappointed in this fact the cold wall is the physical cherry on top of the closest thing humanity has come to a perfectly secure store value,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,okay you made it to their side of the advanced material that wasn't so bad was it hopefully it was beautifully reassuring cold wallets are usually a mobile app paired with a physical digital type of device containing your private key that can be removed from a computer and thus taken offline into the world of ice cold security examples of cold wallet options are trezor ledger cool wallet pro and keepkey these options are honestly pretty cool but you have to remember that the files that get transferred to the cold storage drive need to then be deleted from your computer or your phone otherwise you just spent money on a fancy flash drive but your private key is still stored on a device connected to the internet vulnerable to hacks oh yeah these cold wallets are not free like your mobile device wallets the only ones i would trust should typically range between 75 dollars and 300 depending on how many bells and whistles you want,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,them to have now let's talk about some considerations you should have before you narrow down your search for the best crypto wallet if you have spent any time shopping around for apps and digital games then you should be familiar with the reality that not all apps being available on your favorite smart device for instance one of the more popular video games age of empires has the newest version that is not available on apple ios devices this holds true for crypto wallets as well most of the bigger wallet providers like coinbase and binance have made apps that are compatible with both ios and android operating systems but you absolutely want to check to make sure that the wallet you decide is best for you will be compatible with your devices before you fall in love with it another consideration you're going to want to have is if the wallet you like is even legal or enabled in the country you live in remember cryptocurrencies are a revolutionary technology and not all governments around the world think it's a good idea for their citizens to use certain wallets or even crypto in general thankfully there are many good wallet options for the us and canada,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,but you will also want to check your state or province's laws in most cases you will not even be allowed to transfer funds from your bank account to the wallet this goes for crypto exchange apps as well if you don't remember those are the apps or websites you buy coins before you transfer them to your wallet they are not the same there are ways around this issue through the use of a vpn,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,but you use that technology at your own risk and i certainly don't endorse breaking any laws in the pursuit of financial sovereignty now the last consideration i will include here is the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets i touched a little bit on this without even using these terms when i went over the differences between exchanges and wallets essentially non-custodial wallets are more favorable to you because the wallet provider is not a custodian or owner of your private key however most crypto wallets are custodial which means that your private key is held in a trust or owned by the company providing you with the wallet now before you get freaked out know that the vast majority of crypto owners use custodial wallets and exchanges every day to buy and sell and hold their coins also know that when you use most banks they have a similar agreement with you in the small print that gives them a custodial right to your money i'm personally not afraid of custodial agreements but it's good to know about them and know what they are okay now i'm going to go over the apps i use,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,but before i do i want to go over the paypals and robin hoods of the crypto wallet space because large fintech platforms like these gained such a large market share of online transactions they went ahead and added crypto trading as a feature to their services this does not mean that it's necessarily a bad place to hold crypto but you should know that you don't really own any of that crypto at all but you can still profit from the gains in the same way you would by actually owning the private key that unlocks your crypto with these types of fintech services you can't send your coins to another wallet or stake your coins which is greatly the limit to your coin utility you have so now for the apps that i use well there are so many great options out there i have kept it pretty simple for the most part i do most of my buying on coinbase and coinbase pro i've dabbled a little bit with binance and by bit but as a whole i stick to what i know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
kjwGCajj7ZY,and that is coinbase more recently though after seeing what has happened both in canada and in russia where centralized systems look to limit the power the individual might have over their crypto i have recently purchased a ledger cold wallet well i'm not that terrified that the government will actually come after me personally it's good to know that i have a place where i cannot have my crypto be touched by anyone but myself if you would like a cold wallet like ledger we actually have a link down in the description below it's one of the affiliates of our channel and would not only benefit you but also benefit us as we seek to continue to spread financial sovereignty to everyone on this planet that's all i have for you guys in this video i hope it was helpful enjoyable entertaining,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

RP0Do5pX5gw,i want to tell you about a man named victor frankel victor frankel was an austrian jew who was captured by the german nazi party in 1942 and taken to a german death camp where he would lose his friends family and immediate relatives why am i telling you about victor frankel viktor frankl survived world war ii and he ended up becoming a world renowned neurologist partially due in part to what he learned in the camps viktor frankl learned while he was in the camps that he actually had far more freedom than the guards that were holding him captive what let me explain you see viktor frankl while he was under the boot of the german might in the mid-1940s realized what makes us human he finally realized the very essence of what makes us human in the first place and he realized that it's this the one thing the animals don't have is that the animals don't have the ability to control their response to stimulus what does that mean let me explain whenever something happens to you for example it's raining outside for example being brought to an internment camp for example being hit by someone and then them running off and leaving you in the dust you can't control the stimulus that comes into your life you can't control what happens to you but what you can control is your response we are able to take control of our response we are responsible we have responsibility we have the ability to respond and we can choose how we respond that's what he realized and what he ended up doing with that knowledge is he found out that the stimulus coming into his mind into his brain that of being in an internment camp did not have to determine what his response was going to be instead he had the ability the uniquely human ability to choose in between stimulus and response how he was going to handle the situation and so in a long stint in solitary confinement victor frankel came to realize that he actually had more freedom than the guards because the guards had been living under the false assumption that they were stuck to do whatever their captors the german nazi party told them that they had to do after the war viktor frankl went on again like i said to be a world-renowned austrian neurologist and you might be wondering jeb why in the world are you telling me about this random neurologist let me explain if you're in cryptocurrency you probably have felt very very strong emotions for example bitcoin and ethereum especially are doing very well this weekend my ethereum portfolio is higher now than it ever has been and my bitcoin portfolio is creeping back up there as bitcoin continues to rally and that can bring about a very visceral strong emotion in us i know you felt it and also on the flip side we can have a very strong and visceral emotion of fud whenever the market goes down here's the thing i want to teach you today this is going to be a pretty short video it's not that complicated whenever you have a stimulus whether that be bitcoin rallies or bitcoin declines you don't have to act on instinct your instinct when bitcoin goes down is to freak out your instinct when bitcoin goes up is to celebrate your instinct when bitcoin goes up might be to fomo into a trade that you didn't actually research and you weren't ready for you know this concept is well understood in gaming circles i'm a gamer by uh by childhood i've always played a lot of games for those of you guys who know it i played a lot of civilization stellaris i was just playing having a little bit of fun over the weekend kind of relaxing after a very long week we've worked like 80 hours this week it's a great great fun absolutely incredible best journey i've ever been on in my life another one minecraft great game but in league of legends there's a game called league of legends the pro community in league of legends they really understand this concept what they say is that if you go around blaming your teammates then number one you're being a bad teammate and you're probably not going to win by being a bad teammate but more importantly you're not going to be able to learn if it's always someone else's fault for example if i failed starting this youtube channel and i started blaming my dad or blaming my mom or blaming my parent my my school system or or blaming the government or blaming china or blaming barack obama or bill clinton or trump or someone or or blaming israel or blaming whoever if i if i start blaming people then what i do is i am giving them the authority over me i am taking that freedom that makes us uniquely human and i'm giving it to my captors if you will and that is what viktor frankl realized is that he actually has more freedom than many of the guards because he realized what made him uniquely human and therefore no matter what the stimulus coming into him was he was able to determine how he was going to respond because of that uniquely human attribute of freedom so you might be wondering jeb,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RP0Do5pX5gw,what are you saying that he had freedom he was in a he was in a tournament camp it was one of the it was probably one of the most horrible things that could have ever happened to a human being he didn't have liberty let me explain he didn't have options but he did have freedom freedom is your ability to choose that is your free will liberty are the things in front of you that you have to choose it is a society's job to give you liberty so that you have the option to choose but it is your job to exercise your free will and choose how you will make those opportunities work for you or against you you have the ability to choose oh i'm going to flood and i'm going to get freaked out i'm going to quit and i'm going to leave the cryptocurrency market and i'm just oh this isn't for me i'm not smart enough for this oh the whales did it oh the exchange did it oh xyz and the third did it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RP0Do5pX5gw,you see you can't control the stimulus but you can't control the response you can't control if you're on an exchange and a scam which stops you out of a trade but you can control what you're going to learn from that and what step-by-step process you're going to put into place in the future to make sure it doesn't happen again you can't control which way the market goes but you can control your education in it and that is why this is so important is because so many people enslave themselves to the world around them by not admitting when they made a mistake because to be philosophically consistent if you won't admit when you make a mistake then you can't admit when you have a success because if it wasn't your fault when you made a mistake then how was it your fault when you were successful if you're going to pick one you got to pick the other that's how it goes that's why when people criticize me for something that i'm actually doing wrong okay hands up guys one of our core values as a company is humility because the only way that you can exemplify another one of our core values being growth oriented and continually educating and improving upon ourselves is by being humble and admitting when we're wrong the only way that you will ever ever become profitable in cryptocurrency markets is by realizing that the way you grow is by first admitting that you need to grow and by taking that free will that makes you uniquely human and not handing it off and allowing yourself to be enslaved by someone else but instead using it as the tool that god gave you to make the most out of your life,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RP0Do5pX5gw,so that's why i brought up victor frankel that's why i'm telling you his story and i encourage you if you want to learn more about this subject go read the book seven habits of highly effective people by um i'm blanking on his name uh stephen covey that's his name go read that book it sold over 30 million copies over the last 30 years and for good reason it is one of the most read self-improvement books that was ever written and again it is writ it is so popular for a good reason so make sure you go read that chapter one be proactive you'll learn more about victor frankl that's where i'm getting the inspiration for this video guys that is going to wrap it up for today's video if you enjoyed this video hit the like button subscribe to the channel we're about to hit 100k subs we have some really cool stuff coming up especially coming up this week something amazing is going to be going on on tuesday's stream on may the 4th so make sure you're there for that you're not going to want to miss it if you have any questions as always feel free to leave them in the comment section down below that is going to do it for today's video but before i go i do just first want to thank each and every single last one of you for watching as always and i will see you guys in the next video peace,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6JHd9iCdJ2E,but let's go ahead and talk a little bit about a man named ray dalio ray dalio said at one point he might be missing something about bitcoin and this is very interesting because one of the things i like about dalio he's an author he's a billionaire investor and he has been a cryptocurrency skeptic one of the things i like about dalio and this is dalio and this is part of the reason he's successful is that he at least tries to maintain a humble and teachable spirit what does that mean a humility means realizing that you're not always right it means realizing that it's not all about me it's actually more about other people and yes sometimes you do need to take care of yourself that's not pride but it's understanding that the world doesn't revolve around you and it's understanding that you don't have all the answers a teachable spirit is through humility realizing that if i ever want to grow then i have to be willing to learn and if you're going to be willing to learn you got to be willing to either one be ignorant of what you're learning or two be wrong about what you think you know because anytime you learn something new it's one of those two things being crushed either your ignorance is being replaced by new knowledge or your uh your um arrogance and your incorrect beliefs are being replaced by new knowledge so it's it can be challenging for some people who struggle with pride to have the humility to accept it either one they're ignorant of something or two they're just flat out wrong,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6JHd9iCdJ2E,so i respect ray dalio's humility in being able to admit hey i think i'm wrong about bitcoin so he seems to have a humble and teachable spirit and that is absolutely necessary for growth absolutely critical for growth and that is the reason in my opinion that bridgewater has now started in a small way to invest the company's assets under management into cryptocurrency so what we're going to read here is this bridgewater associates the largest hedge fund globally plans to invest in the buzzing cryptocurrency sector reports state that the hedge fund is not planning a direct investment into cryptocurrencies but they would likely be investing into other you know projects companies etc that work in cryptocurrency,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6JHd9iCdJ2E,so kelly i know you've looked at this a little bit what is your stance if you have one on ray dalio the man bridgewater of the company and the idea that one of the largest hedge funds in the hedge funds in the world with 150 billion dollars in assets under management could be stepping into the cryptocurrency space well the the fact of the matter is you have essentially like it's like running a race you have certain people that set the pace and within financial markets uh traditional markets any sort of market uh that has assets in it uh you have these whether it's peter thiel ray dalio elon musk jeff bezos uh warren buffett all these different people bill miller all these different people are trusted uh or admired sort of investors within the space and anything they do it's a it's almost like a trickle-down effect of not the dollars i don't mean the trickle-down economy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6JHd9iCdJ2E,but it's a trickle-down effect of what people uh gain confidence to look into so especially an emerging asset class like crypto which i can't i can't necessarily fully qualify it still as an emerging asset class i feel like it has emerged and people are starting to see the light that is on it right but when you have bill miller uh peter thiel ray dalio the litany of people just continues to grow it's giving a lot of confidence broadly across the global landscape uh to to to to more boldly move into crypto on individual retail and uh you know uh smaller institutions that are under their under their under their level and so ray dalio you know maybe they're not direct investing directly in to bitcoin or crypto yet but they're investing in a crypto uh crypto funds same thing as uh uh warren buffett adamantly against bitcoin for the last i mean basically since bitcoin came around always negatively comments every time he's asked for a comment on it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6JHd9iCdJ2E,but he recently invested in a crypto facing bank and the last time he has asked for comment he said no comment so that's already a shift in character across the board for a number of people that are setting the pace globally on investments in crypto so i think this is massively bullish i think it absolutely is and i think it represents a shift in this mindset of as you said the admired thought leaders in the stock world and in the traditional finance world and do not underestimate how important that is because you have millions of people listening to these people ray dalio is an acclaimed investor and author you know he is the guy that gives investment advice to billionaires so if he by the way i forgot to mention this earlier has confirmed that he personally owns bitcoin as an investment that's a big deal for the thought leading because make no mistake the right mind the right thoughts the right ideas can topple empires the point i'm making is that one idea good or bad can completely change the course of human history,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6JHd9iCdJ2E,so if you have the right people with a powerful enough idea such as bitcoin that can make a huge huge impact on markets whoa there partner you watched the whole video good on you now what you can do to make me even happier is go ahead and hit that like button hit that subscribe button ping that notification bell and let me know what you think in the comments down below thank you for watching,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,hey guys what's going on jed here and in today's video we're going to be doing a little bit more shorter-term technical analysis on Bitcoin and a crypto currency markets guys and in today's video I also want to show you guys how you can properly and effectively trade these markets that are fluctuating so much they keep changing direction and we're not exactly sure which direction bitcoin is going to go in or at least we can't say which direction we think bitcoin is going to go in with a whole lot of confidence so in today's video I'm going to be giving you guys some basic tips on how to actually trade these markets effectively safely and profitably so guys we're going to be going ahead and getting right on into the video if you do enjoy today's video what I want you to do is go ahead and smash that like button guys like I said a couple videos ago that like button was being done to kind to me and we need to teach it a lesson also make sure if you're new here hit that subscribe button and a notification about like cracked stupid jokes and make cryptocurrency technical analysis videos every single day here on the YouTube channel so without much further ado guys let's go ahead and get right on into it the first thing I want to do here is go ahead and recap what has happened here to Bitcoin over the last week or so and kind of use that to build into our technical analysis and then also use this market that we're looking at right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,and I'm gonna show you guys some example trades how you could have made those trades what technical indicators were telling you to make those trades why those trades were almost certain to be bullish trades all of that and more guys we got a lot to get into in todays video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,so let's go ahead and dive right on into it the first thing I want to talk about is this crash on Bitcoin here Bitcoin had been rallying for about four months and finally we've reached all the way up to about thirteen thousand nine hundred dollars and had a massive sell-off we actually happen to be live-streaming during it this sell-off Bitcoin crashed two thousand dollars in three minutes it was ridiculous and when you see something like that happen that is obviously going to be a longer-term sign of bearishness clearly the Bears are in control now a lot of that had to do with the thin order books and Bitcoin did just kind of fall through the floor but part of the reason the order books were so thin and there weren't as many buy orders on exchange with because people realize that bitcoin was getting into overbought territory that's something that we talked about in the Bitcoin Academy is the gut feeling of kind of getting an idea of where what the market is doing why it's doing it and having that feeling inside of you without having to rely on technical indicators the entire point of technical indicators in fact has a little bit of a tangent is to give you guys kind of an aura and a feeling about what the market is going to do you're not necessarily just supposed to trade off of one technical indicator you're supposed to trade off of what multiple of them say and what the bigger picture each of these technical indicators is contributing to paint says they are telling you something about the market and your gut can tell you the exact same thing from your previous experience that's a very important part of trading like I said that's why we talk about that in the crypto currency technical analysis Academy anyway from there Bitcoin continued trending to the downside and this was very clearly a bearish trend one of the things you're gonna hear me say a couple times in this video is the trend is your friend right up until it ends guys the trend is your friend right until it ends it's very important that you remember that because normally the market when it's moving is not going to be in the mode in the in the business of trend reversal what is normally going to be doing is it's in the business of continuing the same trend that it's already in for example here guys bitcoin made it one high two highs three hides or five six before it finally made a higher high it was in the business of a downtrend right here it wasn't in the business of trend reversals we didn't see one two three four five six seven trend reversals we saw one two three four five six seven lower highs so typically trends are going to happen a trends are going to be followed a lot more than they're going to be broken and that's very important for trading because you can reasonably assume that at least more than half of the time if you make a trade based on which direction the trend is going you're probably going to end up being profitable in that trade and that's a very important assumption for your trading because a lot of your trading is going to be either at the reversal of a trend or in the midst of a trend and then you want to try and predict where that trend is going to end from there though guys bitcoin did fall down to here to a level of support that we talked about around eleven thousand five hundred dollars to eleven thousand seven hundred dollars it's a bit of a zone right in here but this is the line we're going to work with just know that there is a little bit of margin for error there bitcoin did fall down all the way to ten thousand two hundred dollars came back up got resistance and then made a higher low now this is interesting Bitcoin made a higher low here and we're gonna talk about some RSI divergence over here in a second but Bitcoin made a higher low here and that is one of the early warning signs that a trend is about to reverse notice that we have the same lows over here and we have lower highs we were obviously in a downtrend we were actually in fact in a descending triangle pattern which we did break a bearish out of but when we started seeing higher highs or excuse me higher lows guess what happened next we saw a higher high then we saw a higher high from that a higher low we saw but this may actually come up and create a higher high this very well may be the reversal of a trend right here but we want to wait and see on that and we're gonna get to that in a little bit anyway from there Bitcoin did continue at this upwards trend we did have a lower low right here which could be an early warning sign of a downtrend but a very well may not be we want to give that a little bit more time to develop anyway guys now we're kind of caught up on up to speed on what bitcoin has done here over the last few days or so now I'm gonna go in here and cherry-pick a couple of different trades that you could have made I was looking to make a couple of these trades a couple of them unnoticed in hindsight and the two that are the one in fact that I was going to make at the time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,I actually well actually there were two of them the two hours going to make I was very busy during the time I couldn't make them I'll go ahead and show you those two trades that I wish I had a mate first the first one has to do with this ascending a triangle pattern over here I remembered this triangle pattern because I was sitting down I just finished recording the video I was working with my editor and I was trying to get the video out for the day and I wanted to make the trade on here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,I had the exchange up and everything I was in the process of making the trade but my attention was needed by not only my editor it was also needed by two of my friends who were talking to me is needed by my real estate agent it was needed by someone else I forget who it was I was completely split all over the place that's one things you have to do when your trader is manage all that stuff and still be able to get your trades in on time and pay attention you have to set aside time for that unfortunately I wasn't able to at the time because I was busy with very important things but nevertheless I was looking for Bitcoin to break out of this I was talking about right when this was happening was right about here and I was looking for this breakout saying okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,"I'm pretty sure that bitcoins about to break to the upside you know we're in a bullish trend we have an ascending triangle pattern Bitcoin has still yet to have a bearish reversal if Bitcoin does break out and then break bearish I'll have like a point five percent stop loss there's nothing but profit here I was gonna come in here long with probably 5x leverage or more and ride this up up here somewhere and I was probably gonna ride that probably to around 13,500 hours or so before I actually topped out I didn't have a exact price target I was gonna kind of just go with the flow and see what happened",overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,but I want to put a buy order in here because this was a good place to buy let me explain exactly why I think this is a good place to buy and long the reason for that part of what part of it is what I just said Bitcoin was already in an uptrend this is an ascending triangle pattern one that's a consolidation pattern there normally trend continuing patterns if you see Bitcoin goes into a consolidation pattern normally the trend that entered of the pattern is going to be the same one that exist the pattern likewise it was also an ascending triangle panner which is typically a bullish pattern also we were getting very close to the end of this pattern so I was pretty sure that Bitcoin was about to finish the pattern and I also remember when I was watching this we start seeing some exuberance rally up to that level of resistance you can see these last two couple of candlesticks and moved much quicker,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,and then these other ones they're much more green because Bitcoin was moving much faster and we did see a volume spike down here everything was indicating that we were probably about to see a bullish breakout and guys,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,I'll be honest with you there's not as much evidence that this was going to be a breakout to the upside as there is with a couple of these other trades but the thing is you don't actually always need evidence of what the trend is going to do for your trade you have to manage your risk and reward if you're in the cryptocurrency technical analysis an imino undreds nearly a thousand of you guys are now I hear you talk about all the time when we do live streams the first video and the technical analysis portion of the cryptocurrency technical analysis Academy deals with risk and reward and what you need to do when you're trading and we talked about that in the very next video here excuse me the video after that is how to how to plan and execute profitable trades we talked about in that video that you want to mitigate your risk while maximizing your reward if there is a 5 to 1 chance that 5 times you're going to actually have a you're going to make money but one time you're going to lose money but the one time you lose money you're going to lose 10 times the money then if you had a 1 then you're actually at a negative risk to reward ratio because if you factor in how much money your stand to lose and gain it's not a good trade right here let me give you something concrete you kind of understand what I'm saying here if I risk 0.5% stop-loss but it looks like Bitcoin was breaking to the upside,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,so it was more likely that Bitcoin was going to continue moving to the upside and there was a massively higher margin of profit up here than just the point 5 percent down here let's say 5 percent and then not only do we have a 10x gain to loss ratio we also have a higher risk to reward ratio because it's more likely to Bitcoin straining to the upside that's kind of a hard thing to explain very quickly here that's why there's two entire videos on this concept and it's nearly 40 minutes long in the cryptocurrency technical analysis can Amin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,"but that's the brief synopsis is that you want to mitigate your risk while maximizing your reward mitigate your lost potential while gaining your margin for profit if you do that then you can make a trade without any technical indicators backing you up and statistically more likely than not you're going to make money you just have to be able to properly signed values to those different statistics the ones of margin of profit margin of loss risk and reward you have to be able to actually read that and that is of course where gut feeling comes in another thing we talk about in ct2 a anyway moving on here let's talk about another trade I want to point out one that I would have made if I weren't in the middle of a live stream right over here with this trade right here let's go in a minute so we can really get a lot of detail and definition on this if you guys remember back to the live stream we had something like nearly a thousand of you guys watching when this happened it was crazy we saw that Bitcoin was trading up here and it was trading just under 14,000 dollars it moved into this pattern I had this drawn on stream this is still from the stream Bitcoin broke bearish out of it that was an early warning sign for me and right around that time I stopped being both any of the bullish as I had on Bitcoin was gone if you guys remember from the strain I was none too happy with Bitcoin at this point and I wasn't saying anything bullish on Bitcoin a lot of people were asking me Jim should I go into a long position bitcoins rallying I don't want to miss out on this and I didn't tell any of you guys are going by",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,"and I was warning you guys that tells probably not a good time to be totally honest because what I saw was this Bitcoin had a pattern right here that if it were still in a very bullish state it should have broken bullish out up instead it broke bearish came down here and tested support that we had previously gotten resistance on at $13,600 and then we came down here and we started training towards it if I weren't on stream I'm pretty sure I talked about this on strain I would have had a short position opened right here just below that maybe down here maybe a percentage point below just so I didn't catch a false breakout and I was going to have a high leverage short here because I was feeling that Bitcoin was massively massively overextended I was hinting at that and I did say that a couple times on stream but I didn't want to say it too much and then have it blow up in my face",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,but I was very bearish on this and anyone in that stream will tell you that and I would have had a short position in here and the reason that this would have been a good place for a short position was like I said you do it you're dealing with that risk to reward ratio and that profit loss or skew that that profit loss ratio actually something that you could call it you're I'm risking maybe 1% on a leveraged trade I'm missing on us on a short on a on a stock loss but I'm also standing to gain a whole lot more because I felt the Bitcoin was very overextended and it just so happened and this would have probably been one of the best trades I've done in quite some time if I hadn't been live-streaming but that's ok guys I want to bring you guys and updates on the market that's more important to me than my personal trays I'm doing fine I don't need that but I know a lot of you guys are still trying to get profitable anyway,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,let's go ahead and move on to a third trade that I didn't make I noticed this one in hindsight because I was actually sleeping when this happened I talked about this in the day before yesterday's video I think it was that would be this bottom right down here remember back to the beginning of the video when I was talking about how the trend is your friend right up until it ends guys and the reason I mentioned that was because one it's a valuable piece of advice for when you're looking in these markets but two it just so happens to have represented a perfect trade here in Bitcoin just a couple of days ago this was very very easy to predict very easy to call and unlike before where we didn't have as many technical indicators it was mostly based off of my gut feeling and it statistically likely is being statistically likely to be a profitable trade this trade would have been based heavily off of technical indicators and it would have been a very good trade to make the reason for this is because of RSI divergence we see if there was a low right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,and we see if there was a lower low right here well check out the RSI there's a low right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,and there's a higher low on the RSI if you were to take out a little trendline and draw that that looks something like that on the bottom of the chart and something like that on the bottom of the RSI if you guys have watched the RSI video in the cryptocurrency technical analysis can Amin the RSI divergence video as well then you will know that RSI divergence is one of the most powerful technical indicators to predict a reversal in a market not only is it a very powerful technical indicator for predicting a reversal in the market it is almost always right I am you don't see RSI divergence get ignored all that often let me give you another example of this there's actually another case of our side of urgence with highs right here and lower highs right over here this is our side of herbs this is classical our classical bearish RSI divergence there's one high higher high on the shark one high lower high on the chart I was talking about this on the 15-minute chart any hourly chart back during that live stream and talking about how that might be a sign of a bearish rally,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,and I actually forgotten about that that was actually part of my consideration for that so forgive me for not mentioning that earlier honestly guys this alone right here was enough to make a trade off of but also if you go out to some of these longer-term timeframes and you check out the RSI what you're gonna see is the Bitcoin did actually get overextended on the RSI for the first time in a very long time the last time we saw Bitcoin overextended on the hourly our I was way back here on the 18th of June we did get overextended on the RSI down here and typically when you're doing buy positions or you're selling or excuse me not you're selling your longing especially if you're longing with leverage you want to wait until you have a good deal you want to wait until the market is oversold and then that's probably a good place to be putting in your buy positions a lot of people are asking me Jeb should I be buying up here I was like no look at the RSI look at the hourly our side why would you want to buy up there that's a terrible place to buy you're getting a horrible deal it's more likely than not that you're going to lose money on a trade like that and by the way we're not only talking about RSI when it comes to this bottom right here if you look at the MACD out here on the hourly chart then you will see that MACD histogram actually started reversing direction and started converging bullish on itself right around the time that this RSI divergence was happening right here you can see that change right there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,"and then we saw the cross to confirm later on remember what I say about MACD you want to look at the histogram before the crosses you want to look at the change on the histogram and then the cross the histogram is honestly more important than the lines on the MACD the lines are just used to calculate the histogram use that histogram that's something people never talk about very important I do believe we talked about that in the MACD video over here with the RSI divergence and with the change on the MACD with us being oversold on our sign the hourly chart this was a very obvious place that Bitcoin was going to Bob now with that said had I been able to enter this trade because this trade completely developed and finished while I was asleep and I have been able to work with this trade I probably would have taken some profits here at 11,500 dollars that's not very far up that's not very far away it is something like maybe an 8% rally 10% rally that's not huge in Bitcoin that's relatively big especially if you're using a leverage you can make a lot out of that",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,"but it's not as big as if you had up for example waited out the duration of this but we didn't really know that Bitcoin was going to go up here but after Bitcoin bouncing had these reversal signals I just showed you it was pretty likely that we were going to come up here to the kind of the governing level of support and resistance that bitcoins been respecting for a while of $11,500 and remembered that we are not looking at the market as it is now when we're talking about this we're looking at the market as it is right here this is what we're looking at and a lot of people will say oh that's so easy to say in hindsight it's so easy to say that Bitcoin was going to do X and hindsight well guys if we go ahead and take away our hindsight we can still see this RSI divergence right here we can still see out on these longer-term i frames that bitcoin is having that MACD reversal that a direction change in the MACD let's go back here and show you that we go back here we're gonna say okay yeah",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,the MACD has reversed if we play this forward just a little bit then we'll see if the MACD reverse right there as we talked about the met the RSI was overextended everything I just said it was still visible there before you actually put the trade in and in about four hours or so you would have made a good amount of money so guys basically what I wanted to do in this video is give you a rundown of some different trades you can make what I look for in a trade how I confirm a trade how I make sure that my trades are going to be profitable or if they're not I'm it again my risk basically what I've done in this video is I've gone over a lot of the concepts in the cryptocurrency technical analysis Academy on the complete surface level I didn't get anywhere near as detailed with this stuff as I do in the Academy simply because I can't make an hour-and-a-half long video today it is Saturday after all guys I got to take a day off every once in a while but the point I do want to make in this video is that trades are not as common as you think they are but they're also more common as some people think they are the reason I'm saying that is because what a lot of people will do is they'll fire up bit max with their fire finance or whatever trade software they look at and they'll say okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,what am I gonna trade they don't say what can I trade they say what am I going to trade now what can I trade what am I going to trade notice these three trades were things that the market presented to me I didn't go binding trades these trades showed up in the market and I was reading the market I wasn't trying to fit the market to my need to trade I wasn't making trades over here in this trend even though there's a consolidation panel right here that you could have traded the breakout up I'm looking for when the market gives me very obvious trades that I stand to make a lot of money on and I stand to lose not very much money on,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,and I can be very confident in these are three trades over the course of the last three days you don't have to make a trade every single hour to be a day trader these are all day trader trades but day traders might go a couple days without making a trade simply because they don't see a position some traders will see 20 30 40 50 trades and not take any of them they might take one or two of them because they want to make sure the trades there taking they are confident on they can make a lot of money on they can stand to lose a very little amount of money on and when they have all three of those factors they can then use a lot of leverage and make a crap ton of money on those few trades that they do well also minimizing the amount of time that they have to spend behind the computer so they can spend more time with their families guys trading seems very complicated on the surface,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,but it's really not it's just something that you have to learn it takes a long time it's something that has taken me a very long time to learn it's not that it's hard it's that it's complicated but when you do actually understand the concepts that go into trading and technical analysis and investing it's not as complicated as it seems and guys that is why maybe cryptocurrency technical analysis Academy nearly a year ago,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,and I've had to almost a thousand of you guys go through the course is because I want you guys to be on the fast track to being profitable traders in the cryptocurrency market big things are happening with Bitcoin I think you guys realize that if you want to check out the cryptocurrency technical announce Academy the link is in the description if you want to learn how to do technical analysis I highly recommend taking some kind of course because it's so much information that yes you can go and you can go and learn all this stuff on YouTube and it sounds weird that the dudes trying to sell you a course is telling you that you can go and learn this stuff on online,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,but here's the thing you'd probably don't want to do that because it will take you close to a year and hundreds and hundreds of hours and if you're using real money when you're trading instead of paper trading then it's probably going to cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars instead guys you can check out the cryptocurrency technical announce the county may be caught up to speed within two weeks or so most people go through the course in about a week and they really start seeing results after the first couple of days when they start implementing the lessons that they learn in ct2 a check the link out in the description but anyway guys I do hope you did enjoy this video if you did tell me in the comment section down below if you would like me to do more videos like this where I point out previous trades and why you could have made profits on them I realize saying things in hindsight is easier and I also realize this isn't very helpful for you because you can't go back in time and trade a market that has already happened,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Lb-Ciq8QpFk,but I do hope you guys get some good value out of seeing how I trade what trades I look for what trays I do and sometimes setup unfortunately I didn't catch any of these but these are three trades that I would have made had I been in a position to actually make them sometimes you just don't catch them but the next one I'll try and get I'll talk about that in the future guys if you did enjoy the video make sure you smash that like button hit the subscribe button the notification bell guys if you were new here well that much further adieu guys that is going to wrap it up for today's video I do want to thank each and every single one of you for watching as always guys and I will see you guys in the next video peace,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM, boom shakalaka what is going on everyone randall here from crypto love today's video i want to talk about how to do crypto technical analysis for beginners using four simple patterns if you want to find out what they are stay tuned all right what's up everyone randall here we're going to go into technical analysis for beginners how to do it using four simple patterns now before we do make sure to like the video subscribe also click the notification bell it helps out so much thank you now in this chart here i've been using this chart for the past month or so to pretty very actually extremely accurately predict what's going to happen with bitcoin price and i've been doing it using just four indicators what are they well trend lines support and resistance moving averages and fibonacci retracements so how do we do this well basically these white lines are trend lines and i've been using them you need at least two points on a trend line to actually create a trend line but when you do that we have point here point here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,and we just extend it we have point here point here we just extend it and generally somehow magically things seem to continue to bounce off of there that ends up being the trend and this trend is actually called a bullish megaphone because it looks like a megaphone now another line that we've been using for this time would be support and resistance so we had previous resistance right around twenty thousand dollars this dotted line right here in the middle of the screen and as you can see when bitcoin came up there it was rejected it was rejected it was rejected it was rejected and then finally it broke through previous support and resistance oftentimes end up being support and resistance for the time being now furthermore what i used was a moving average this blue line this is the four hour ma50 and basically as you can see here on the way up it was support support support broke through on top again support support broke through support support support support so as you can see these moving averages can tend to be support and resistance and then once we finally reached an extension of previous all-time highs once we doubled it the price started coming back down now how did i know this trend line well basically there were two things one i use fibonacci extensions and two i look at big events big events are places where people put sell orders like round numbers like thirty thousand forty thousand thirty five thousand forty five thousand whatever they are and there tends to be a lot of money exchanging hands well bitcoin made it all the way up to forty thousand dollars but then couldn't break through and came back down,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,but if we use the fibonacci extension which is this rainbow colored lines right here we go from the previous all-time high 20 000 to the new all-time high of 40 000 guess what the price came pretty much all the way back down as predicted exactly in yesterday's video to 30 000 and then it came back up so now we're going to take a look at a few different things we're gonna take a look at bitcoin eth and then one of my favorite coins to trade and we're gonna just do some basic technical analysis together,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,so you can use this to help improve your trading now i will say on trading uh one thing is i'm not an expert and two thing is i don't trade regularly and three things is if you're looking at anything less than a four hour candle people say experienced traders say anything less than four hours is just noise so if you're looking at two hours or one hour candles yet you may find trends there but more likely it's just noise so keep it to four hours at the minimum but i prefer trading on the daily so the candles that i use here i actually use a different type of candle that many people use i use the heiken a chic handle which means the average candle uh and it's a little bit different from the candlestick so as you can see typical candlesticks you know there's there's green there's red ones and they don't really give much of a pattern but when you use hike in a sheet candles it really shows the trend very well you can clearly see a bullish pattern and a bearish player pattern and a bull and a bear and a bowl and a bear in a bowl,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,so it's a lot easier to see the actual trend that the market is moving in so let's take a look at bitcoin all right now what can we do to actually look at bitcoin well we can do a couple things so like i said before we can plot support and resistance so if we just say resistance right there and i'm just going to change this so you can actually see it because that would make it a bit easier for you guys well we had some resistance there and as you can see not only was a previous resistance there but it was also resistance here resistance here now if bitcoin ever does come back down again that line would likely be support but what are some other useful things i really like fibonacci extensions to see where potentially the price could come back and also where in the future it could go so one thing i was talking about and this is really interesting was that i took a look at the bottom of the market right around three thousand dollars all the way up to twenty thousand dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,and when we took a look at that the first fibonacci extension at 1.618 is actually right around 30 000 right where bitcoin bounced off of so that's pretty crazy but if we actually take this all the way up to where bitcoin is right now all right and we can see bitcoin price is resting right on top of 78.6 fib right now so for some reason these fibonacci trends tend to work in real life now as you can see here this is somewhat of a parabolic rise so i'm not going to use any lines on a regular chart but potentially on a logarithmic chart i could use some trend lines to try and figure out where the price is going so if i wanted to do that i would create a trend line and i would say hey from the bottom where's the next point right up there so i would take a look at this trend line right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,and i would say you know if bitcoin comes back this is probably the line that is coming off because this is basically the bullish cycle that we have going on here the bullish trend that we have going on here if it even comes down it would one bounce off of previous uh resistance here twenty thousand dollars but also at this line the further out we go towards the middle of 2021 the higher the price is going to get so that's bitcoin in a nutshell,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,right now we're just kind of watching how this pullback plays out now let's take a look at eath now when i look at eth or any other altcoin i like to look at the eth bitcoin comparative the reason why is there's no point in trading an altcoin if just holding bitcoin is going to do better for you so when looking at these i oftentimes like to look at the the bitcoin comparative now one thing we can do right here is we can start this trend line so from the top here all the way down we can see there was a trend where bitcoin since about february of 2018 was not trading any higher than this and let's stop making it like mustard diarrhea color and let's make it there we go white all right so as you can see when big when ethereum price started coming up it hit resistance it hit resistance,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,and then it finally broke through resistance and resistance previous resistance becomes support so now that is going to be support for ethereum before ethereum breaks off now we could potentially take a look with a fib retracement and see where are some lines of resistance for ethereum if we were to go all the way to the top there look at this not only was this a fib retracement,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,but it was also the top of the trend line now when eath breaks out above that because we know that there is a big price target coming for eth previous all-time highs of 1400 dollars when it hits there he could potentially take off but the first place has to break through is this satoshi's level or 0.04 bitcoin level so that would be a big area of resistance for ethereum now we're going to take a look at my favorite altcoin for trading dogecoin now why is this my favorite all coin because it's an oscillator i've made a whole video about oscillators and degenerators you can check out right up there but one of the best things about dogecoin is it very rhythmically goes up and down in bitcoin comparative and if you want to trade this successfully you buy when the price is low you sell when the price is high so how can we know where to buy and where to sell we could look at previous support and resistance so to do that i'm just going to make these uh we'll make these red to let us know when to sell okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,and then we'll make the green ones buy so i'm just going to look take a look at all the places of previous resistance all right and we have resistance here and we have resistance here and we have resistance here and this is just a really great thing because it shows you the closer the lines are together the more resistance there is at that price point the more money changing hands because there's multiple times where we have the price resistance being there all right and we just do this for a few of them so we can kind of know where we want to sell in terms of price now the other thing we can do is look at where to buy so on the bottom i'm going to change these to green and this will give us a good idea of when to buy so we just look at the bottoms here and this is where to buy dogecoin simple as that,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,huh and when the price comes down so look if you're looking right where we are right now we are pretty much in by territory for dogecoin which is pretty awesome even though we've had a little price run up recently dogecoin which you can see right behind my head is still in by territory it's still very likely to pop back up because it's an oscillator and then we can sell it there so guys that in a nutshell is a very simple way to trade to use a few indicators for technical analysis one last thing that i will show you is a moving average so to get a moving average you just hit fx and then you can type m a and moving average will come up i already have one here and one moving average that i like to use is the 37 day moving average now this is a weekly so let's change this to a daily and then we'll change the moving average to a 37.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,all right now why 37 well i was just playing around with a whole bunch of numbers and i found that the 37 kind of gave me a good idea when it was a good time to buy and when it was a good time to sell so anytime the price was above the 37 day moving average great time to sell anytime is below the 30 to 37 day moving average great time to buy so as you can see here when it's above the 37 day moving average this blue line it's in those red areas where we want to sell when it's below there it's in the green areas and again we see it here and we see it here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
lBNoQeTaGaM,and it just repeats itself over and over again so a 37 day moving average is a great way to know when to buy and when to sell most all coins especially oscillators so guys that's all for today's video i hope you did enjoy it if you did make sure to like subscribe click the notification bell guys if you want to join our private discord server you can check out the link down in the description i will catch you later have a good one,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
956VkPvtA7Q, boom shakalaka what is going on everybody randall here from crypto love and today we have a trading tip this is about support and resistance one of the most basic forms of technical analysis something that some people base their whole entire trading strategy on so we're going to go into support and resistance before we do just want to say thank you to everyone subscribing thank everyone and nuking the out of the like button guys if you want to win on your shirts make sure you comment on this video and every other video to enter for your chance to win and let's get into things now okay also read the disclaimer don't be a dummy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
956VkPvtA7Q,duh uh so taking a look at things support and resistance now to give you an idea what support and resistance are support is when there are buyers waiting to prevent the price from going any lower resistance is when there are sellers waiting to prevent the price from going any higher now you can go take a look at the order book and try and figure it out from that but a much more simple method for doing it is just drawing horizontal lines on a chart now generally daily charts work well sometimes if you're doing faster trades maybe you could try you know four hour charts hour charts like that or or if you want to get like kind of long-term trends find real areas of support and resistance you can do the weekly charts so that'll give you a better idea especially if it has a few market cycles in there now this is taking a look at eos and bitcoin comparative on bitfinex with the dollar candles all we've done is these white lines here using the horizontal line tool so you go on the left of trading view up here you click on this menu,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
956VkPvtA7Q,and then you scroll down and you select horizontal line then anywhere you click it'll just place a straight horizontal line very nice tool to use but what you're going to do is you're going to place these lines at areas where we see a change in direction and price so starting from the bot i mean we have a bottom of a price coming up here going up to a top of a price here so let's look at areas where there are changes in the price so we have the price going up here's one here didn't place one there but right here okay we have another change in price so i put a horizontal line here well if we take a look right there is resistance okay because the price is going up there's resistance which means that as it's getting there more people are selling at that price okay so the price turns around well here it acts as resistance but if we turn if we go further down this line look it becomes support okay the price is coming down there and then it stops and it starts to go back up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
956VkPvtA7Q,and then if we look here again it's resistance and here also is resistance okay often times support and resistance change back and forth so previous resistance becomes support and previous support becomes resistance now let's take a look at another one so we dip down and then go back up and we have some more resistance right here well it's resistance here but then right over here it ends up being support and then also right here it ends up being resistance again okay we continue going up and we hit a little bit of resistance right here which ends up being support resistance resistance so we go back and forth between support and resistance and then as we are coming down i think some areas where we didn't hit yet right here we have some support which was you know a little bit of support here as well and resistance there so we see resistance and support going back well how is this useful,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
956VkPvtA7Q,okay you can actually base your whole entire trading strategy off of just buying a round support and then selling around resistance now a smart man jake canfield um from another smart man i think it was ray dalio or somebody said always leave a little bit on the table so basically what that means is you would buy just above support okay you're not trying to get the absolute absolute bottom but you would get somewhere close to the bottom and then you would sell just before the resistance so you would leave a little bit on the table up there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
956VkPvtA7Q,but you get the spread between the support and the resistance and you can use that as a complete trading strategy so that you can make some money now it's very simple it really is that simple to take a look at support and resistance so you can go and do this on pretty much any chart and really after you do it on a whole bunch of charts you'll start to get the idea of what support and resistance are how you can use them best and then like i said some people use just support and resistance for their whole entire trading strategy like for instance for instance all right so if we were down here in june of 2018 okay we saw some support so the price was coming down we saw some support and then we see the price changing direction all right and going back up where would we expect to see other resistance well if we take a look previously we have a little bit here so there could be a line right there we'll just put a line there for the sake of things all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
956VkPvtA7Q,but also we have right here this is a big area now one of the things that's helpful to determine whether it's going to be strong supported resistance is the volume so taking a look down here we have pretty high volume right there as opposed to right here where there's not as high volume but you can see these two areas here we would likely in this box right here find some resistance so if you're trading what you could do all right you could set a buy order right around here at maybe 125 817 satoshi's and then you can set a sell order right around here just underneath what could be uh what could be support at 133 752 satoshi's you know that'll give you a 5 000 satoshi profit for i don't know what is that that's a 25th 125th four percent gains okay that would give you four percent gains not huge gains,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
956VkPvtA7Q,but that's a little one just to give you an idea of how this type of thing works so simple in a nutshell supply and demand uh support and resistance and that is one of the most simple technical analysis strategy but also one of the most powerful ones ones that people learn in the beginning but they use all the way through their trading now guys if you are new to trading if you do want to become a good trader i would highly recommend signal profits this is something that i've been using very profitably for the past two months this is um probably this i would say the best signals group for cryptocurrency out there period by the number one trader in the world on trading trading view jake canfield he's from i love crypto all right um basically you sign up for this thing you get daily trading signals every day you can go ahead and put those trading signals in there you put your buy orders you put your sell orders you put your stop losses,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
956VkPvtA7Q,and then you kind of set it and forget it most trades are trading between 10 and 80 percent profits every once in a while one hits the stop loss but in the past two months uh very few have hit their stop losses most of them have been getting a lot of big gains i think in the past month we've had about five to seven of them that have gone over 70 profit uh some of them approaching 100 profit so it is a very good thing i highly recommend it it's seven dollars for two week trial you can check it out there is a link down in the description other than that guys uh if you do want to get the crypto love daily newsletter go to crypto dashlaw.com enter your email there you will join the newsletter where you'll enter to win a ledger nano s you'll get the daily news and soon there will be an option for an investing newsletter so check that stuff out i'll catch you guys later hope you enjoyed the episode and peace,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

F_dPFJVSH2M,dollars now for Bitcoin it does appear like the Kumo Cloud just Twisted bullish From ichimoku's perspective Bitcoin likes to follow the same pattern over and over again you can see this in 2012 2015 and 2018 where there's a bullish TK cross which is marked by the one so you can see here then it enters the kumu cloud which you can see with the twos and the circles okay then the chiku crosses over the kijun which is the three you can see all of these and fourth the Kumo twists and flips bullish as you can see where it goes from the red to the green now all of these things have happened so far we've had one two three and four we are flipping bullish this is no exception to the rule this preceded all major Bitcoin rallies not only that but it turns out that spy or SPX every breakout in xpx brought about a major move in Bitcoin in the past we can see break out of the downtrend major Bull Run for Bitcoin Breakout downtrend major Bull Run for Bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
F_dPFJVSH2M,well we just had a break out of the downtrend potentially major Bull Run four Bitcoin not only that the six month charts and the 10 SMA which is this line right here when Bitcoin loses a significant moving average drops below it it gives a very bullish signal Bitcoin skyrockets every time when it recovers the SMA you can see when it broke down here and then recovered that was right before a large rally for Bitcoin again when it broke this line and recovered a large rally for Bitcoin well breaking this line right now when we do have recovery that could be very very good news for Bitcoin with the Chan momentum oscillator telling us where money is Flowing you can see it's lining with the same pattern Rising wedges that we've seen previously is passed through the zero line where these green circles are and it's been reaching the top the cons condition could ignite Bitcoin you can see that historically with these Rising wedges breaking through the zero line and then once that breaks out again large moves for Bitcoin how could this all be happening the price is collapsing remember a few months ago it was fifteen thousand dollars but every time you see a dip it's a great opportunity especially in a bull market with Bitcoin when it closes above the Keltner Channel which is this blue band in the middle the Bull Run has just started 2015 2019 2020,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
F_dPFJVSH2M,and it looks like we are closing above there right now just getting started as a matter of fact this pullback could be part of a total normal Elliott wave you can see Elliott wave mid-top moves one two three four five then we have a parabolic bull run one two three four five and then the bear Market one two three four five and the mid-top move starting from the bottom one two three four five could put us to the Forty to sixty thousand dollar area for Bitcoin and not only that,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
F_dPFJVSH2M,but now maybe the time to accumulate all coins it turns out a lot of all coins are heavily oversold on intermediate time frames correction could last a bit longer but heavy bounces are usually the case you can see all coins like Litecoin do not stay down in this oversold territory for very long before bouncing back for 72 percent gains 58 gains now might be the time to scoop it up before we see maybe an all season I don't know we'll kind of have to see how things play out but that's all for today's episode so thanks for watching if you enjoyed it push that like button I'll catch you guys later have a good one love you peace if you don't think bitcoin's going to a million dollars a coin and then 10 million dollars a coin you're already a loser from now on if you don't own Bitcoin you're a,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0rpMLAWe-OY, what is up guys Randall here from crypto love and today I have an episode for you about three things I wish I knew about Bitcoin before I got started or right when I got started or days or weeks or months after I got started these are three things I wish I knew in the beginning when I first started with a Bitcoin that I want to share with you because I think you'll find this helpful if you don't know this stuff already you may already know it I don't know you're all pretty darn smart but before we get started I just want to get to say guys thank you to everyone subscribing for daily videos about Bitcoin cryptocurrencies thank their own national on that like button and you guys if you want to find out how to want a free legend I know as a darling I'll ice cream which will happen tonight stay tuned [Music] now first thing I wish I knew about Bitcoin when I got into it is that today's price is probably the best you're ever going to see it okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,"it is highly unlikely that the price is coming down now it could all right those of us who have just got in a Bitcoin pretty recently has seen quite a downfall which you'll see above my head right there okay so it was at 20,000 now it's down to around 10,000 fluctuating around there and everybody's like oh should I buy and should I sell when's the time to get in well guys I want to show you something so I got into Bitcoin back when I was under $2,000 and when I first got it I was like oh this is kind of like the highest it's ever been should I wait should I not wait should I wait I'll put a little bit in maybe I won't put too much in I'll put a little bit in and I'll wait and I'll see and that was the best prices I've ever seen in my life okay now the price may come down there nobody knows with Bitcoin don't put any money and you're not willing to lose okay okay I'm not a financial adviser not financial advice obviously you know that stuff",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,but this giant run-up here that we're seeing there that this one here looked exactly the same this one there in September and then before that that one there May looked exactly the same so it's just the most recent run-up that's the one that looks the largest but probably the prices that you're seeing now are the best prices you may ever see in your entire life and just showing you historically since the beginning of time since the dinosaurs or since you know 2009 when Bitcoin came about the price of Bitcoin has generally gone up all right the price keeps going up up and up and up and up and up it's the tens of dollars and hundreds of dollars then the thousands of dollars then the tens of thousands of dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,okay the price just keeps going up and up and up and if you think about this in the sense of basic economics this makes sense all right basic economics our supply and demand so with Bitcoin we have a fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoin actually 17 million because 4 million are lost forever well with a fixed supply that means that when the domaine increases the price increases so the more adoption the more people believing in Bitcoin the more people wanting to buy an own and use Bitcoin the higher the price will go so given time the price is always going to go up so that being that the number one thing that I wish I knew when I first got into Bitcoin and crypto currencies is that the price is always going up almost always so you want to get yours now all right all right now taking a look at the second thing the second one that I wanted to know so this one comes from this article it was let's see I mean it was months and months from when I got into Bitcoin and crypto currencies until I saw this article which changed my life all right when I first got into Bitcoin II cryptos my strategy with crypto currencies is like I'll just own the top 20 Kryptos and hotle them and hope for the best all right now if we then I saw this article,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,okay and in this article there's this graph here all right now if you click on the graph below thing it'll bring you to this article which is 118 coins plotted over time why huddling all coin indexes does not work my home link all coins does not work and this is what it took me a while to learn is that the majority of crypto currencies all coins will not do better than just hot link Bitcoin now why own crypto currencies for the long term if you're better off just hollowing Bitcoin I don't know and this completely changed my strategy 100% in terms of what I do with Bitcoin with crypto currencies so I hobble Bitcoin and maybe one or two other alt coins that I really really like that I realize may not do as good as Bitcoin in the long term but I just want to hobble them long term,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,and then the rest of the crypto currencies I just trade those for games we're very small losses okay always set my stop losses but because of this I don't I don't huddle all coins especially not for the long term because they're not gonna do well so I'll show you I'll show you taking a look at this graph so I'll just explain this graph to you I use this all the time when I tell you guys about it but basically this this is Bitcoin and all coins in days since launched on a logarithmic scale and logarithmic scale is based on tens so we have one ten hundred thousand ten thousand it's not a linear scale okay it's like an exponential scale this red line here that's bitcoin always going up like I said basic economics supply and demand the rest are these altcoins all trending down I don't know if you guys see that they're all trending down now what does that mean what is it mean Randle I don't know well what it means is that by huddling all coins you're just gonna be losing okay by huddling Bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,you're gonna be winning but if you see there are spikes and values so you can trade all coins for gains and how you do that is you buy them you set a stop loss and then if the price goes up then you sell off parts of it from time to time okay so as the doubles you sell off so as it goes higher you sell off some there but if the price goes down you just get out with your stop losses and you cut your losses to a small portion and that's how you do it now a lot of people ask well what's this one here what's that one that must be aetherium right no it's not and it was I thought for a long time those big connect but it's not bad either it's game credits okay go figure game credits is the one that for some reason shot up way up there so that's that but if you take a look at the Bitcoin comparative it's come way down since then so whoo [Music] again all coins just don't do well versus Bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,and then if we take a look based on the years so like if you were handling all coins you know a couple years ago you'd be doing much better off than if you were huddling all coins today taking a look at this this is all coins by year ha telling them so 2010 really there was only Bitcoin so obviously going up 2012 we had light coin and not doing as well 2013 worse 2014 worse 2015 worse 2016 by far the worst year yet so yeah it just gets worse and worse don't huddle all coins that's the second thing that I wish I knew all right so guys yeah read that article take a look at that I mean it's science and technology we want to use that more than emotion I know everybody wants the altcoins wants to ice yours all that stuff because of emotion they want the big wins they want a gamble win big and while that's possible statistically you're going to lose all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,so that's number two number three number three is I wish I knew that you can dollar-cost average Bitcoin all right now I've been investing in stocks and mutual funds since I've been like 18 years old so I've been doing that for a long time long time long term investing and I've been doing dollar-cost averaging for a long time and what dollar cost averaging is is basically investing a fixed dollar amount into an investment every month or every year on a on a fixed time period and just doing that and the coolest thing about dollar cost averaging is like Ron Popeil and his daytime rotisserie oven or whatever is called you can just set it and forget it so the coolest thing is is you can just set this up you can forget it and then automatically you're making money now this is just dollar cost averaging versus lump sum averaging for a year okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,and if you take if you take a look in a year you end up doing better by dollar cost averaging that if you just plopped in a lump sum for the first few months you do better with the lump sum but that's just because you haven't invested as much and generally with dollar cost averaging you can usually put more money in than if you do a lump sum investment all right but that's just for a year now you got to imagine let's think about three years five years ten years in terms of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies this could be potentially huge all right now the other thing that I should mention is like when like making youtube videos about Bitcoin and crypto currencies every time every time we see the market way up here so at the peak there at the peak here at the peak there a lot of people contact me and say how do I buy Bitcoin now and I say don't buy Bitcoin now but but they don't want that answer they want to buy Bitcoin now they want to plop in a huge lump sum at the very top,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,and I tell them don't do that just dollar false average and they said I don't want a dollar across average I want to buy it now because I don't know if the price is gonna go up and I tell them is that all-time highs the price is coming down but here's the thing dollar cost averaging the best way to get into any type of market when you don't know what it's doing and with Bitcoin cryptocurrencies we really don't know but if you believe in the technology if you believe in Bitcoin and crypto currencies dollar cost averaging is the best way to get in so I wish that I knew this when I first started because then I could have it took a good three months or so until I really realized that I could do the dollar cost averaging with Bitcoin and you can set it up you can forget about it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,and then it just runs on autopilot you don't have to think about it I made a whole video on it so if you go to youtube search dollar cost averaging Bitcoin crypto love you can find my video there I walk you through how to do it on coin base it takes like five ten minutes to set up and then you never have to think about it again,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0rpMLAWe-OY,and you're making the most money you can buying Bitcoin at the cheapest prices you possibly can so that's the best way to do that so those are the three things that I wish I knew number one number one would be the price of Bitcoin is probably the best it's going to ever be number two you're probably just better off hobbling Bitcoin than huddling altcoins n number three you can dollar-cost average Bitcoin those are the three things that I wish I knew when I got started I hope that for those of you who are getting into it now who got into it a few months ago those things will help you as well and then lastly guys I just want to say thank you so much for watching the episodes thanks for hanging around guys if you want to win the free legend @os go to crypto - lava com ledger you can enter to win we're at our late-night livestream tonight Tuesday night 10:30 p.m.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

oH8vmDnxIK0, yo what is up crypto love world everybody alright Joe it's been an exciting couple days in the crypto world and I put together a video for you so that you can figure out how to win in these volatile crypto markets alright to begin with if you look over here 199 subscribers 1 away from 200 we're getting there first person to click Subscribe wins alright and videos are getting looked at this is fun making more videos alright now to begin with if we look at the marketplace if you take a look at these 7-day graphs you can see the past couple days everything was falling the sky was falling everybody was freaking out ok today we're having a mildly green day some like Monaro 10% gains neo 17% gains but you can see the stuff is all over the place Clippers go up they go down they go left they go right thing or sideways so how do you win in these volatile markets good question let's find out rule number one dollar cost averaging now I mentioned this the other day in one of my videos and this is really important all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oH8vmDnxIK0,so there's this graph here I got it from the Bitcoin pub and basically what dollar cost averaging is it is every week every two weeks every month or every day if you have the funds you're going to put in a fixed amount of money into your investments and by the way I'm not a financial advisor do your own research go get a financial advisor this is just you know entertaining advice so every on a regular basis you're going to put in a fixed dollar amount like for instance when I first started investing years ago I put in $50 I think it was every two weeks or every month now I do a bit more,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oH8vmDnxIK0,but you know it's exciting if and so every week actually twice a week for me I put money into kryptos and now you could just choose any day willy nilly and that'll still benefit you because some days the prices are up some days the prices are down and when the prices are high you buy less of those Kryptos when the prices are low you buy more of them so for instance twice a week I have a recurring order to purchase Bitcoin all right and for me that occurs on Wednesday and Friday because of this graph here so if you take a look at this graph here it shows that on Wednesday the light green and Friday the light blue Bitcoin is lowest in price so that means that when I'm buying Bitcoin there's the greatest chance that it's going to be cheap which means I can buy more of it all right if I was to choose a day like Thursday or Tuesday you can see those kind of tend to be high,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
oH8vmDnxIK0,so if I was to purchase all in a Thursday or a Tuesday there's a greater chance that the cost of Bitcoin would be high so I'd be able to buy less now this is all just kind of statistics and all that nonsense but I think it works so I enjoyed doing dollar cost averaging so dollar cost averaging is going to be the first strategy that allows you to make the most of these volatile markets because the prices are always going up and down and up and down and we have news and things change and prices go all over people will have FOMO and buy high and then they have foot and sell when it's low and it's crazy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oH8vmDnxIK0,but if you stick with dollar cost averaging so investing is set up a fixed amount of money once every week once every month whatever works for you that way on one of these days which would be Wednesday or Friday that increases your likelihood of buying low and that brings us to the second the second strategy buy low sell high now I put sell high in parentheses because you'll see later I'm give it away early I'll do it every time all right so buy low and what do I mean you want to buy when there is blood in the water when people are freaking out when everybody's like oh my god crypto sir they're gonna disappear I'm gonna lose everything oh my got a sell sell sell sell now that's when you want to buy for instance yesterday okay if you looked yesterday everything was in the red okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oH8vmDnxIK0,it's blood everything was in the red people were like freaking out about these ICO regulations in China the cost of Bitcoin was dropping people were losing their head and because of that it made an awesome day to buy I mean I'll just tell you what I did yesterday just because I'm a savvy investor all right so I've had my eye on some coins but I like now they may be good then maybe they may not be good but I've been I've been keeping an eye on them you know just in case people start going crazy selling whatever and so yesterday when people were freaking out all right I went and I bought myself some discounted neo and also some discounted Civic wherever that is this way down here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oH8vmDnxIK0,all right so yesterday I bought Civic at 30 cents already up to 40 cents I've already made 25% on that and yesterday I bought me some neo at $19 and is already up to almost 23 says for that's almost a 20 percent increase from purchase yesterday all right now why did I buy these well number one I believe in both of those kryptos all right even though neo is facing some growing pains right now with China ICO regulations the I SEOs are only really one part of the platform I mean neo is the etherium of China and the the only reason that China really made those ICO regulations is just because you know look at all these these BS icos that they have out nowadays everybody's creating an ICO and they're just trying to swindle you the investor the person with money so China put a stop to that and so temporarily the price of a neo went down but that's awesome because I want as much in the OU as I can have because as soon as it becomes big when neo is trading at what aetherium is trading at or higher $300 plus per neo plus the gas I'm gonna be happy but if it doesn't happen you know I lose my skin it's cool,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oH8vmDnxIK0,but anyways this buy low sell high let's take a look this is just Bitcoin over the past year now if you take a look at these charts history repeats itself I mean there was a world war 1 and then a world war 2 and then before long there's gonna be a world war 3 and then we'll be you know cavemen but if you look at Bitcoin there are a few tips here all right we have May 27th dip July 16th dip August 22nd dip yesterday dip these are all awesome times to buy and like that is what I look for like I wait for those when when there's no blood in the water I just do my sip my regular dollar cost averaging I just buy crypto that I enjoy but when there's blood on those waters on those days those are the days pounce and because of that I'm a little bi a lot more to solidify my position on coins that I like and really just make mad money you know so this is getting to be longer than I thought but we'll just keep going all right number three don't sell,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oH8vmDnxIK0,"okay all you people freaking out don't sell don't I mean why don't put money into crypto that you're not afraid to lose and then just leave it there because let me tell you something if you just do estimated Bitcoin value in 2020 in this little thing called Google all right two thousand five hundred two hundred and fifty thousand dollars by 2020 all right that's two years away two and a half okay that's ridiculous now it may be wrong it's just a guess but if you put in four thousand five hundred dollars now it'll be worth two hundred fifty thousand dollars in two and a half years when else in your life have you had that opportunity for me never I've never had that opportunity so that's why I'm going all-in okay just all-in and secondly okay john mcafee the guy who invented McAfee Security he says he's even more he thinks that Bitcoin moves above 500,000 within three years all right and furthermore okay this is the exciting part this is why it's win win no matter what all right so this Magura dude says you want a bet and he says",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oH8vmDnxIK0,"yeah if not I will eat my dick on national television all right so that is reason enough to want it to be $500,000 I alone think that bitcoin would get pretty close to there just because of this quote and the next quote there the next tweet after that would be this dude saying I would love to see four hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine because that would be the funniest thing because then it would be there anyways but he'd have to eat his dick on national television so I hope you guys enjoyed that's my presentation for the three strategies to win consistently with these volatile markets to review number one dollar cost averaging okay check out the graphic Bitcoin pub number to buy low sell high but just buy low when there's blood in the water alright and number three don't sell because bitcoins either going to be five hundred thousand dollars in a few years or John McAfee is going to eat his own dick on national television all right so thanks for sticking along I loved having you guys we'll catch you later peace",overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w, boom shakalaka what's going on everybody randall here from crypto love another driving video for all of you guys who do enjoy the driving videos that i make this one today we are talking about the ultimate bitcoin and cryptocurrency investing slash trading strategy for 2021 to become uber rich to become a millionaire whatever your financial goal is so i'm going to go out there on a limb i'm going to guess that a lot of you guys see these coins going up like you see chain link pumping you see finance coin pumping you see all these other ones matic pumping you see decentraland pumping you see polka dot pumping you see cardano pumping and you're like oh i want that i wish i would have bought that oh i had that i traded it for something else oh why don't i have that oh i want it now and you go and buy it and then you're like i'm going to hold it until because the price is going up it's clearly going up i mean this is going to be the next bitcoin so i'm going to buy it now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w,and i'll hold it until the price goes up well there's two problems with your strategy all right so problem number one is that you're buying when you should be selling and then you're holding the damn thing for a loss all right problem number two is actually that you're looking at it in a dollar comparative or a euro comparative or something like that a fiat currency comparative and that's the wrong way to look at this guys you have to look at it in a bitcoin comparative why because bitcoin is the scarcest asset that's ever been created there's literally no asset better than bitcoin like in case you guys don't understand scarcity like for instance right now it's playstation fives are very scarce because of that they're selling at a premium you can basically if you can buy one you can sell it for double,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w,maybe even more than what it's worth however let's look at some things that aren't scarce how about like sugar okay sugar used to be very scarce not scarce anymore there's a ton of sugar and it's basically like a penny for a pound it's no value to it well fiat currencies mean the fed itself has said they have infinite money that means there's no scarcity in it whatsoever that means there's no value in it bitcoin however 21 million bitcoin 6 million have already been lost that means there's 15 million bitcoin there's over 30 million millionaires in the world so even if every millionaire wanted to own a bitcoin and look at how popular they're becoming with institutions every millionaire couldn't every millionaire could only own half of the bitcoin you know if every person on the earth if bitcoin the 21 million bitcoin were divided upon every person on earth everybody would only get point zero zero two bitcoin so scarcest asset asset ever that's why you need to take a look at all coins compared to bitcoin because here's the thing bitcoin is going up check the scoreboard it just goes up and up and up and the problem is the human brain can't understand the exponential function in case you guys haven't yet make sure to like subscribe also click the notification bell but the brain can't understand the exponential function warren buffett and einstein have both said that the best thing ever created is compound interest well basically the inverse of compound interest is the exponential function and bitcoin every time there's a halfing it follows along the exponential function that's why we have the stock to flow model that's why we have the bitcoin rainbow chart every halfing the value of bitcoin goes up a whole another order of magnitude it was ten thousand last time it's a hundred thousand this time it'll be a millionth time after that 10 million after that now this isn't completely because of scarcity it's also because they're printing a ton of money this past year the us printed more money than has been created in a quarter of the existence of the united states so they printed 25 of the money that's ever been created in one year and they have another plan to do another two trillion dollar stimulus package coming up soon so fiat money is has no value take a look at zimbabwe take a look at venezuela take a look at germany back whenever they had their huge inflationary thing fiat money goes to zero bitcoin does not go to zero now the errors that you're making in investing you have to make them i made them other people made them everybody who's ever made money in cryptocurrency has made these investments because they're a next shiny thing like you see dogecoin go up 85 x and you're like,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w,oh if i would have bought that a week ago i could be a millionaire today and it happens to everybody but here's the thing you have to learn from those you have to see those and you have to say okay there's a mistake basically with trading i mean trading isn't even a good strategy because every time you trade is a taxable event that means whatever you make thirty percent of it goes to the at least thirty percent goes to the government sometimes up to fifty percent goes to the government,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w,so you're splitting your losses with the government and they're taking no response excuse me you're splitting your gains with the government and they're taking no responsibility for your losses which is a pretty messed up strategy so number one that's why trading isn't great two when you're trading if you're buying on the ride up you need to sell within 24 hours because it's coming down within 48 hours and second if you're holding altcoins for a long time you better buy them at a big discount that allows you to actually get some gains so those those are the big two uh errors that are going on but there's another thing that's happening is that everybody wants to get rich quick all right you see that's one of the most common flaws with making money making money is a it takes time i mean with compound interest if you do the right things you're guaranteed to be rich but everybody wants to short circuit it everybody wants to get rich quick and there's a big problem with that you can't get rich quick you can get broke quick,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w,but you can't get rich quick every person you see who got rich quick they put in a lot of work before they got rich quick it took years and years before they got rich quick but everybody will tell you oh yeah just trade on margin do 5x 10x 100x whatever trade on margin you know why they're telling you that because every time you sign up on their link they make 620 dollars it doesn't matter if you lose all your money they're making money and that's why they that's why they promote those things i have never met a person who's made money trading on margin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w,all right i've met a lot of my a lot of people who've made millions of dollars from promoting affiliate links but i've never met a person who's made a lot of money on trading on margin it's basically gambling and gambling is a tax on people who can't do math however bitcoin is going up if you can buy bitcoin hold bitcoin be patient wait six years you're gonna be rich you know uh there's another thing that i think it's important to know so warren buffett independent of his uh beliefs about bitcoin and cryptocurrency he just doesn't understand it but he has done phenomenally well with money phenomenally well there's like not a better investor slash trader than him,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w,but he says that people want to trade too often he says if every trader were allowed to have five trades over the course of their life then you would have to think a lot more you would have to do a lot more research you would have to actually figure out what is a good buy before you actually put your money in and this is one of the biggest mistakes that people make in cryptocurrency is they buy this and then they trade this for that and then they trade that for that and they trade that for that and they're buying them during the peak of the hype cycle guess,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w,what when is the peak of the hype cycle that's the time to sell because the price is going to crash within a couple days it happens over and over and over again you don't want to buy when there's a lot of hype when people are talking about how big this is going to be how awesome it's going to be that's the worst time to buy that's the time to sell if you have it and if you don't guess what there's 8 000 other altcoins you could buy but the big thing is bitcoin is the one going up guaranteed bitcoins going up all coins i can't tell you which one's going to go up some may go up some may not what do i do every once in a while and really i buy maybe like one altcoin every few months once i know once i see one that's actually [Music] poised to really take off then i'll buy it the last one i bought was matic the one before that was celsius,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
jqQ9ErbsV7w,i don't buy very many but celsius got 100 x matic got 20x and the one that i just bought is litecoin because right now litecoin is poised to take off if you don't know why you can check out this video right up here so in s in a nutshell i just made this video for you guys because i know all of i i know the feeling i was where you are right now i wanted to get rich fast and my my greed to get rich fast actually made me lose a lot of money but i learned from that,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

LnGAWFtNr48, boom shotgun what is going on everybody randall here from crypto love in today's episode we are going to be talking about four strategies you could use to become a bitcoin and crypto currency millionaire and how do i know because i said so because i made the damn video and no i'm not the girl on the front of the video it's clickbait obviously and we're going to get into all of that stuff right after a message from our sponsor which is a wallet which holds all of your cryptocurrencies and you can earn up to eight percent interest on your cryptos while it holds them securely [Music] all right guys just want to say thanks to everyone liking the videos thanks to everyone subscribing and let's get into things we're going to be talking about four strategies to make you yes i'm talking to you a bitcoin and cryptocurrency millionaire we're going to talk about these from riskiest strategy which would be one that i definitely do not recommend uh two safest strategy and i use safest with quotations because no trading or investing is actually safe,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,okay what you do with your own money is your own issue and this is not financial advice all right so the first strategy is margin trading this has become immensely popular recently so for those of you who don't know about it what is margin trading well margin trading gives you the ability to enter into position larger than your account balance so that means that people only have a small amount of bitcoin can trade with a lot more now that sounds great because then like oh if you only have 0.1 bitcoin you can trade with the whole bitcoin then you can make like 10 bitcoin easy as pie right well here's the thing see with a little bit of cash you can enter into a much bigger trade and then with just a small price move in your favor you have the possibility of ending up with massively huge profits mad gains that's what we all want however for most new traders because they don't know what they're doing that's not what usually happens more likely price does not move with them but it moves against them,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,and then you get liquidated and in case you did not know or you needed a reminder of all liquidations you could just check out bitmex rect and you could see all these people getting wrecked on bitmex i mean you could scroll through here and this is just in the last three hours i mean people get liquidated on there all the time you lose all your money while trading on margin unless you really know what you're doing this is something for trading experts that's why this is the riskiest option now bitmex was a very popular option out there for a long time however the fees on bitmex make it kind of ridiculous and also the downtime makes it so you can't exit your trades so it's a very shitty platform there's a new one out there called buybit which has is becoming very popular if you want to try your hand at margin trading i would not recommend it but some people like to gamble you know and some people just want to learn if you do there is an affiliate link down description that helps out the channel,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,so you can check out buybit there now before you go ahead and do margin trade i just want to reiterate this thing this was something that was on reddit not too long ago this guy talking about how he lost everything he says he messed up he messed up really badly more so than he had in his whole entire life he saved up a whole shitload of bitcoin and eth okay and then started uh and then he discovered bitmex okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,so he saved up as much bitcoin and youth as he could he discovered bitmex and in the beginning it was pretty good because he deposited a small amount 0.01 bitcoin and he managed to flip that into point two bitcoin within a week he 20xed it within a week that sounds awesome okay trading with margin trading with leverage but then things took a turn and he lost everything he has no more funds left to deposit and he's lost all his crypto everything that he collected he lost and guess what he doesn't know what he's doing and actually he was somewhat suicidal i hope he didn't commit suicide because there were a lot of people to reach out to him here but yeah he he says if there's anything anyone can take away from this is not to mess around with margin trading and leverage unless you really know what you're doing it'll be the death of you literally so that's strategy number one i highly do not recommend it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,but if you want to definitely use the affiliate link down in description now the next method is called speculative investing and this is something that most of us do in cryptocurrencies i mean bitcoin and cryptocurrencies by themselves are speculative but you can do some speculative investing now how do you go ahead and do this well guess what there's over 2 000 cryptocurrencies out there and guess what the prices go up and down all the time well how do you figure out which ones are going up and down well you could join some of those like pump groups on 4chan and different stuff like that that they manipulate the market quite a bit or you go and teach yourself some technical analysis this is a really good book on technical analysis and as much as all the ta people on youtube want you to think that it is really hard technical analysis is not hard it's something you can teach yourself obviously there's a learning curve but if you start learning you can teach yourself how to do it and really you only need a few different indicators a few different things,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,and then you can be a really good technical analyst as a matter of fact there's a very good book that i highly recommend called an all coin traders handbook really goes into a few technical analysis indicators that you can use that are very helpful and also how to really speculatively invest for massive profits for mad games because that's what you need in order to be a millionaire right so you can check out those two resources and then you could go through here and you can figure out which cryptos to trade which to buy which to sell all right the uh the one thing that i did want to notice is as you are uh buying and selling cryptocurrencies it's important not to hold on to cryptocurrencies this graph,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,right here is from willy woo who's one of the best data scientists in terms of cryptocurrency out there but this graph is all of the uh cryptocurrencies in days since launch on a logarithmic scale now there's one of them this red one that's going up and up and up guess what that is bitcoin the rest of them as you can see are trending down that's not good that's why you don't want to hold on to cryptocurrencies for a long while you can hold on to them for you know days weeks months maybe even a year in your trade but then once you make your gains get out your initial at least get out the initial amount that you put in but get it put it into bitcoin because bitcoins going up now another thing you can do is figure out projects before other people have found them out as a matter of fact uh if you can get into it before other people then when other people get into it that's when you sell and that's when you make your profit okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
LnGAWFtNr48,that's how good traders do it and one of the more recent ways of doing that is this binance launch pad if you can get in on some of these uh cryptos that have been launched on there you can get some mad gains as a matter of fact eye-popping returns of 620 and 787 now this is not saying that's going to continue definitely not because now people know about it but it is certainly a possibility if you take a look here okay bittorrent uh it 8.8 x matic it's 7.2 x but the other one is 2x you know so not bad you could put in money make fast money sick mad gains real fast now on to the next one those were the two riskier things this is the safer version with quotations macd trading i talk about this one all the time but there's a reason why i talk about it all the time i've been doing it for a while i don't know probably somewhere between six months and a year and has been getting really good returns and it's very simple,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,and i only need to trade a few times a month it's something where i need to look at a chart once a day for a couple seconds to decide if i actually need to do anything that day and it's very very simple so basically what it is there's an indicator called the macd and i use these standard uh things on here 1226 closed nine basically what it is it's the moving average convergence divergence all right so there's the blue line which is the the macd line and then the orange line which is a signal line and simple as it is when the blue line is above the orange line you want to be in bitcoin when the blue lines below the orange line you want to be in a stable coin all right now why because it catches a lot of the large gains and losses so i started doing it somewhere around here so i guess this was a year or so ago but it was because i noticed whenever bitcoins going up guess what the blue line's above the orange line whenever it's going down the orange line is above the blue line,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
LnGAWFtNr48,and it's very simple because you get to make bitcoin and then when the price goes down you hold it in a stable coin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,and then you buy more bitcoin once the price starts going up again very simple strategy very effective strategy it's something that you know you're not going to absolutely catch the bottom and the top every time but this is the thing about a trading strategy you want a strategy that will make you win over the long term and you want to do it every time so every time it crosses no matter what i want to do i trade okay simple as that now if you want more information you can just type in crypto love macd i have a whole video about it here also this video here ultimate trading strategy or cryptocurrency trading investment strategy for 2019 uh there i've done actually some research on this and over two years you can 69x your money just using the macd strategy alone so that means in two years you can be a millionaire if you start with fifteen thousand dollars today or if you don't have that much maybe it'll take you three years or four years i mean whoopty do still almost guaranteed millionaire within a couple of years and the last one the last strategy which would be the safest strategy for all of you out there is dollar cost averaging now in case you don't know what dollar cost averaging is this is basically buying uh more bitcoin when it's cheaper and buying less when it's more expensive and how do you do that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,well you just buy a fixed amount of bitcoin on a regular basis so every week every two weeks every month whatever it is it doesn't matter but as long as you do it regularly you're able to buy at the bitcoin at the best prices because when it's more expensive you buy less when it's less expensive you buy more because you're buying a fixed dollar amount so the reason that this is going to work is need i remind you of where bitcoin is going okay here's a lot of price predictions we'll skip by the idiots who think it's not going to be worth anything but we have anything from 25 000 to a hundred thousand to even more okay a million dollars hundred thousand to a million dollars hundred and fifteen thousand dollars two hundred fifty thousand dollars per bitcoin three hundred and twenty thousand dollars per bitcoin seven hundred thousand dollars per bitcoin a million dollars per bitcoin that means i mean essentially you could have if you can dollar cost average your way to one bitcoin and mcafee's right guess what there's your million dollars that's how you become a millionaire,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
LnGAWFtNr48,but that's not all because when you dollar cost average you're getting the absolute best prices the other thing is i mean these some people think it's not going to be worth much maybe it's possible it's possible but we've never had a truly deflationary currency before i mean people compare bitcoin to digital gold but you know what there's more gold mined every year you know what happens with bitcoin it happens every four years okay and there's a happening coming up in about a year and when that happens the price goes up because of simple epi economics supply and demand now dollar cost averaging uh basically there's you just want to do it on a regular schedule the best days of the week to do it this is a guy who did a study of it best days friday is the best day second best day is wednesday does it actually matter could you do it on sunday or tuesday yeah absolutely as long as you just do it regularly the same day every week,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
LnGAWFtNr48,but i personally do it friday because i want to get the lowest bitcoin prices possible and so that in a nutshell is how you become a crypto millionaire you choose a strategy you stick with it until you're really good at it and then you stick with it longer and then you'll be a millionaire because guess what bitcoin price is probably going up i need not tell you that a million more times it may not i mean it may go to zero that's the possibility but it's a gamble you know it's a little bit we all are speculative investors but why not speculatively invest and make a million dollars while you're doing it so to reiterate the four strategies one the riskiest margin trading do not recommend it but if you do use the affiliate link description for buy bit two speculative investing definitely recommend that book the altcoin traders handbook by nick patel it's a great book to teach you how to do it third strategy macd trading okay if you want to learn more about it just type in crypto love macd,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
LnGAWFtNr48,and then if you wanted to find out how to the for strategy is dollar cost averaging and if you want to find out how to do that just type in dollar cost averaging bitcoin and right here yep that's me without a beard i made a video on dollar cost averaging bitcoin you could watch that video and find out exactly how to do it with a lot more information so that's it for today guys if you are interested in getting into more trading and you don't want to have to learn trading you could get trading signals directly to you where you could regularly get 18 or 11 returns in a day less than a day so if you want to check that out signal profits there's a two-week trial for seven bucks link is down in the description and then also hold all your cryptocurrencies there at least some of your cryptocurrencies in a very safe wallet and get up to eight percent returns on them pretty badass,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

QpIz1XsIXdA, hello everybody welcome back for another video hope everyone's doing well and that you're all having a great day so this is something I've seen floating around the internet the last few weeks and that is I think sure why this particular question has popped up so suddenly or why I've seen so many other videos on the internet giving incorrect or kind of bloated information but I thought I'd talk about it and I assure you this is not clickbait this will all make sense in a bit so first off as always I am NOT a wizard I do not have a crystal ball I am not a professional financial advisor the information I will give you will be factual based off of mathematics as math does not lie I am NOT trying to pump any coin nor am I being paid by any company organization or crypto group to talk about one coin in particular now that that's out of the way let's get to it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QpIz1XsIXdA,so how do you become a millionaire with cryptocurrencies as nearly all of you know by now if you had purchased just $100 worth of Bitcoin in 2010 you'd have over 100 million dollars if you had purchased just $10 worth you would have 10 million which means if you had purchased $1 worth of Bitcoin you'd have a million dollars worth of fiat currency right now got it so where does this leave us with every other coin I promise this all has a reason,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QpIz1XsIXdA,"and I will get to it so for example if you had purchased ripple XRP when the price was less than one cent the one of the last times has happened was the 18th of February 2017 which is less than one year ago $1000 would have netted you around 150,000 or so XRP which means less than one year later you would have turned $1,000 into around half a million dollars at the current market value meaning $2,000 invested just one year ago would have netted you 1 million dollars insane I know so by all estimates or at least by mine the typical number it seems to be around $1000 that you have to invest in order to get these kinds of returns the issue is in which coin do you put your money so even if we break it down realistically or more simply into small chunks of 100,000 small chunks of 100,000 because honestly 100,000 is still a very large sum of money but just how quickly it'll take to get there is actually an even easier question is split into three things buying coins that are cheap and undervalued obviously buying coins that will be pumped after their initial release typically ico coins or day trading and the last one would be the most interesting of all that I will go over so there's a reason why I tell everyone about specific coins on this channel like I said I'm not a wizard",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QpIz1XsIXdA,"but we all know it's more likely for according to go from $3 to $9 and it is for Bitcoin to go from 15 to $45,000 within the same 48 hour period this is why I've noted salt Eos enemies they go on the channel these will be major projects I told you guys about these coins when they were less than $10 each for a reason as all of these coins will have a very easy time going from 1 to 300 dollars a coin as the projects continue to grow and even funfair if you had gotten it when it was just that one cent that hitting $1 if you had put $1,000 into it would be giving you $100,000 made right there very easily so to put it simply without making this a 45 minute video I hate the term hado but in this market this is exactly what has to be done especially if you're holding a coin for a major project ëthere",overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
QpIz1XsIXdA,"'i'm just one year ago was $8 a coin $1000 in sweet theorem at that time would have netted you 125 eth1 25 aetherium which at the current value would be 110,000 dollars and if the projected price of aetherium hits three to five thousand dollars a coin after Caspar and Plasma have been released you'd be looking at three hundred and seventy five to six hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars of returns after eighteen months from an original $1000 in vested that's not quite 1 million but you guys get the picture the typical amount of time it seems to take in order to get to the million dollar return I know it sounds crazy in cryptocurrencies is around 12 to 24 months if you are into the correct project even if you're just in it to make 100,000 this is even easier because this could have all been achieved with aetherium Cardno ripple like coin lumens or even iota and a six to nine month period with $1000 haven't been thrown into them so you're left with a few options and it kind of comes down to either placing your money into larger coins which I would not say just at this point because the thousand dollars won't do much $1000 into Bitcoin or aetherium will not give you a six-figure return anytime soon or you find new smaller projects again this is why I talk about certain coins when they're new and the price is still low and before I forget what's really good is to look at a website called WWI CEO stats stas calm on the left side it'll show you a list of certain things click on the where it says ROI since ICO and prepare to be amazed it shows you exactly how much all these ICO coins have grown since their inception but the point is there isn't one way to become a millionaire or to make six figures in crypto the trick is as of now finding a lasting project and putting your money into it that's literally it if you have more than $1000 this will obviously accelerate the growth now this doesn't just mean to just dump your cash inches any coin pay close attention to coins that are worth less than 50 cents or even less than that with less than a billion coins in circulation they also have someone major backing their project big names behind projects tend to cause a dramatic rise in value especially if they're associated with etherium or have someone who has worked with Ripple with the etherium team or it was a former developer for Bitcoin this method has worked for just about every single coin in the top 20 if you do the math even better the last thing is if you want to be more active or speed up the process you can learn day trading which I know sounds daunting to a lot of people when I've told them before",overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
QpIz1XsIXdA,well it's kind of for those who aren't not even more adventurous it's pretty much for those who want to be more active the numbers will actually astonish you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QpIz1XsIXdA,"and I'm not joking first off as we all know at this point our markets fluctuate daily usually between three to four percent at any given time of day if you look at the charts if not more what most people and a lot of people who are day trading cryptocurrencies make the mistake of doing is they constantly try to get these humongous profits at one time typically nine percent or more during a trade what you should be focused on are just trades that make you one percent and value per trade why you might ask these are the easiest and are generally foolproof you don't have to worry about making nine to ten percent per trade because sometimes it doesn't work out a 1% profit on $1,000 is ten dollars so doing only two of these a day at 1% you'd be making more than twenty dollars after your initial first two trades without having to worry about making money on huge swings so here's the important part that is to say two trades a day only 1% per trade on the initial $1,000 will net you 1 point 4 million dollars after a one-year period that's not a joke or a fake number if you keep reinvesting the initial interest made and only made two trades a day at 1% a trade buying and selling is completing one trade obviously so if those numbers sound crazy to use a compound interest calculator $1,000 at 1% interest you may have to put it in for seven hundred and thirty years because traditional finance calculators do not support one percent a day growth meaning you would put in seven hundred and thirty and half is 365 obviously days in a year two trades a day would equal seven hundred and thirty buy and sell trades over the course of a one-year period for 1% would give you one point four to seven million dollars I know a lot of people who have done this and have made a lot of money by not worrying about the huge fluctuations back and forth there's a lot of money to be made in cryptocurrencies is pretty much as finding out how you want to do it there is not one specific coin that will make you extremely rich it is literally at this time it is multiple coins and when one person just tells you",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QpIz1XsIXdA,"yeah just buy this one coin they are probably lying there's literally about a hundred and fifty coins out right now that will make you very rich if you just pay attention to them focus on them do your own research as I always say and just invest properly once again this video is based off of research that I have done and the mathematics that I've gone over please don't just throw your money into any coins but make sure to just do your own research because your future self will thank you one day when you made $100,000 after having purchased some digital coins on line alright everyone that is definitely going to do it for this video as I really hope you guys got something from this cuz it's really really really simple I know it doesn't seem like it just do the math look at the charts it's all there what are there's so many people who have made millions of dollars they're not rotted they're literally not rocket scientists they're literally just putting money into the system and just waiting I hope you guys are having a great day wherever you are wherever you might be hope you guys are making tons and tons and tons of money",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

0hFYA43boIQ,okay that allows users to trade various cryptocurrencies primarily focusing on Shiba Inu ecosystem tokens they are Shiba leash and Bone wasn't there more coins there was a dig coin before they were there were five no there was also a stable coin as well the platform was initially launched in July 2021 and has since gained significant Traction in the defy space with its user-friendly interface and unique features like liquidity provision and staking Sheba swap quickly garnered a dedicated user base uh a I'm going to ask because I I know there are at least 20 of you out there who know this how decentralized is Sheba swap like do you know what the metrics are or what are you know are the metrics public that's also another one uh and what constitutes actual decentralization when it comes to a decentralized exchange I ask because about seven other decentralized exchanges oh from from now uh to about a good year ago were shut down people found their offices and told them hey turn it off and they turned it off and with decentralized things you shouldn't be able to do that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,and I'm asking because I'm sure that there are other people who are interested in using this actual protocol but they probably uh are maybe hesitant because they don't want their money taken and or it being shut down like the other uh decentralized exchanges what have you uh Ken Shai Toshi receive a letter from the SEC or the FED that tells them that he has to shut down these are the kind of things uh that I am just making sure to ask all those specific details about Shiba swap 2.0 have not yet been disclosed the community expects the upgrade to bring a range of enhancements and Innovations these could be it says it literally says these could improve security faster transaction speeds and expanded token support so the news is is that the Creator or the head of the project of Shiba Inu and and I think they're meant to be pseudonymous so we have a name,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,but we don't know a face we don't like we know nothing about this person uh Shai Toshi kusama uh has announced that Shiba Inu swap 2.0 decentralized exchange is coming soon but hasn't given a date I guess it's better than not talking at all what was that project there was a cryptocurrency years ago uh who never gave any news like they never told us anything that was going to happen until like the actual day of I think the coin ended up disappearing because they didn't understand how to like uh keep attention so people just kind of assumed that like the coin had disappeared and then four months later you would hear like we got an upgrade but there'd be like three people at the party because no one knew that the coin was even still doing anything so you know it's better to uh constantly let your uh crypto coin followers know that your project is still building and you know resilient in some sort of way as opposed to just not writing anything at all that's the shiba inu news we haven't had Shiba Inu news in a while we had Shiba Inu news every single day before uh it was always the same it was the coin burn it was more coins being burned it was another update upgrade that was happening potentially not happening uh got listed on another cryptocurrency exchange more coins got burned it was literally every single day so now we're getting look at them building out their ecosystem whenever this might end up actually taking place if it actually does take place news NASA Shiba Inu news,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,and yeah let's move on in I'm I don't understand how this was incredibly incredibly popular according to a recent statement Roblox that is r-o-b-l-o-x one of the most popular online gaming platforms has released a new category of wearable virtual items that may be sold in limited numbers by independent developers it is issued and traded like a normal nft and even has the same appearance I don't know that nfts had appearances Roblox players are free to choose their own prices for the limit heads I guess it's called a limited okay they purchase with a designer receiving 10 of the proceeds they free to choose their own prices 50 cents can I have this for a penny is there a limit moreover it sounds suspiciously suspiciously similar to how nfts operate these limited edition digital assets could transfer hands in the future while still providing financial support oh they're they're basically nfts they're probably just nfts just not on a blockchain,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,it's easy to Simply like create a computer program that says like hey you sold this someone else has hold of it if they sell it you get a portion of it that's just you know even if royalty enforcement has weakened over the last several months such is the promise of nfts Roblox limit heads yeah this is what seemsly uh what they're called are fundamentally different from nfts and not only because web3 isn't involved they also can't leave Roblox and this is a very big deal uh one will not find any roadblocks limiteds on the blockchain instead they are subject to the same rules okay as everything else in roblox's huge gaming ecosystem users may only use Roblox issued virtual assets when actively participating in a Roblox game um this was one of the most popular news stories that we've had in a while it was literally everywhere Roblox adds rare resellable digital items but they're not nfts I I it it's kind of like um I was going to say years ago,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,but this still happens now uh we sometimes will get news and it's like hey this company is issuing a digital asset or this company is making their stock digital in the digital Securities and then at the end of the article they're like but guess what it's not on a blockchain and it's like so what was the what was the point of the of the news then it's the same exact thing when you hear about that a country is creating their own um stable coin Central Bank digital currency it has nothing to do with us but that's always a hugely popular news in the cryptocurrency space that they're doing and or mimicking something similar to a cryptocurrency,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,so I think we had news last year that Roblox was actually trying to create nfts I think there was a huge amount of backlash as there normally is anytime the letters nft are in anything or anything crypto it was even worse years ago for those of you who weren't here it was absolutely egregious anytime you said the word Bitcoin or ethereum or a company announced that they were going to be uh supporting Bitcoin or using Bitcoin or adding ethereum as a payment method everyone kept on talking and it was nonsense everyone kept on talking about how much CO2 they produce and how much this they did and how bad they were for the uh for the world for the community for the air,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,and I was always like cars trucks airplanes cruise ships companies dumping in water you're not you you name it like why is no one paying attention to the other 99 of things that are terrible for the planet except for this one thing that has only been around for a couple of years so you know just uh what's the word um I don't know people are paying attention to the wrong things that's the Roblox has created something that sounds like an nft it's not an nft news I don't I don't know very very popular sure uh what is this what what are these I I think I'm just too old to understand anymore I don't know what's happening there's like a a Goku wearing a suit trying to come out of a portal there's a that that photo's too much for me okay let's move on also in the news Kathy Wood founder c-i-o-c-e-o ABC one two three at ARC Investment Management LLC also known as Arc or Arc and vest that's a long sentence predicts a seismic shift in the financial landscape as Bitcoin and ethereum emerge as the new save Havens Kathy Wood,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,you should I don't think I need to introduce this woman she is like the woman version of um what's this guy's name Jack Dorsey I mean you it's nearly impossible to find someone more bullish than her like Bitcoin could go down to four dollars and she's you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,she's still there she's talking about how it's going to take over the world we just need a couple more years before it actually uh gets back up there in price uh during episode 42 of Arc invests in the no podcast would discuss the evolving role of Bitcoin and ethereum in the Global Financial landscape she highlighted how cryptocurrencies previously considered volatile are now being viewed as safe havens disrupting traditional Financial systems this was one of the main uh of the word is not caveat this was one of the main criticisms I know it started with the c uh that people had years ago when it came to cryptocurrencies that Bitcoin could never be an actual everyday used currency because it's far too volatile and even more so that's also a lie these are the people who are just trying to get you to not use it all currencies start out incredibly volatile until you have enough people actually using them and they're in the hands of enough people who are moving them back and forth and this creates actual stability I know it sounds crazy as there are more people actually holding it and using it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,but if we ever get to a half a million dollar Bitcoin it means that there's such a large amount of people who are actually holding on to bitcoin and using it as an actual currency that the price will move by two three four percent at any given time but it will not be moving by 14 15 25 swings over the course of a day when you get to a multi-million dollar Bitcoin the price will move similar if you've never looked at and and I think it's nonsensical to even uh deem uh cryptocurrencies to be volatile when we're talking about countries that have like a 10 inflation over the course of a seven month period not even an entire year you will see that these currencies traded against each other are still relatively volatile comparative to each other but that's also because a huge amount of people are holding these coins I mean these dollars or whatever anyway the point is that's what the idea is as time goes on these will get more uh stable and secure in in volume,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,but I'm just going to throw this in here I think a large portion of what we're seeing when it comes to cryptocurrency volatility right now uh especially as they aren't as volatile as you might have remembered a number of years ago once again ethereum is not falling by 18 or Rising by 28 over the course of a day neither is Bitcoin many of the other stable coins or the other cryptocurrencies might be doing so simply because they don't have as much volume or liquidity as the top two coins uh But as time goes on this will once again flatten itself out and what we're currently seeing right now appears to be I don't want to use the word manipulation,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,but I think there's I think that and believe based on the news that we have been receiving for the last seven years that there are so many rich people who are in the market right now they basically uh know what kind of movements and are kind of controlling the movements because they basically own the majority of the coins because they've been the only buyers over the course of the last couple of years if you own it you kind of control it that kind of you know you I I think you get what I'm saying what was that chart that we saw the the Wyckoff chart if for those of you who haven't looked into that video I think it's called Wy is it c k o f f I think that's it uh no w-y-c-o-f-f,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,I don't remember you you'll find it uh where basically this guy figured out like two or three years ago that there's a chart that's used in traditional Finance to let uh smaller players know that the market is in the hands of uh billionaires and we saw that exact same like the exact same movements in the chart play out in bitcoin's price so it's kind of like a really weird calling card uh that the billionaires are here and that they're accumulating if you will Kathy would emphasized that the perception of Bitcoin and ethereum as flight to safety assets similar to Gold signifies broader adoption and acceptance than initially anticipated this development she suggested could be the tip of the iceberg for the transformative impact of cryptocurrencies on the world economy and there's her sitting on a chair right there in a conversation with Dr art Laffer okay who is her mentor and former Professor would explain that Bitcoin is currently fulfilling the role of a store of value I don't know if I would go that far,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,I I think we're there it could be there one day I don't know if we're quite there she stated that if confidence in traditional Global monetary systems were to decline people might increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin whether that's also that's not even a really a real question anymore that was kind of proven in 2020. um as we saw tons of people looking for other options and I mean it's very dystopian in manner as far as uh the world's economy was completely collapsing everyone was uh inside of their abodes um and therefore we're looking for other ways to Simply make money in cryptocurrency was like at the top of the list as something that was relatively volatile that had tons of people moving inside of its Market all times and where there was a a way for them to actually end up uh making money so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,yeah you know that's kind of basically been proven if we see if we see uh inflation continuing to rise Global Systems collapsing and things just not really working out that well for people around the world people will continue to move into Bitcoin and ether what have you uh over the course of the next couple of years if not into Infinity as the idea goes so the news is uh Kathy Wood once again is bullisher than she was before it's Kathy Wood Mike no I I won't even consider Mike novograts as being like a bull because sometimes you see him on CNBC kind of like flapping his wings and he's like he'll he'll mention like you know be afraid things might not be so good and then other weeks he's talking about how amazing it is uh Raul Powell is is a big bull what's the other guy the guy from um Michael Saylor Michael Saylor is uh uh I wonder how many Bitcoin Kathy Wood has comparative to Michael Saylor uh because yeah they keep buying up all the Bitcoin and there's not a lot left so that's the still bullish on bitcoin news,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0hFYA43boIQ,yeah let's move on rightio I do hope that you have all enjoyed I hope you all are having a great day great morning great afternoon great evening wherever you are wherever you might be I do hope it's absolutely fantastic um what have you all been up to what's new what's going on how's life what's the haps uh uh yeah and I will most certainly be talking to you all soon see you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
IwL85i9SURs, hello everybody welcome back for another video hope you're all doing well and now you're all having a great day so I'm not even actually we're too sure where to begin on this video this video is about Ponzi schemes in the crypto world and how they've gotten to the point where they almost proclaim that their schemes in order to draw people in so literally about a day or two ago after the bit connect the infamous give us your money and we'll give you back more money website closed down they announced that they were continuing on with their new project and its ICO bit connect X which tomorrow surprise of many they said that they were looking to raise millions of dollars and people were already willingly throwing their money at them for those who don't know I will not say names because I never do,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
IwL85i9SURs,"and I think it's not right to throw someone under the bus but other prominent youtubers one of them is it's a group of three who is now being sued as part of a multi-million dollar lawsuit in the United States days after big Kinect crumbled these three people deleted their videos of any mention of bit Kinect and guess what one of them has started to promote yet another coin which I've seen people on this comment section here on this channel people have been telling me to comment on it to make a video on it they've made so much money on it please talk about it etc etc please spread the word the coin is called divor coin da VOR co IM on coin market cap ronnie on the website it's da v for short and it is literally an exact copy of bit connect and that they are another lending platform and tell users of their websites and lock up their funds with them and in return after a period of time has passed you receive daily returns with them the best part about it is since bit connect has fallen apart and everyone knows about it the Dvorkin team has gone into overtime and they have started to proclaim that sits bit connect has fallen apart that they are now the head lending platform on the cryptocurrency world and because simply because they are untouched and other people didn't know about them before worst of all they are now looking for people to the fact that they even say this is not said there they say that they're looking for people in different countries and different cities whatever whatever the case may be to push the coin onto other people that they may know so that the ponzi can grow even further keeping in mind like I said other youtubers who were part of the big connect scheme are now proclaiming that this is now the new way to make money as bit connect was inferior in the same exact breadth another website by the name of crypto celebrities has emerged that allows people to for lack of a better way of saying it you can there are photos of celebrities and you can simply bet on a photo of a celebrity it works kind of like if you purchase the photo of a celebrity and someone else right after you purchases the same celebrity then you get your payout every purchase every celebrity actually increases the price of that celebrity and this increases until the last person buys in deposits their money and then has the chance of being left with nothing as the as you're left at the bottom of the period and the time has run out for that celebrity and people are now saying that in the most extreme cases of this you're able to lose up to around ten etherion which is around $11,000 right now",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
IwL85i9SURs,so this is just another example of why people why why are people doing these things if that wasn't enough can you take a wild guess as to what the latest coin out there is called it's literally called Ponzi coin um and again the coin itself actually says that it's a scam like a markets itself as a scam those people on the website that they will it says you will lose your money by using this coin the coin itself as a joke should not be taken seriously this coin is a scam lo and behold people have started to throw their money at this website the point of the website being that for every 100 coins that were purchased and put into a smart contract on the website the price of the contract would then double that as part of it all so much money has started to flow into the website that the Creator actually got terrified told people to halt purchases because people didn't realize that it was a joke or rather I guess he assumed that they didn't realize that it was a joke and that these people were trying to make quick cash he told people to stop but they can't because he's a run on smart contracts and you cannot stop them once they have gotten started at the moment poncey coin is still running and the developer has literally told people to please stop to cash out stop purchasing this no one has listened or rather very few people have listened and the website is still going and people are still putting money into this website I mean I get it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
IwL85i9SURs,I mean at the end of the day like I understand everyone wants their piece of the pie everybody wants to get rich quick like I always say please for the love of goodness do your own research if it sounds too good to be true and someone says hey give me a dollar and now give you back 50 what would you say to them in the real world you would not trust someone walking up to you in the street to give like I just don't understand what's like what's happening like what is really like what is happening in this world of ours you wouldn't trust somebody on the street with your money so why would you trust a website a faceless website and that tells you what's a scam I'm not understanding maybe you guys can clarify for me maybe I'm just not understanding something like I like I,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
IwL85i9SURs,I get everybody wants to make their money but come on guys I don't know what's going on anymore please be careful with your money folks there are a lot of scams out there and some of them are more obvious than others alrighty guys that is definitely going to do it for this video please for the love of goodness be careful with your money I hope you guys are enjoying a day wherever you are wherever you might be whatever you might be doing don't invest in any of these things tell your friends about these coins because I'm sure I know a person or two who has tried to get into this as well alrighty guys that is gonna do it for this video and yeah I'll talk to you soon see you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c, hey hello everybody welcome back for another video hope you're all doing well and that you're all having a great day as always likes comments and subscriptions are always appreciated as they do indeed help with the algorithm surprise i'm still not home i'm still traveling yeah i know i needed to get away but at least i got a video for you anyway let's let's jump right into it regulatory clarity may soon arrive for cryptocurrencies in india the second most populous country on the planet as the country plans to introduce a new law that will regard cryptocurrencies as commodities for taxation purposes according to local news outlet albuwaba that is a-l-b-a-w-a-b-a the south asian country's government has proposed draft legislation that tries to define cryptocurrencies as commodities rather than going the way of categorizing them by their technology the bill for simplicity seeks to classify them by their end use case payment investment or utility the bill therefore sets out to define the taxation parameters for the different classes of cryptocurrencies for regulators and appears to be in favor of cryptocurrency investors in the country who have been expecting such a move so this is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,and i mean it's been at least three and a half four years at this point this is one of the longest sagas in the cryptocurrency space besides the sec being special uh basically many years ago at the end of 2017 i'll even say the beginning of 2018. uh many countries kept on coming forward saying how much they despise cryptocurrencies the cryptocurrencies and blah blah blah whatever they were saying uh india however realized their position in the cryptocurrency market as they have a very large population and they were like no we want to keep the monopoly on our own money so they kept them mentioning how they were going to ban cryptocurrencies banned bitcoin ban payments ban blah blah blah blah blah happening over and over but they never banned it by the time we got to around 2019 the beginning of 2020 it became this really big kind of fiasco thing where they were like huh uh-huh are we going to ban it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,and i was like i if you are a country who is explicitly threatened by something you ban it there's we've all been around on this planet for a while we know how things work if things don't work for a government you're gone instantaneously like there's no real discussion so i assumed over the last couple of years that assumption i don't know a lot of governments around the world have seemingly been buying up cryptocurrencies maybe hoarding cryptocurrencies preparing for something in the future with cryptocurrencies wink wink and i think that this is basically what india has been trying to do them and their uh northern neighbor if you catch eastern neighbor western neighbor the other country that starts with a c that's next to them you know what i'm talking about who basically has been doing the exact same thing talking about banning it but also allowing people to legally mine in their country and talking about banning it but you know giving out so the point of the news is um at some point soon i'm gonna give it another 14 years uh we will know if crypto is legal within india,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,i think this is it's not that it's old news per se it's more like and no one really gives a gosh darn anymore because the rest of the world has moved on so whenever they do allow you know the law to go through the bill whatever they have to go through parliament uh i think it's going to be major because it then legally gives access to a billion people uh into the cryptocurrency market but at that i still feel like it should have happened a lot quicker but we know governments are going to government so cool,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,i hope this works out for them i hope the bill actually goes through uh [Music] i guess i want to say by next june which is really sad uh because i would love if a billion extra people were able to get into the market at these prices as opposed to any other future crazy price to me that we might have in the next nine or so months anyway that's the indian news let's move on uh uh over to their neighbors what the people's bank of china has allegedly completed its crackdown on digital currencies according to its latest report the central bank says it now regulates the sector routinely china central bank has completed its crackdown on digital currencies according to the latest report the pboc said it now regulates the sector routinely in its 2021 financial stability report the pboc said it has been cracking down on a number of sectors that had caused concern but it has now resolved most of the issues it was going after they said,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,and i do quote the battle to prevent and resolve major financial risks has achieved important phase results reads the report which was published in obviously in their language the report then went on to list the specific areas the central bank has been cracking on stating online asset management equity crowdfunding internet insurance virtual currency trading internet foreign exchange trading and fields that have basically completed the rectification work and have been transferred to normalize supervision,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,oh i got it the pboc has cracked down harder than ever before in his cryptocurrency industry in the last year this news alone should cause bitcoin to rise by a good 15 20 percent the pboc has been desperately trying to get bitcoin under control since a good 2015 2016-2017 pendulum swinging within that time frame because they've been doing this for a very long time the fact that they have now said that they're done with their crackdown means that we should never logically hear their name ever again within the cryptocurrency space what they mean by uh normalize the supervision is that they now have a view over everything that they wanted a view over and this is why we had news yesterday the day before uh that uh bit main the largest mining company to my knowledge in the cryptocurrency space has moved 56 000 machines to georgia and the south in the united states so yes this is actually very good news we've been waiting for these moments i i don't think it'll be met with much fanfare i don't think people will oh my,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,gosh i can't wait about this news but this is very important because they have been a constant sector of the industry that whenever we got news from them especially if it was anything slightly negative uh bitcoin would drop and the rest of the cryptocurrency market would drop if they have everything under control on their end and they got rid of a whole bunch of people who were mining bitcoin these people have now moved to other places around the planet uh that now accept mining you know things should be good anyway yeah very good news like i said i don't think people will be you know celebrating over this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,but we actually should because you know we don't have to talk about them anymore let's move on next up cardano founder charles hoskinson says that more nations are likely to adopt crypto after el salvador because the first country to recognize as they became the bitcoin is legal tender the chief executive of iohk the firm behind cardano says crypto has clearly won the market over he said over a hundred million people the majority of people under the age of 25 have a positive view of cryptocurrencies and a lot of them own them some that's the future their children will grow up with those values and benefits about the nature of money so in a certain respect we as an industry won um charles hoskinson usually says some pretty far out stuff uh but this makes total sense i um do not disagree with him it is a clear we have there there are at least 20 countries on the planet who are buying bitcoin investing in bitcoin mining bitcoin have allowed bitcoin mining have legalized it have let people do it you kind of get the the whole drift,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,i i think the thing that really always sticks out for me is who are they like i want to know exactly which countries because we have a good idea it's the countries who are under sanctions it's el salvador a couple of other south american countries but it's like who else is doing it because it loves stop it we we know can we we can mentally ascertain that there's at least five at least five other countries who i who are like you know what we have an extra 50 million let's throw it into the market and see what happens over the long term just in case this becomes something so that we can become richer uh but you know just a matter of who those countries are so yeah i think we are at the very beginning of like hyper adoption a lot of people still don't understand and it's it's understandable that people would really not get it exactly how far this is going to go uh or what it means to you know usurp the us dollar and all these other things but you will,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,i i give it about a good four or five years we're going to have a lot of people who uh didn't understand what where this space was going sold off a lot of their coins and kind of you know threw their hands up into the air but yeah this is the beginning of uh the the hyper bitcoinization as they call it and yeah let's move on also not sure why this even made it into the news i think this has happened i'm not in the future yet so i i can't really pay attention to it it says binance throws its weight behind cardano's alonso hard fork there was some news floating around like this it was like coinbase will support the hard fork finance will support the hard fork hard fork hard fork hard fork and there of course the major cryptocurrency exchanges are going to support the the third largest cryptocurrency is hard fork because that's what happens all the time so unless something has happened in the future where i am currently not um i assume this went well i'll find out when i get back home,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,but yes binance apparently binance throws its weight or binance is the largest crypto exchange on the planet and of course logically would be adopting the uh upgrade for the i'm gonna move on all right amazing next up in this is actually okay news uh mastercard is extending its coverage into the field of digital assets with a new agreement to acquire a crypto intelligence firm called ciphertrace the company announced on thursday the credit card company plans to close the acquisition before the end of the year to enhance its crypto capabilities for insight into more than 900 cryptos currently monitored by ciphertrace which is funded by the okay department of homeland security all right you can kind of guess where all that's going the deal will help mastercard customers and stakeholders build upon the benefit from cypher trace's solutions as consumers build their own virtual asset offerings cypher trace was i didn't have to read all that so for cypher trace uh not block stream almost star stream uh cypher trace glass node and there's one other really popular one these are basically companies that appeared out of seemingly nowhere,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,but it's coordinated uh to basically track cryptocurrency transactions their entire point is to see where money is going or to try and figure out who owns what address to be able to uh relay it back to the proper authorities um and now mastercard has acquired them uh we don't get much mastercard news we did in 2019 and also early 2020 before you know what happened um but mastercard and visa are very deep into the cryptocurrency space visa even more so visas buying nfts,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,and they're throwing all their money onto all these projects and stuff like that mastercard has been relatively hush-hush uh the acquisition of cypher trays basically means that they are going to be adding cryptocurrency payments at some point to their network the same exact thing that visa plans are doing this isn't me speculating they both have said before that they plan on integrating bitcoin you can find news articles from a year or so ago where the head of visa and mastercard separate companies and the new york stock exchange and the nasdaq have also said variations of bitcoin is the future crypto is is the future and we need to start integrating it in some sort of way so very smart on their part uh not the acquisition of cyber trace it's more of a visa and mastercard and paypal really realizing uh that they're not needed so much anymore as we do have blockchain and blockchain kind of uh regulates itself but we know um regulators like to know where everything is happening and where everything is going so this is why they have acquired them,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,and i'm also sure there's a whole bunch of money to be made in that as well they would not have acquired ciphertrace if there wasn't so yeah very major news uh this will not immediately affect anyone but just know for the future every transaction you have with mastercard with crypto is going to be cypher traced uh-huh let's move on why did i look down i looked down at the microphone for some reason as if it was going to tell me something all right let's move on and to finish things off in please don't don't lie to us news one of south africa's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges called luno has confirmed that it has started restricting withdrawals by clients the exchange insists the limits are meant to,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,and i quote act as a deterrent for illicit actors moving large amounts of funds within the crypto ecosystem however despite this technology mandaluno has so far refused to explain how the exchange sets the so-called dynamic risk-based limits according to a report the limits which are separate from the send limits that appear on their website were discovered by one of the exchange's clients the discovery became apparent to the client when they attempt to transfer crypto assets from a luno account to a binance while it failed so exchanges are trying to be as compliant as possible maybe sometimes a little bit too much,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,i implore you to find out the rules in your own country and if you are legally able to do so once again it might be time for you to learn how to um put your crypto onto a cold storage device or to simply take it off of cryptocurrency exchanges in general uh just as they you know because as we go forward this already has happened on coinbase and uh regulators are also trying to do this to binance as well uh you will be restricted from moving your money around you will have to message the cryptocurrency exchanges and ask them hey i am trying to buy a house i need to transfer this money to this so and so the issue is is that's your money it's not their money they confuse the idea of them custodying or holding it on their website as them being able to tell you what you can and cannot do with your own money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,so if you are legally in your country able to take your money off of a cryptocurrency exchange custody it yourself or even find a way to put it some other place where you feel that is it is explicitly safe and you have immediate access to it you might want to look into that because this is going to get bigger and bigger as time goes on they're ready have you ever been in the situation before we spoke about this already uh where you're trying to transfer money through your normal bank account and you can't when when it's too big and then the bank blocks your account or they call you and say hey we noticed you were trying to send money that's yours but you can't do that so where are you sending the money it's happened multiple times to me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,it's quite annoying um and once again if you are able to you know not have to deal with that i would look into that because uh nearly all major cryptocurrency exchanges have banking charters so you can kind of guess where all that's going that's why i said please don't lie to us the the the entire idea of the illicit actors or for illegal things is nonsense people are buying couches people are buying cars like we've even had we've even had before with um cypher trace and glass node and there's another whatever the third company is they came forward two years ago uh because authorities kept on saying that the majority of activity on on cryptocurrency whatever in general uh was illegal and people were buying things they shouldn't be buying and doing things they shouldn't be doing and these companies came forward and they were like yeah it's it's 0.05 of transactions are maybe going to things that are bad everyone else is just buying normal things or buying flights and stuff like that or whatever people are buying with their crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
P-d4SAqiv3c,so yeah as long as you are legally able to do it in your country why not go for it alrighty i do hope that you all enjoyed i should be back soon i think i'll be back soon i hope i'm back soon hope you all enjoyed hope you all are having a great day a great morning a great afternoon or great evening wherever you are wherever you might be i do hope that it is absolutely fantastic thank you all once again for watching listening and supporting and i will most certainly be talking to you all soon see you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw, hello everybody welcome back for another video hope you're all doing well and that you're all having a great day this is a requested videos we've been requested quite a few times I do apologize that I have not gotten to this quicker a lot of people have been asking me how exactly do they cash out of the market once the market has gone up this is not to be you know a comprehensive guide I don't go too deep into it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,but these are the methods that I have found that a lot of other people have been using some of them that I have used myself and these I think are at least the safest ways or I try to I pretty much blanket cover some of the easiest ways to if the cryptocurrency market goes up to a certain amount if the market gets too hot and you decide that you want to pull your money out to be able to get some of your profits back these are kind of the simplest ways to kind of do it first up we have a coin base for those who do not know coin base is probably the largest cryptocurrency exchange that we have in the world right now they're also one of the most trusted they are the most not verified they have gone through all the legal hoops that they have to go through they're located in the United States but they still allow for international purchases and stuff like that as well they definitely handle people in the US if you are in the European Union and as well as if you are in the UK if I'm not mistaken a couple of days ago they also just added British pounds as well for people I know a couple of people in Europe who have also used coin base and they said that they had no issue at all I guess it has to be something on the lines of transfers I have not heard any complaints from people using coin base and people in the US should as well no coin base as well I recommend them simply because of how simple they are if you actually sign up and go through their website it's very basic there's nothing difficult about it everything is pretty much clear in your face like everything is kind of laid out it's nothing you won't be using coin base if you're trying to do something difficult or something that takes a lot of effort or something that you have to know technical skills about everything in on coin base is pretty much like there's an option for by there's also an option for sell there's an option for this is an option for that it's one of the easiest crypto places that I've ever seen in my entire life they've definitely done well to give you just exactly what you need and nothing more on the entire thing of coinbase they do have a verification process as many of these other things do if you have been in crypto for a while or if you are how do I say this if you were planning on taking out a significant amount of money if the market goes up or even right now depending on when you were trying to cash out the these websites have ways for you to verify your identity and it's usually through showing your passport showing a state ID or showing your country's ID sometimes you can also get in contact with them as well to kind of expedite the process or tell them if you have a particular you know I am in this country,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,but I also live here can I also do this and is this possible there customer support has gotten a lot better over the last couple of years because they were a bit slow before but coinbase has kind of ramped it up I know a lot of people may have issues with coinbase but coinbase is one of the easiest if you have not signed up with coinbase and are looking at to sign up with coinbase I have a link in the description below it makes it a lot easier for you and also yeah this is coinbase is probably like I said people have had issues with them in the past but I would rate them at least a b-plus plus if not a solid a simply because of how simple and easy their entire process is next up if you are in the United States I would also recommend Gemini a lot of people we were talking about Gemini a couple of weeks ago a lot of people say that they definitely trust Gemini they have been using them for quite some time Gemini is also very basic they don't have a lot of coins,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,but I'm going to get that hopefully in a couple of seconds pretty much if you are holding Bitcoin or aetherium or they've also just recently added Zed Cash you're looking to swap out of the market relatively quick back into I believe they probably are only doing u.s. dollars so this probably pertains to people living inside of the US if you're looking for an alternative to coinbase Gemini is definitely it Gemini is not as large as coin based but they are as well-known,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,so if you're looking for everything that I'm telling you these are not random and or shady websites these are like the most well known things that we have in the cryptocurrency space and they are the most trusted a lot of these have also gone through like heavy verification with sec s and CFTC's in their own countries depending on where these things are so they are the most trusted in this is why I am telling them to you I'm not going to tell you anything that I would not use myself next up we have Kraken Kraken had a lot of issues sometime last year but since they have definitely revamped their entire website they offer I believe if I'm not mistaken they're also located in the United States but they offer a very large amount of coins that other US exchanges do not so if you're looking for a place where you can trade tons of coins and/or get a large number of other coins to be able to trade into I would definitely recommend Kraken at the moment they are supporting euros as well as SEPA which is very good as well and Swift if you live inside of Europe you know that you need to have long strings of code of numbers now in order to be able to transfer and they do support this they also support the US dollar the Japanese yen and Canadian dollars as well which can be very important I do apologize that I don't have more for people in Canada or in South America and/or Africa there aren't a lot of options for these countries or rather I do not live in these places so I cannot tell you for certain what the most trusted things are so this is what I'm trying to cover as many potential bases as I possibly can I would definitely recommend Kraken like I said give them a try if you need to or even look around online as always do your own research and figure out exactly which place is right for you before you put your money into them but Kraken has been around for quite some time they've revamped their entire website things are a lot cleaner a lot smoother a lot quicker,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,and I think they are definitely one of the most well known exchanges in the cryptocurrency space next up for those who are in Germany and are not looking to use coinbase and or maybe not even Gemini maybe even Kraken,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,and you feel a lot more comfortable with this you probably should already know Bitcoin boom-de-ay this is like the easiest place it is very basic it's a very simple website I mean everything you kind of need is really there there's nothing really technical about it you pretty much click buy and/or sell and the thing kind of goes through they ask you for your bank details or whatever the case might be it is definitely one of the most trusted especially if you have just moved even to them a day as they do allow euros there are a lot of other people you can see little flag right here from other European countries who are also allowed to buy sell and trade on Bitcoin boom-de-ay as well so that is not just restricted to people living within Germany or in german-speaking countries but it's for everyone within Europe it is a very basic layout don't expect anything spectacular from this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,but it's very like if you need to buy and or sell and have money go directly into your bank account this is what you would want to use depending on how comfortable you feel compared to coinbase or any of the other places if you are in France and you go to Bitcoin point FL you can see that they also have a number of other places that they recommend for people to use to buy and sell crypto currencies not only selling it but also being able to switch back into your local currency they recommend Kraken like I said Bitcoin can get a bit stamp which is something that I'm not familiar with so if you have used bits down before and you feel comfortable with it please let people know in the comment section below pay Miam comm that I am also not familiar with coin house at i/o local bitcoin is also a another place that you can use this is typically one please know the laws regarding local bitcoins dot-com in your own country simply because a lot of places have actually banned local bitcoin or their governments are not comfortable with the transactions that are happening we had an instance a couple of weeks ago where somewhere k-member the country they had their police force stopped a man in the street because they said that he was trying to launder money so typically if you are interested in selling around one two three four maybe five hundred dollars and/or euros local bitcoins could be the place for you especially if you're not really interested in doing an entire verification process in order to be able to cash out of your money local bitcoin is very very popular it is very well known I think they also have not verification processes but they have like a like a ranking,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,so if someone has transactions with at least 25 people you will be able to see them as well so you know that they are relatively trusted and you're not just meeting some random person on the street and handing them cash they also have coinbase listed as well it says books simply fee a which is like a simplified exchange it is very easy to use and they actually offer I think even one more coin it actually says over here right now to get slightly more technical not even really more technical another thing that I would suggest I know a lot of people right now are dealing in out coins and as we know coin base doesn't have a lot of out coins now that does Gemini Kraken has an okay amount,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,but they're not as out there as many other exchanges they still have a certain set of coins that they are offering and it's not around 100 or so another option that I would suggest would be to download the Exodus wallet Exodus is absolutely great they update once a week so the entire thing is you know constantly new constantly refresh they make sure to constantly patch things to make sure that your money is safe they also have options as well for you to be able to write long passwords so that your money is even safer in using Exodus what I would suggest is I'm gonna show you for one second they have a list of all the coins that they actually support I will not read through all of them they have Bitcoin litecoin Ethier IAM - golem all gordy cred eos is something we'll talk about in another video what it says right here is not bad,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,but it's something we'll talk about later Omi's they go bat salt Bitcoin cash Ethan areum classic Bitcoin gold tons of others they also just recently added if I'm not mistaken ripple x RP and stellar lumens two of the most requested coins for Exodus the point is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,is that if you find yourself having any of these coins you may find it very difficult to cash out at coin base or on crackin or any other place that you were trying to get fiat currency sent back to your bank account what I would recommend is to simply if you have your coins on here if you decide to put your coins in download Exodus you are actually able to swap your money back and forth with in Exodus directly without actually having to go through a cryptocurrency exchange for those who can see it says aetherium swapping into Bitcoin cash sometimes Exodus does have slightly higher fees they say that it has to do with the network they give like exact network visas sometimes it may be a bit higher than you would like to pay but for the convenience let's say in a scenario where you have a coin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,and you find yourself in a position where you have made twenty five thousand dollars and you are trying to figure out how to cash out quickly you would simply be able to swap that coin into Bitcoin and if you have a coin base account send that money to coin base and have coinbase send you that money directly to your bank account hope I said that pretty clear I definitely definitely recommend Exodus I it's without a doubt one of the most beautiful wallets that I've ever seen in a very long time they have a lot of features they're always adding new coins and they make sure to only add new coins once the once their network is stable so they're not just adding anything random they make sure that they are verified well known projects that they have out there so this is this is kind of the end-all when it kind of comes to everything I know a lot of people like I've said before not a lot of people own around 35 Bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,but they may own around 35 Bitcoin gold or some other coin that is not yet supported on coin based on Gemini on Kraken so what I would recommend this is me is to simply download Exodus have your money on Exodus and should the time come and you're looking for a very quick swap so that you can dump your money back into coin base to send it to your bank account this is one of the easiest ways that I found to cash out of the market and it'll probably be this way for quite some time until these major exchanges end up having around 30 40 50 60 70 different alt coins but as of now it may take a bit of effort a couple of clicks but this is the easiest way for you to get your money back into your bank account the last thing - is also a very large cryptocurrency exchange if I'm not mistaken there either number one or two compared to coin base in the world right now they're extremely popular they have mentioned many times before that they are adding fiat support I guess because of the rules and regulations within the United States they have announced that they're going to be trying to add euro support as in Fiat pairing so you'll also be able to then send them euros by coins and also swap out of that to send euros to your bank account I assumed as time goes on you will then be able to as well send US dollars in Japanese yen what have you but at the moment if you are looking to use coin by Nance I would definitely recommend them as well but then also I mean the cryptocurrency space for what it's worth is still in its infancy it's still relatively new so all the kinks have not been worked out but it can be very simplified in the easiest ways that I found or that I've offered to tell a lot of people like I said this is not or these are not the only ways for you to cash out of the market these are just some of the easiest ways in most simplified ways I tried to tell you the largest and or most well-known crypto changes that we have out there and this is kind of what it comes down to I would definitely recommend buy Nance coinbase Kraken and also downloading Exodus or maybe even reading through the exodus website to do your own research and figuring out if you want to use this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cWlcillUtdw,but I definitely recommend them because it is a very easy way to not only deal and altcoins but be able to swap between out coins from the comfort of your desktop and not actually having to sign into an exchange and then being able to swap directly back into Bitcoin that you can then send to coin base to send back to your bank account I hope I helped really I hope I helped um thank you once again everyone for watching and are listening I hope you guys all have a great day morning afternoon and or evening wherever you are wherever you might be thank you once again for watching and or listening and I will talk to you all soon see you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_rZFSzbAqlw, hello everybody welcome back for another video hope you're all doing well and that you're all having a great day this has been a discussion that's been going on for a couple of days now recently for those who are unaware the mega bank JPMorgan Chase announced that they were going to be creating their own coin people say that it's not a cryptocurrency that I won't be using blockchain so I will refer to it as the JP Morgan coin and apparently this is being done because they are trying to JP Morgan not only trying to destroy Bitcoin but also to get rid of the company ripple and also to get rid of the token known as XRP so I've broadly not really gone over this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_rZFSzbAqlw,it's kind of a very weird discussion however because people are incredibly interested in this topic Brad Garlin house was actually talking about this about a day ago discussing the actual use cases for the JP Morgan coin and without further ado let's jump right into it ripple CEO Brad Garlin House says that JP Morgan's new digital asset is great publicity for the blockchain and cryptocurrency space but he believes that's where the coins value begins and ends at DC blockchain summit 2019,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_rZFSzbAqlw,Garlin House said that there's no chance that JPM coin will reach mass adoption because other banks and financial institutions aren't interested in using it he said and I do quote let me start by saying I think it's great for the blockchain and crypto industry to have players like JP Morgan leaning in thumbs up that's great that's the only nice thing I'm going to say about this I got asked last week I was speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference and somebody asked me there were a lot of headlines about JP and coin this guy was from Morgan Stanley who was interviewing me I said so is Morgan Stanley going to use the JPM coin he said probably not well is City going to use JPM coin is Bank of America going to use JPM coin is PNC the answer is no,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_rZFSzbAqlw,and so does that mean we're going to all have different coins and does that mean we're going back to where we are where there's a lack of interoperability don't get it in quote an addition Garlin house says he's struggling to find a coherent use case for JPM coin even if the goal is to have it used internally at JPMorgan he said one more quick thing on JPM coin so let's think about this JPM coin they announced for institutional clients if you gave them a dollar deposit they'll give you a JPM coin that you can then move within the JPM ledger he said wait a minute just use the dollar I really don't understand if you're just giving just moving it within the JPM ledger and it has to be $1 $2 and 1/2 I'm backing I don't understand what problem that solves end quote last month reports surfaced that JPMorgan is starting a new trial that will utilize the company's digital asset JPMorgan coin to settle transactions with his wholesale business clients the blockchain based solution payment solution was initially will initially be tested with a tiny fraction of the company's clientele so the situation that we have right now as we slowly learn more about the JP Morgan coin first of all uh I find it hard to believe that other banks would be using JP Morgan's coins simply because other banks don't like JP Morgan Chase and other banks it's kind of a weird situation like you're probably not gonna find a scenario where Bank of America or PNC are going to agree to use another banks cryptocurrency especially when the weird part is is that the JP Morgan coin is supposed to only be used internally within the JP Morgan Space website and app whatever what-have-you they're saying that it's for quick transfers obviously though I mean it's it's just a really weird situation when it comes to Jamie Dimon who's the CEO of JP Morgan he said that he hated Bitcoin and crypto currencies for a very long time he thought that crypto currencies had no use and now they have tried are trying to create their own crypto currency and I don't know if I can call it a crypto currency especially because as according to reports if you kind of look around it appears that this is only going to be used internally and even more so the people who are going to be allowed to use this will be some of the very richest people who are actually like it says even right here like large institutional JPMorgan clients we can assume that eventually they're probably going to roll out something where everyone on their platform and not just very rich people are able to use the JPMorgan coin but it seems very weird that you would have to have US Dollars and then swap them into the coin and then I don't know it seems a bit pointless I mean we don't know exactly what they're planning this is not the first time that JPMorgan has kind of hinted at something like this has done something similar to this they haven't created their own coin before this feels like an attention-grabbing money grab if that kind of makes any sense in the foreseeable future I do not see a scenario where other banks around the world or even within the United States especially if you've ever watched a documentary on how banks really run they are probably not too keen on listing another banks who they're usually not at war with but you know everyone likes to have their own profits in the banking industry like they're not trying to share customers that they would even think about using another banks coin and this is why crypto currencies and also XRP included are very interesting because the entire idea is that if you all use just one thing and that's kind of agnostic and not exactly through the banking industry you can transfer money between yourselves I have a very strong feeling at some point my you know just my opinion Brad Garlin how has probably met Jamie Dimon at some point and according to rumors Jamie Dimon is probably not the nicest person in the entire world so they probably had a little exchange of words and now this is what JP Morgan I have,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_rZFSzbAqlw,I mean I really have no idea but like I said Jamie Dimon this is not the first time that he's done something like this I wouldn't be shocked if JP Morgan coin does launch and it's only amongst JP Morgan which is kind of pointless is kind of just you know just announce it you have a quicker way to send money or if this does try to launch it it ends up taking them a very long time just the kind of my opinion anyway cousin I talk about it for a little bit everyone this is this is like a major discussion it's also very very weird I don't understand crypto politics as much as I think I even want to there are a lot of people who are advocates for Bitcoin anythi reham who are now praising JPMorgan coin saying that they would rather see JP Morgan coin thrive more than XRP when XRP isn't a bank and JP Morgan Chase actually is like JP Morgan is directly responsible for the reason why we even have crypto currencies so um yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_rZFSzbAqlw,I think that's definitely do it for this video I hope you all enjoyed hope you all are having a great day a great morning a great afternoon a great evening wherever you are wherever you might be hope it's absolutely fantastic thank you all once again for watching and listening I'm pretty sure this is going to develop more and more as time goes on this is not the last time that we are going to hear about JP Morgan coin but yeah I'll talk to you soon see you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU, what's going on everyone my name is nicholas merton here at datadash and today is october 21st of 2021 well folks i hope you are having a fantastic day wherever you are and i want to start off by saying happy new all-time highs we broke through the previous all-time highs at 65k just yesterday and it smashed up towards 67 000.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,it's not only an exciting time and one we should definitely celebrate but it feels good because we stood to our conviction that we weren't in a bear market and that this was just a mere mid-cycle correction albeit a heavier one than usual that all being said i don't want to sit here and champion our previous predictions or talk about how the markets at all-time highs what i want to focus on is what a lot of people aren't talking about because most get caught up in the euphoria i want to talk about cutting the emotions out of the equation and focusing on the key things and principles that you should be following in this case in order to make sure you come out of this cycle with life-changing returns the biggest problem that people have when it comes to crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,is they don't follow a few key simple principles and this is also traditional markets the problem is that they don't follow a few key simple principles and they end up giving back everything that they earned they don't have a game plan established so we're going to be talking about that throughout this video and how you can best prepare yourself and i thought what better way to do this than to write up a twitter thread so if you guys haven't already you guys can follow me on twitter to get this stuff when it comes out at nicholas underscore merton and i put a quick thread together it's just a couple key points we'll run through it here quite quickly throughout the video on how to actually prepare going into the next couple of months to the next year so first off we're going to talk about the first principle having a clear exit strategy now there are really two types of scenarios here that we're going to be talking about today if you're if you're day trading in this case uh you better know what exit strategies are we don't even talk about day trading here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,it's just not something that i would recommend you guys and it's a generally losing game for most people so we're going to talk about two key things here swing traders we're going to talk about the long-term investors now if you're a long-term investor and your dollar cost averaging a crypto your your you know your take profit position is maybe for big ticket expenses like buying a home one day retirement something like that that's far out and you're willing to ride this cycle the bear mark and keep averaging in then you're perfectly fine in this case you keep doing that and i would actually say that we're building a feature within digifox my crypto wallet called get paid in crypto that's going to allow you to get a portion of your payroll from your job in the form of your favorite cryptos like bitcoin ethereum and litecoin so if you guys are interested in that we've got a wait list uh that you guys can sign up for by downloading the application there'll be a link down below if you want to download digifox,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,but if you're you know like myself to be completely free i do a bit of dollar cost averaging from time to time at least i can average into the market in this case but one of the other things that i do and i'm very much more active than most people in is swing trading and i generally like to ride the broader waves of the cycle and know generally when you take profits and re-enter after major discounts right to where it's incredibly favorable in this case if you know how to spot these signs to where you can bolster your portfolio in this case and protect your actual profits this is the biggest problem that people don't tackle on when they're encrypted because they get emotionally invested in their crypto and outside as well there's this kind of weird aura around crypto because it's a very tribal asset class compared to others where you have huddle mentality and you have all these people telling you just don't sell just don't sell you can't do it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,it's wrong in this case and guys look when you're making an investment in a digital asset like crypto whether it be bitcoin ethereum you name it or your favorite altcoin or if you're investing a stock or any other type of asset that can move up and down in price you have every right and i don't care what people tell you of every right to be able to sell your asset if you so choose albeit you will have to consider in this case that it might keep going up it could go down to your benefit in this case maybe you can add at a discount,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,and you're going to have tax obligations most likely those are all realities of profit taking so long as you understand those there's nothing wrong with it just like how it was okay if you didn't buy it in the first place so that's something that i see a lot of people fall victim to and the sense of actually building strategy on how you know how to build an exit strategy in this case you guys can check a video we put out we got a lot of using this one where we talked about building a crypto exit strategy it's on the data dash channel it's a nice uh you know 30 something minute video that will go through and talk about the details of how i personally think most people should generally look at it again it's not direct financial advice and you might want to customize it to your own needs,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,but that's one of the key things that most people don't have well before the euphoric period you should have this established because in many cases an exit strategy is going to involve taking profits ahead of time that's what a hit on here is a pro tip keep your price targets conservative and i put a little mental experiment here basically half of what your peers on telegram are are shooting for so if you're in those telegram groups you get your favorite altcoin they're saying it's going to a hundred dollars it's going to 50 bucks i would rather shoot for 50 to 25 bucks in this case much more conservative target even though it's still probably great from wherever you bought it right so again keep your estimations conservative more than your peers that's a good mental exercise to see if you're like keeping away from the euphoric segment of the crypto space,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,all right so next up here don't get caught two steps behind now i'm not going to hit too much on this we just did a video actually on it yesterday in reference to bitcoin versus all coins and again it was an emotional argument it wasn't about oh i love all coins or i love bitcoin or you know i'm i'm personally exposed here and that's why i like this no it was simply about making sure that if we found ourselves and i'll be very humble in this case we've been in altcoins right uh generally speaking through almost the market it's paid us major dividends in this case it's been a huge return compared to just being in bitcoin that being said although that's the case we've had a little bit of a pullback here in all coins from around 60 dom and it's down to 53 the video we talk about how we don't want to find ourselves two steps behind we don't want to switch from all coins you know realizing this bitcoin loss going to bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,and then all coins start to kick up again right that's being two steps behind rather than one step and then eventually working your way back to the right direction getting back to where you were and possibly climbing higher that's the objective we want to keep progressing right we do not want to get our emotions in the way where we find ourselves two steps behind and just since yesterday's video all coin dominance has balanced off the exact support range we talked about this key support line again you guys can watch the video for the kind of intimate details there but we've seen a nice bounce here mainly led by ethereum ethereum's up 7.6 against bitcoin lo and behold it happens right after there's peak euphoria in bitcoin with the list of bito which is the first bitcoin etf what do you know a little bit of buy the rumor sell the news type event reallocation all coins circulation of capital into all coins and in this whole rally in this case ethereum is pressing back all-time highs as well it looks like it might be charted for new highs and new price discovery just like bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,right so again i'm not playing emotional favorites here i'm just making sure in this case that for my portfolio i'm not going to catch myself two steps behind so anyways we talked about that there again patience and conviction is really important third one,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,and you guys know if you're avid fans or viewers of the channel leverage trading this is the third thing it almost should almost be the number one lesson that you guys should take into mind and take to heart and i'll say this i'm not a financial advisor but this is financial advice because i'm going to go ahead and say something very clear here there are a lot of people who are promoting derivatives or leveraged trading platforms especially those like myself or u.s citizens who should not be doing that and outside of that as well is promoting services that are legal in that jurisdiction now we can sit here and debate overall about the regulatory environment of leveraged trading or you know why regulators would suppress it and whether it's right or wrong and if people should be able to take the risk they want but look i'm going to go ahead and give you guys my take on leverage trading okay leverage trading is a losing game notice how in the earlier part of the video i did not promote the idea of day trading,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,right i've tried to day trade before there's some markets where i make money and i can generally successfully day trade but the stress time and consumption of your life that goes into it and outside it as well if you do happen to be that you know five ten percent that can make money trading you likely will not be able to outpace just averaging in the market especially in a hyper volatile hyper expansive and high growth market like crypto i'm gonna go ahead and put it out there guys you see all this posts on twitter from people who are sharing their referral links promoting the use of leverage and for those who don't know in this case it's basically borrowing capital to increase your risk exposure to your underlying investments right it sounds great on paper you see all these people talking about cool i made four or five million dollars today,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,well they're people with a lot of money and you want to know how they got it they probably got it shilling their referral links to buy bit to ftx to bit max to you know all the leverage streaming platforms phoenix you name it and i want to make it very clear guys none of them are affiliates to our channel we don't work with them and you're never going to see that promoted here because to be honest it would be like promoting a casino on my referral links right so again um just take it with the action here that i don't actively leverage trade right i would never promote that to you guys in this case right so again the key thing here taking this as a whole it's a losing game right and one kind of harsh and healthy i use in this case like imagine that i told you if you walked across a tight rope in this case and whatever amount of money you could carry in a backpack you could you know multiply 20 30 50x in this case but if you fall off that tight rope you lose it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,all right you know your life savings the amount of money you put are you really going to do that right and maybe put chump change in this case like you know like a couple bucks here and there but to be honest guys generally i'd rather play my odds in this case on winning out long term and building up a substantial portfolio and that's the mentality of again either swing trading or dollar cost averaging and again if you guys are interested in that a winning strategy that beats out the market 88 to 90 percent of the time dollar cost averaging is a solid bet so you beat up 90 of the market just like that really incredible stuff all right the fourth one here is don't revenge trade this is something i have been definitely guilty of whether it be in equities or crypto i'm going to be very critical of myself i've had that happen before in this case where i get emotional and for example,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,i uh you know for example will not have sold the top and and something's going down and buy into it this is basically when for example you either don't get the return you're expecting from an investment or you take a loss and what you then go by on and do is one of two things either you try to reinvest back into the asset at another price or maybe when the momentum comes back and then usually statistically speaking will lose again by the time you actually sell that given asset or you go on and take greater levels of risk you start speculating on smaller assets in this case that are more volatile more high risk and potentially high return you start utilizing as we just talked about leverage in order to increase the chances of your returns and the really problem uh problematic thing that i've seen and i think a great example that i could show you guys here is total market cap is how much this will warp your perception and we'll go back to that first point that we talked about or that might have been the second point which was don't get caught two steps behind,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,so we'll give a great example of this right we're riding towards all-time highs long-term investors you've been here on the journey in this case you've been unaffected you've been holding those positions right you are now in many cases whether bitcoin or altcoins either near all-time highs or at all-time highs in your portfolio value bravo to that right the problem that many people had was back here in may when the correction came through many people panic sold their positions predicting that it was a bear market without any serious confirmation not waiting for a rebound a higher a lower high in this case right we had a pretty fast correction people sold their positions and guess what they did afterwards they were so confident in the conviction that they sold the emotional side in this case they started to short bitcoin and other crypto assets at the bottom now i'm not here to criticize you guys if you guys were in this basket in this case of individuals i've been there with you i'm not here trying to bash or belittle anyone i found myself two steps behind i had to learn everything the hard way the key point i want to mention here is that we should always generally be contrarians to the emotional sentiment of the market and not find ourselves two steps behind and not try to revenge on losses or paper gains that we lost right because in this case whereas people's expectations are that they're gonna go with the trend in this case the clear momentum right now the reality tends to be very different,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,and we were one of the few people who were holding our convictions here at the 1.2 trillion dollar mark and broadly speaking the 30 dollar support range for bitcoin one of the few people who said guys this is a range to watch do not fall two steps behind all right and luckily it's paid off very well in fact we added more in this case on the lows we averaged into the market,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,right so again key point there right don't revenge trade don't don't uh don't badge yourself if you make a 5x versus a 10x because all you need after that is to take those locked in profits and go find somewhere else where you can make 100 return and in crypto or even equities if you play it right that is really not that hard to do within a year to your time frame sometimes in a matter of weeks or months if you're really good at uh picking the right plays all right now let's go ahead and talk about what i think is on a moral level one of the most important things you guys can do okay now i understand at the end of the day depending on where you live what your financial situation is everyone's got a different standard of living everyone's got different desires for where they want to be in life and to be honest everyone at their core has got their own problems and financial costs one thing that's so great about crypto compared to any other market is the kind of returns you can make in this exponential market you're just not going to see equity markets double within a year whereas in crypto can double multiple times over in a given cycle because of this people have made really you can't say it any other way life-changing returns,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,i know i've done great in crypto and many other people have done green crypto so one thing i really want to encourage is that you do something charitable now i'm a big fan of you know reinvesting and building really valuable companies or supporting certain initiatives that you really like but one of the things that i really recommend is checking out kiva now kiva is a non-profit organization and its focus is to help support microfinancing loans this basically means that you can put in 25 50 100 bucks or a much more substantial recurring amount on a monthly basis towards hundreds if not thousands of different borrowers across the world who are in much much less fortunate situations that i would say probably most of us are right who aren't invested in crypto who will miss this journey in a lot of ways and this investment opportunity and outside of that don't have the time to think about investing in crypto they're trying to go out there and make a better life for their family and friends and i'm not trying to stand here in a big spot i'm absolutely philanthropic and stuff,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,but i think that this is something we can all do and what i've committed to is as we go into the bear market we start to lock in profits i want to start making monthly contributions that and this is the cool part you can not only make monthly contributions so you're allocating a bit of your savings or your net worth every single month into it but here's the cool catch it's not just a charitable donation to give to someone where the money goes away it helps one off and then it's done we have to put more money in what's cool about this is that you can re-lend out the capital once the borrower has repaid you and it has generally around a 98 99 payback rate so you're not earning any interest,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,right so you're losing a little bit out to inflation but you're going towards making leaps and bounds for people across the world in ways that are unthinkable and unimaginable so again i really think that you know in this case um there's a lot of great innovations like equity crowd funding microfinancing microfinancing is one of my favorite in this case to leave an impact on the world you know a couple hundred bucks in this case to some of us may not be that much by the end of the cycle a couple thousand dollars right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,but that will go leaps and bounds to help people so anyways there's a link down below in the description if you guys want to join our team in this case we've got team digifox where we're all helping to pitch in and make monthly contributions and i'm making automatic recurring loans i put in about like 2 000 per month and i'm going towards doing different types of charitable loans and i'm hoping to increase that as we go towards the end of the cycle and i'd love if you guys want to join me and whatever level you can contribute whether it's a couple bucks here and there or a substantial amount we'd love to get that community building and stuff so anyways guys that's it for today's video enough rambling again if you guys like this kind of content you should not only consider subscribing hitting the bell icon but you can also follow me over on twitter at nicholas underscore burton that's the real one no datadash profiles or anything that's my twitter at nicholas underscore merton and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XU-LKhm2WUU,uh yeah guys that's gonna be it for today's video if you liked it drop a like and uh if you guys have a tidbit of information like a tip that everyone should follow you think leave it down below in the comments i want to get that discussion going and um yeah guys thank you guys so much for the continued love here on the channel i've loved being able to do this over the past couple years and i can't wait to create even more content as we go in to new all-time highs and new price discovery within crypto that being said everyone have a great rest of your day and i'll see you all in the next one take care everyone you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,"welcome back guys have you ever heard that beacon is this perfect tool for criminals because beacon is an anonymous currency that they can use and do their nefarious activities without getting caught well it is completely wrong because today I will be showing you the tools you need to have if you want to track criminals on the blockchain you need to understand that bitcoin is the most open currency in the world all transactions are being written to the blockchain and they are stuck in the blockchain forever and anyone can try to analyze them and anyone can try to make sense of the different money flows that are happening anyone can follow the money flows in real time and today I will be showing the tools that the police FBI IRS and other law enforcement agencies are using today so we'll be using the latest technologies out there so that being said let's look at a very interesting transaction we'll be looking at a criminal transaction that happened on the blockchain in in May so this was 7th May 2019 as you can see we have millions and millions of dollars being transmitted all in all approximately 53 million dollars being sent and if you convert that to Bitcoin approximately 7,000 Bitcoin and this is the address that is getting drained as you can see this is the address that is creating all of these inputs to the Biskind transaction and then the money from this from this one particular address is just being split up and sent to these different Angeles right here now if we look at what kind of address this is we can use just a normal block Explorer for example blockchain comm or whatever block Explorer you want really but if we look at this address you quickly understand that this is not a normal address because it has so many transactions going in and out all the time all in all this address has received over Sen million Bitcoin 7 million Bitcoin and sent over 7 million Bitcoin as well",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,so this is an exchange address and more more precisely this is an address that belongs to two by Nance this is a bye Nance wallet and here is where by Nance hold there holder crypto so we do see a significant hack that happened because this is a hack if you look at what happened to to Bitcoin and you look at the news you look at a particular period in time we you quickly understand that this was indeed a hack because if you go to Google and then you go to news and you search in May what happened to Bitcoin you see that - was hacked now I get results in Swedish,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,but you see that hackers stole 40 million of Bitcoin from one of the world's largest exchanges so this this is a balanced hack that happened now what kind of tools can we use in order to track this how can we be a bit smart and how can we see what is happening on the blockchain now there is a brilliant tool that I recommend everyone to learn if you're interested in this you go to Google or you just open your web browser and then you search or exceed that me you go into the address field and you enter or if you see that me and you go here now it will tell you that you injuries a bigger resolution just zoom out but because I have it in a side window so this is all to see that me now the good thing is here is that if we copy the transaction ID the hash of this transaction we can get a very very nice visual representation so I click here and then I paste the transaction ID and then I search,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,and I get some information I mean basically the same information I get in the blush and come explore but the good thing here is this little button right here tools if you click here you will be getting a visual representation of this transaction this is very important so here's the transaction but we don't get a lot of information if I just hover over this transaction let me actually zoom in a bit so you can see better so this is a tool that by the way law enforcement will use so if I hover over this transaction I see how much Bitcoin is sent and what block it is basically and that's it but if I double click I will be getting a lot of inch information I will be getting a lot a lot of entry information so what are we seeing right here we're seeing crazy stuff,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,but this is basically this information right here being visualized in in a graphical way so as you can see we do have arrows pointing into this circle and arrow spots pointing out of the circle so this circle in the middle is the actual transaction so this circle in the middle is is basically the transaction the this one and the transaction has a bunch of inputs basically money being put into this transaction and this is all the arrows that are pointing inwards,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,and then you have a few arrows point pointing outwards for example this one or for example this one and arrows pointing outwards are these transactions because in Bitcoin you know you can send the money from many different people to many different people in one transaction because you can pull money from many different addresses and then you can send money to many different addresses all in one because you have inputs and then you have outputs it's very special this is not how your bank bank works in your bank you just have sender and receiver in Bitcoin you can have a bunch of different senders and a bunch of different receivers but here you do have one address basically being used for all the inputs and then different addresses four outputs but what's interesting now is that we can try to see what is happening to this money I mean where do all of this outputs go as you can see the fat arrows will indicate you the big the big outputs,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,so I mean this is quite a big arrow and in order to remember what we have seen I recommend using this check mark right here because if I click it now it will be colored so if you see this this output is sending away a 500 Bitcoin but there are several outputs I mean this output is sending away is 300 Bitcoin let's mark that let's see what else we got another output right here sending away 400 Bitcoin and what we can try to do is to try to see okay what is happening next and we can try to follow the trail of this money so as you can see we we get money flowing from this hack in one transaction here and then we have another input also being used in this transaction right here from the hack so we do have two inputs that are that are that are consisting of hacked money this one and this one so basically they are pooling all the money from the hack that happened right here into into another transaction that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,"and we can all follow it so if I now check we do have this flow of money right here let's try to see other flows of money that that is that are going from the same transaction okay here's another one let's see where that one is going so just double click and and we can get a good understanding also try to mark all of them so that you can clearly see later on so this and then like this so we have some money going in that direction some money going in that direction so we do have two big outflows so here you have an outflow for 1,000 Bitcoin being being transacted into into nowhere basically because all of these transactions happen after the hack but you can still follow them and so you have one trail right here then you have a second trail right here and then you can see how this hacker is trying to is trying to make it look so that from the outside you cannot see which which amounts or hacked and which are not hacked so we do see two big trails over here this trail and that trail",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,"and so what you can do is just sit here and try to find more trails so for example here's another arrow going outwards let's see where this one goes they are pooling money together here and then they get another trail right here so you can you can follow that and although this is kind of the method you're using here's another potentially big transaction yes so this this one is big 1,000 Bitcoin being pulled away yes here here it is so as you can see now we have we have a good understanding there are basically four main channels that the money is flowing through and the each of this I mean this channel is 1,000 Bitcoin this channel right here carries 1000 Bitcoin this channel right here is 700 so you can click around and you can find the other the other channels as well because all in all we do see 7,000 Bitcoin being stolen so now we can we can kind of visually see where where - 3000 is going because we have 1,000 1007 or actually here we have another one let's check this one yeah",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,so we have one k here we have one k here we have one k here and then we have seven so four thousand four thousand between all unknown is just moving from here from the stolid buns into this other other clusters and so what you will soon find is that the behavior of these transactions is quite quite interesting because if we just follow one of these trails what they're doing is just trying to split this money into smaller and smaller addresses and it is not a normal behavior for a normal Bitcoin user to just constantly try to try to break this money up and and put it into smaller and smaller addresses so let's say that you are an exchange let's say that you for example you are a coin base and suddenly you get a deposit of off let's see this is your deposit that you're guessing you get to the posit of 42 Bitcoin using tools like oxc that me you can have a compliance person who can visually track this back and quite easily discovered this discovered this connection and then he can just go to news and see okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,"what the heck happened I mean what is this big ass transaction for 7,000 bitcoins then you can just go to use and you can find this so therefore we took tools like this with being able to visually see where the money is going and be able to to to sit here and try to understand the flows of money the job of IRS the police FBI is so much easier and that is by the way how they got the one of the largest sites for child abuse through transactions and through understanding how bit-bit contractions are connected and who is using what kind of money but all on old I mean in one way I find this beautiful because we're really going deep into the blockchain and we're seeing exactly what's happening and without tools like oxy that me that wouldn't be possible and what's funny is that actually you you might imagine that this is a tool created by by the police or law enforcement but it's fine it's actually created by samurai wallet",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,and you know the samurai wallet is one of these wallets that works a lot with privacy because if you use samurai wallet you want to be as private as possible so they basically made this tool so that if you want to be private you can practice here and you can you can see how how people might be following your transactions,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,but it is quite interesting and you also get this kind of living organism drawn visually which is the money flows in in Bitcoin and if you follow follow them long enough you see that they are trying to split it into smaller and smaller parts but if you are an exchange you are legally obligated to not accept money from from hacks for example you're not your legally obligated to know where the money of your customers is coming from so this that being said we do have some bitcoins being worth more than other Bitcoin because you understand that if it is the case that I have one of this Bitcoin right here I have one of this 355 Bitcoin I might not be able to to sell them easily because look if I if I put them on an exchange suddenly everyone will know who I am because I change just need kyc,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,and therefore they might not even be able to accept my coins but that doesn't even matter because if I do kyc I will be caught this is the like the the mindset of a criminal how they will be thinking because it's so easy to track it back to this hack right here so this means that these coins might be sold in OTC deals these coins might be sold them just on local Bitcoin or something because the these coins might be sold to someone who will just take them and and they have this risk instead have this risk of not being able to sell them later on on exchanges so we basically have a bifurcation a split and a in the network when it comes to coins because some coins you can sell easily some coins you can not sell easily because they have a bad trace so this is both good and bad,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,I mean the good thing is that it's so transparent and you can see where the dirty money is going and where it's coming from but the bad thing is that bitcoin is not really fungible because you can track where the money is coming from and so some bitcoin is worth less than other Bitcoin and they might try to sell it to people who don't really know where that money is coming from for example on local Bitcoin they might try to sell this this money for this beacon for a bit cheaper,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,and then you will see people buying quickly because I mean if you see if the criminals try to sell this 355 Bitcoin for like 5 K somewhere they will find buyers they will find buyers who will not do this kind of analysis and then those buyers will just try to deposit on exchanges and they might in turn get questions you know what where the hell is this money from why is it connected to bi'ness hack and while you as a buyer like a second-tier buyer of the obvious coins or maybe you saw the service or maybe you saw the good I mean you might you may try to explain to the exchanges that hey this is honest money I just bought it from a guy on local Bitcoin they changed my still say hey we don't really trust you I mean you yourself self might not get in trouble but you might still get attention from law enforcement they might still check it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T_3dMKCFXf0,but it's also the question I mean if you have dirty coins how many steps do you need to go for them to become a clean how many hands do they need to change but obviously if you have these dirty coins for example you bought them from somewhere I mean you you better be having some kind of documentation for that that you actually have a receipt or you have some kind of invoice that you have performed a service because otherwise how will you prove that you did not actually hack - I mean how will you be able to - to defend yourself I mean these are questions that many people don't think about but but it's important anyway guys I hope you understand a bit better I hope you understand a bit more what is happening and that being said leave your questions if you have any questions in the comment section and I'll see you all very very soon have a good day and good bye guys good bye good bye,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4, in the late 2000s a texan cardiologist hired an upholsterer to come in and reupholster the chairs in his waiting room and what he learned from this experience i think perfectly exemplifies the lesson that i learned at an at a young age if you will in my journey here in cryptocurrency and what i learned was what led me to the success that i've had in cryptocurrency,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4,so if you'll entertain me i'm gonna tell you a story about anxiety fear and waiting so dr friedman who is a cardiologist hired this upholsterer to come in and reupholster the chairs in his waiting room because they'd been there for a while just like any specialist of any kind of medical practice he had his own office and he had his own waiting room and people would wait for him to come in or for a nurse to come and receive them and he hired a reupholsterer an upholsterer to come in and reupholster the chairs and the upholsterer told dr friedman before he did any work you've got to see this i have never seen anything like this in my entire career so the upholsterer brought dr freeman out into the waiting room and he said look at where the where is on this chair instead of the wear on the chairs being in the back against the back rest the wear on the chairs was on the edge it was on the front of the seat and the upholstery said he'd never seen that because most people you know they kick back and they lean back in a chair but that wasn't the case the main period the main place of wear on these chairs was on the front and they came to the conclusion that the reason for that was because as people were waiting on the cardiologist they were sitting literally on the edge of their seat i want to encourage you really quickly if you're sitting in a chair i'm sitting in a bean bag so i can't really do it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4,but if you're sitting on a chair sit as close to the edge of your seat as you possibly can for just a second and see what it feels like see how long you would be able to maintain that pose would you be able to sit there for a week a month a year it's not very comfortable is it if you're doing it you'll know what i mean excuse me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4,i still have a bit of a cough maybe i should go see a cardiologist maybe maybe it's my heart i doubt it the point that they realized is that as people were waiting for the cardiologist they were probably feeling very anxious because they were worried about what the cardiologist would tell them because maybe their heart wasn't functioning correctly so they would wait on the edge of their seat and dr friedman said a quote that i think really explains the whole point of this video he said i wonder if people are anxious because they're at the cardiologist or are they at the cardiologist because of their anxiety what's the point here the position of our hearts and our souls and our minds and our bodies as we wait has a whole lot to do with how pleasant the weight is as the philosopher rascal flatts once said life is a highway it's not necessarily a destination because believe me i've been on a lot of highways and i've gotten to a lot of destinations and you've probably experienced the same thing you look back and you realize that 99 of the journey was the journey and the final 1 was just kind of where you got the trophy to say that you've done it how does this tie into cryptocurrency because in the title i told you guys this is how i became a millionaire in cryptocurrency and here's the point of this entire video in the same way that dr friedman postulated that perhaps the people who are at the cardiologist because of their anxiety because of how they wait i think a lot of damage will come to us as cryptocurrency traders and investors based on how we wait what do i mean by that i've been in cryptocurrency for four and a half years i've made 80 of the money i've ever made in cryptocurrency in the last 12 months seriously i made in 10 days what i made in the first two years this year just so you know that's what wading looks like the grass is not greener on the other side the grass is greener where you water it i have watered the grass of cryptocurrency i have not tried to water the grass of stock market and real estate i had a ceo of a solopreneur come to my office and seek some advice and counsel for me about building a team because he's grown his personal business to a point where he wants to bring on another employee and he told me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4,yeah well i'm thinking about doing this for another 12 months or so and then i think i'm going to go into real estate and i asked him did you come here because you want to hear what you want to hear or did you come here because you want genuine advice that you might not like and he said the latter of course i came here because i genuinely want to know what you think i am a ceo who runs a company with 16 employees i know a little bit about this i don't claim to be a professional i don't well i am a professional i don't claim to be an expert in this field but i know a few things so i told him if you stop doing what you're doing right now which you're clearly very talented at you're being successful and go to real estate that will be the biggest mistake that you've made in a long time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4,and he said why and i said because you were switching your focus halfway through i almost did the same thing a year and a half into running this channel guys the channel had 12 000 13 000 subscribers and i thought oh you know what this isn't working i'm gonna go start a shopify store i am so glad that all the facebook ads i ran to untold wild yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4,for real i was bad at naming things back then just as i am today i am so glad that i sucked at facebook ads because if i hadn't made some money doing that and gotten you know into the whole shopify bug this channel would not be here because i would have changed my focus and i would have started watering the grass somewhere else it takes time guys there is a type of chinese bamboo and you've probably seen videos of people talking about this online there's a type of chinese bamboo that you you bury it in the ground and it's a seed and it grows zero for a couple of decades but you have to water and take care of it every single day and then once it finally breaches the surface it grows 40 50 60 70 80 feet tall in the span of just a month and that's kind of what cryptocurrency is like that's kind of what making money in crypto is like it's kind of like watering a plot of soil that looks like there's nothing on it for years maybe a decade but if you do it with faith and you realize that you're waiting on something and you realize that it's not about the destination but it is about the journey and it's about the person that you become as you were on that journey then you'll really find what crypto is all about it's not about becoming a crypto millionaire it's about who you become in the process of making your millions in crypto i believe in every single one of you i th and the reason i do even though i don't specifically know you the reason,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4,i know that you can do this is because it's a formula it's repeatable it is a mathematical equation of how to make your money in crypto it just is you invest in your knowledge you invest in your wisdom you make the trades you make the investments you put the reps in you you work on your form you do all of these things and you will make money it's a formula that hundreds of thousands millions of people have followed and you can too so my christmas present to you is just a little bit of encouragement i just want you to know that if you've been in crypto for six months if you've been in crypto for a year you might need to be in it for another six months or another year before you see results but just try and get one percent better every single day and remember sitting back in the chair and utilizing that backrest is a lot more comfortable and you'll be able to wait a lot longer than if you're sitting on the edge of your seat you're about to fall off think about how your heart is positioned do you want your millions tomorrow it's probably not going to happen you're going to get your hopes up and you're going to get them crushed and the final thing i'll say is that i learned at an early age that i would much rather think that what i'm doing is going to be less enjoyable that is going to cost more than i think it's going to that it's going to take longer than i think it's going to uh that it's going to be harder than i think it's going to i would much rather be pessimistic about how something is going to go than overly optimistic about how it's going to go because no matter which one you do you're going to be surprised if you're overly pessimistic you're going to be surprised in a good way say,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4,oh i think it's going to take 10 years make a million bucks in crypto it happens in two you're going to be surprised in a pleasant way but if you're so caught up on thinking i'm going to be a crypto millionaire in six months i can tell you with about 95 certainty if you're starting from zero that's not gonna happen if you set that expectation you're gonna be unpleasantly surprised and you're gonna be much more tempted to quit when it doesn't work as quickly as you think it's going to even if it would have only taken two years the positioning of your heart could be the thing that determines whether you stick through to the end and you want to stick through to the end because financial freedom is one of the most important tools in this sinful world that we have to achieve a purpose-driven life which is our mission we want to help you guys live a purpose-driven life,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XaTtnusUmZ4,so i just encourage you to think about over your break how are you waiting how are you waiting for what you want you know what i want i want a billion dollar company that tithes ten percent gives a hundred million dollars a year to ministry and spreads the gospel all around the world that's 277 000 a day you know what we could do with that you know how much i want that to be here right now you you i promise you you have no idea how much i want that to be here now but i also realize that it's not about the destination it's about the journey and how you got there and who you became when you while you were getting there and everything you did along the way so ask yourself the question how are you waiting merry christmas guys we'll be back on monday excuse me we'll be back on tuesday we might be back on monday if the crypto market is going crazy hopefully you enjoyed this video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
xNrE2SqhECw, Dwight D Eisenhower who was one of the most successful Generals in the history of the United States military served during the second world war and became a president of the United States in the 1950s once said in preparing for battle I have found that plans are useless but planning is indispensable in this video I'm going to tell you what that quote this background has to do with Bitcoin okay well I'm sitting in my backyard right now I know what you're seeing behind me is not a green screen those are actually palm trees behind me and golly it is beautiful here in the sunny state of Florida and we're moving into summer and there's a lot of excitement that comes with that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
xNrE2SqhECw,but as any Floridian knows to have a successful summer you want to make sure you're at least somewhat prepared you want to make sure you've at least got some kind of plan now don't get me wrong you can have plenty of fun just by winging it but a lot of times it's better to have some idea of what you're going to do when the summer comes are you gonna go to the beaches are you going to go to Disney World are you going to go on a lot of motorcycle rides what is it that you're going to do it's nice to come up with some kind of idea of okay I'm going to go to Tampa I'm going to go to Clearwater I'm going to go to St Augustine what are we going to do we have some kind of plan and we can throw the plan out the window at any point,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
xNrE2SqhECw,but it's good to have those ideas in mind there's a lot of excitement when summer comes around in Florida and quite frankly there's probably even more excitement when winter comes around because it turns to 110 degrees and 110 humidity I know that's not possible but it's a joke during the summer months of Florida my point is as people go into the season that they're looking forward to they start coming up with a lot of ideas and they start making a lot of plans and that's something that Dwight D Eisenhower relied was realized was very important in the art of warfare and it's also something that we need to understand is very important in cryptocurrency you see to be successful in crypto you are not always going to follow the plan that you come up with you're not always going to follow the exact trading strategy that you put together before the bull market came,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
xNrE2SqhECw,but it is very important that you prepare yourself for the bull market in some way shape or form a few of the ways that you may do that you may put together a system that helps you to trade more efficiently maybe you have a certain kind of log system where you where you log all of your trades and you note what happened when you succeeded and what happened when you failed so that you can learn maybe you are putting together some kind of tax reporting software for all of your trades that'll make it easier for tax time next year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
xNrE2SqhECw,maybe and this is what I really think is the most valuable you're investing in your education in cryptocurrency either by watching channels like my my own or by going through Club d5's principles of technical analysis maybe you're studying geopolitics maybe you're studying macroeconomic analysis maybe you're studying history maybe you're doing whatever it is to prepare for the bull market but I would encourage you to focus primarily on education you see summer is coming in Florida climatologically but it's also coming into cryptocurrency technically over the next six to 18 months there's a bull market coming my friends we're going to hit all-time high next year I believe it might even happen sooner but it'll probably happen in quarter two of next year and when that occurs Bitcoin is going to have already made most of the gains that it will make during the bull market we've already appreciated in price by over twelve thousand dollars from where we started at seventeen thousand dollars Bitcoin is likely going to push even farther to the upside in just the next few months as a result of CPI changes coming out April 12th,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
xNrE2SqhECw,and I think June 10th would be the next one or May 10th following that in June 10th following that my point is in the same way in Florida you like to prepare a little bit for the summer in my case I like to prepare a little bit for the winter because I prefer the cold weather in cryptocurrency you want to prepare and you want to plan for what you're going to do to maximize your profit in the coming bull market in the coming summer in cryptocurrency,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
xNrE2SqhECw,so my challenge my question to you is what are you doing right now to prepare yourself for the bull market that is coming my advice would be and this is advice my advice would be to heavily invest in your education I firmly believe that the best place that you can invest your education in is in the art of technical analysis and then add the on-chain the macroeconomic analysis and all of those things on top of that understand how to profitably trade and invest and then go and become successful in the cryptocurrency markets because I certainly believe you can if you guys haven't already make sure to check out club d5's principles of technical analysis our academies have helped teach over 5 000 people what it is to do technical analysis in the cryptocurrency space and you could be the very next one who's marching towards Financial sovereignty so check out club D5,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
xNrE2SqhECw,but that's not really the point of this video the point of this video is to challenge you what are you doing to prepare for the summer that is coming in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency when are you ready again your plan might be worthless but the planning that you do now will absolutely be indispensable pace,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

cq8DsOrfaiY,someday i mean that's the way i look at it i'm like one day it's all gonna be over and you've got those last five minutes to look back and see what did i do in this life bro did i work did i d did i get the most out of myself or am i gonna go into that dark night thinking i left a lot on the table i left something on the table and i think that is honestly it's it's kind of morbid but it's almost like a living for the moment before you die kind of thing not that you do,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cq8DsOrfaiY,but it's something that i think about i think about when i'm leaving this world what did i leave behind because i don't get to take any of it with you you're speaking to my heart man you're speaking to my heart jeb you really are um i am i often use the analogy of standing in the arena and and that at the end of the day that's where i want to be and that's where i've actually you know you know this for the last two decades of my life i've been standing in the arena blood on my face calloused hands cuts and bruises you know sweating profusely breathing hard looking up to the you know the sky and the lord of lords,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cq8DsOrfaiY,and i'm there like that's the imagery that i have of my life is that i'm literally in the middle of a sandy arena with blood and and guts and and calluses and bruises and staring at heaving heavily looking up to the sky and for me standing in the arena is where i want to be there's going to be thousands of people in the crowds from a ratio of you to millions in the crowds that are jeering and are saying you shouldn't have done it or you couldn't do it or you whatever so much color commentary bro you you can throw whatever color commentary you want at me because i'm the one in the arena i'm the one that tried i'm the one that that might have failed but at least i gave it my best shot and for me that imagery has led me in and powerfully in my life because we have to remember that first off none of their comments matter at the end of the day number two they're never really thinking about you they're only thinking about you when you think they're thinking about you um,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cq8DsOrfaiY,and so you if you if you see the world in that terms we're so socially inclined now right from twitter to instagram to you know tick tock you you feel like everyone's no one's watching you yeah because because they might have watched you but they just scrolled beyond past cares for 15 seconds so do you and do you big time stand me in the arena and appreciate the fact that you're one of the few that are willing to do it because most aren't yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
cq8DsOrfaiY,i think that's huge that's something that i see a lot of people doing that just makes me really sad because what you're doing when you're in that environment of worried about what other people think is that you're living for them and not for yourselves and that is where the disconnect is is when you're living to make everybody else happy when quite frankly they've got a lot of other they've got a lot else on their mind they're not thinking about you very much in the first place so if you fail they're probably gonna forget about it you're thinking about it a lot more than they are and even if they were thinking about it all the time what does it matter it comes down to an insecurity i think in people and uh i love that you mentioned the arena because uh would you know lindsey sterling the violinist by chance uh name sounds familiar yeah she she she um she's a dancing violinist and she has a song called the arena,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

Nj96VsBgqbU, Bitcoin is just days from a massive reversal hey guys what's going on Jim here and in today's video we're going to be launching a new series called up next and in this series I'm going to be showing you what the next month is looking like on the Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency markets and in today's video we're going to be analyzing what the next month for Bitcoin is going to look like because I'm really excited to share with you that I think the bottom for Bitcoin at least in this shorter term Market is coming within the next one to two weeks I'm going to be showing you exactly where that bottom is I'm going to show you what the next rally is likely to look like based on a plethora of different technical factors up next bitcoin's gonna bottom soon and then it's going to go through a rally at least that is the prediction that we're making today,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,so we're going to be breaking down exactly why that's our prediction how we got to that and what you can do with that if you're looking to trade that rally that's coming up next if you enjoyed today's video make sure to hit that like button subscribe to the channel without much further Ado let's go ahead and Dive Right on into it let's start with the question what's up next well to get to the bottom of the question what's next we first have to answer the question what happened Bitcoin has been in a major correction ever since it topped out at 31 000 on the 14th of April 2023.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,it's Fallen to date over five thousand dollars over the course of 40 days over 16 and a half percent during that correction Bitcoin has set a couple of very powerful lows first and foremost we bottomed out here around April the 22nd around twenty seven thousand dollars on top of the 50 daily exponential moving average that's one of the most important moving averages in cryptocurrency technical analysis from that first bottom Bitcoin would bounce all the way up to about thirty thousand dollars before rejecting again and going through its second leg of the bounce this time we dropped all the way down to the 100 daily exponential moving average bounced slightly and tested the 50 daily EMA as resistance and rejected from it from there Bitcoin has begun a correction and at the time of recording this video it has started to drop below the 100 daily exponential moving average which gives us a lot of insight as to where Bitcoin may be going next this correction has also been defined and predicted by Lux alga which as you can see gave us a red cell signal here on the 19th of April it was confirmed the very same day by the train catcher and it gave us a price Target between twenty five thousand eight hundred dollars and twenty three thousand dollars you can see denoted here in blue briefly hiding all of our drawings you can see that Bitcoin originally came down to the very top of this first take profit Zone on May the 12th 2023 and at the time of recording this on the 25th of May Bitcoin dropped all the way down there once again meaning that we're approaching the take profit Zone that this original sell signal from April 19th called for in other words Bitcoin seems to be very close to the bottom however it's not just Lux algo giving us this indication that we're close to the bottom because of that take profit it's also the 50 the 100 and the 200 daily EMA as you can see bitcoin's first correction we bottomed out at the 50.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,on the second correction we bottomed out on the 100 the third correction very well may bottom out down right around twenty five thousand dollars which is where the 200 daily exponential moving average sits that 200 Dema also resides in the very middle of the first take profit zone for the Lux algo sell signal and two more things it also converges with a very large big even that being 25 five thousand dollars of course that's a very impactful number for many Traders and investors because they see twenty five thousand dollars and they say that is a number that I am interested in trading around because twenty five thousand dollars comes to mind a lot quicker than twenty three thousand four hundred seventy two dollars and forty eight cents big evens are very important in the math psychology of crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,and you have to understand the mass psychology of crypto to understand where the market is going the second convergence with that 200 daily EMA is that the 500 billion dollar Mark for bitcoin's market capitalization sits just above 25k as you can see on coin market cap as Bitcoin trades at 26 200 it is also trading at 508 billion dollars dropping down to just above twenty five thousand dollars would mean that we are entering the take profit Zone as denoted by Lux algo it means that we're dropping down to the 200 daily EMA continuing our trend of finding support on the 50 to 100 then the 200 it would also indicate that we're falling down to support on a big even that being twenty five thousand dollars and fourth it means that we would be finding support on the 500 billion dollar market capitalization level for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in short it is highly likely although not guaranteed that bitcoin's final bottom for this correction that we started on April 14th will be somewhere in the range of 24 and a half to twenty five and a half thousand dollars we've already dropped down to twenty five eight it's possible now as the bottom I think we may have a little bit further to go but the point is with all likelihood that bottom is very very close so what's up next the reason I'm so excited about this series that we're launching here on the crypto Jeb YouTube channel is because to enter a trade it's much better to figure out what's up next and then enter into that trade as you're moving into that Trend that's coming up next it's much better to enter into a new trend rather than to try and catch a trend when it's already coming to its completion the downtrend that we've been in for the last two months is near its completion not the best time to enter ashore the better decision is to wait for what's next a rally that's likely coming in the next two to three weeks and then get a trade-in how does that look let's talk about that with the Bitcoin Market likely bottoming out above 25 000 in the next week or two that of course gives us the question what's next well of course there are two outcomes number one Bitcoin could go into a rally number two Bitcoin could go into a downtrend cue the hate comments,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,oh my gosh Jeff said it could go up or down well dollar can go up and down okay Bitcoin can always go up or down let me just back up and give you an analogy that I think was very helpful on coffee and crypto I live in the beautiful and warm and sunny state of La Florida I live in Florida and in Florida if you're a Floridian you know about hurricane season you know that every single year we get this season for three or four months where we're about to get slammed by a hurricane your job,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,and I'll explain why is to be like the meteorologist the governor the police force the school teacher the mayor and the citizen all at once let me explain your job as the meteorologist or in this case the technical analyst is to try and figure out with a certain percentage chance what city is that hurricane likely to strike is it going to hit Panama City is it going to hit Tallahassee is it going to hit Jacksonville is it going to hit Orlando Miami St Petersburg Fort Myers is it going to hit Gainesville is it going to hit Orlando where is that hurricane going and with what percentage likelihood that has to be updated daily because the Hurricane's moving and things are changing and it's not a direct science where you can just predict with absolute certainty where it's going to go but you have a general idea this cone as you've seen before that the Hurricane's going to go somewhere in this area and it's is likely going to go here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,so okay the meteorologist has done his job he says it's a 73 likelihood that is going to hit Jacksonville it's only a three percent likelihood that the hurricane is going to hit Panama City therefore this is a big hurricane it's a dangerous hurricane the vast majority of the planning and preparation that the governor the mayor the citizen school teacher the police force does should be done in Jacksonville because overwhelmingly likely according to the meteorologist that the hurricane is going to hit Jacksonville but if there's a three percent likelihood that the hurricane is going to hit Panama City it's still prudent to plan just in case this city this 300 miles west gets hit right because it's better to have a plan and not need it than to not have a plan and need it so if you're in cryptocurrency and you're a technical analyst your job number one is to be like a meteorologist they get a bad rap,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,But ultimately if you know A hurricane's coming you can think of meteorologist for that because you had time to plan your job is to be like a meteorologist and say there is a certain likelihood that the Market's going to go up it's going to go sideways it's going to go up to this price Target is going to go to this price Target or maybe it's going to go down the Hurricane's going to hit Jacksonville maybe I'll hit Panama City maybe he'll hit Tampa here's the likelihood of it hitting each City what I'm here to tell you today is that the likelihood is that Bitcoin is going to bounce above 25 000 and go through a few thousand dollar rally however there's a three percent chance the hurricane can hit Panama City,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,so I'm going to show you the short trade as well even though it's not what's most likely what's up next for Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is very likely to break bullish out of this descending wedge when it does so after bottoming out either where it's bottomed right now or slightly above 25 000 you're going to want to look for some confirmations first and foremost you can look for a confirmation of a breakout based on breaking above this downtrend second and second most you could wait for a confirmation of Lux algo giving you a Buy Signal with Trend catcher confirmation that would be another confirmation thirdly you could wait for Bitcoin to break above the 100 and above the 50 daily moving average that would give you another confirmation all of those confirmations would likely come into play sometime in the beginning of June maybe into mid-june around 26 to 27 000 after you breach through that zone and maybe after you break above let's say twenty seven thousand five hundred dollars that's where you might say okay if there's enough exuberance here I am confident to go ahead and and start preparing to enter a trade remember the hurricane is likely to hit Jacksonville the metaphorical Jacksonville is the long train it's less likely to hit Panama City than metaphorical short traits we're not going to spend as much time on the short trade we're gonna spend the majority of our time on a long trade because that's what's more likely to be necessary if Bitcoin breaks here above this downtrend we have Lux algo coming in green we have uh this level of 27 500 broken maybe we even see a Fed rate pause coming in as icing on the cake in June 14th meeting then that's where you may enter a long position as Bitcoin starts to come back to the upside around let's say 27 750.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,from there you're going to want to use a very conservative stop loss in this case we have a lot of sideways trading here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,so I'd say if Bitcoin fell below 267.50 you'd probably want to get out of that trade as far as price Target is concerned guys remember this is a pretty large descending wedge that Bitcoin finds itself in so the price Target could be pretty high in fact the price Target could be all the way up to 32 or 33 000 I would set your first exit here at probably 29 500 just so that you get an exit right before 30 in case we reject off of 30 000 then put some more exits up here towards Thirty one thousand dollars and maybe your last third you would exit right before we hit 33 which is that big even that we've been talking about for the last several months 32 935 those three exits on that long train might look something like this the first third of your position you would sell at 29.50 the second third you'd sell at thirty thousand seven fifty just in case we double top here at this previous High set on April 14th let's say you might exit that third third right there around 32 750.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,so there you go what's up next Bitcoin is likely to bottom out around twenty five thousand dollars maybe a little higher and it's likely to go through a five to seven thousand dollar rally up to between thirty thousand and thirty three thousand dollars if Bitcoin does that if it hits Jacksonville then I just gave you a potential trade setup but it's not just my dream to give you a fish I want you guys to learn how to set these trades up on your own so extract the principles out of what I just said and set up a trade for yourself you might think I don't think I want to put a take profit there I might want to put it here you might also want to wait for the take profit from Lux algo because those take profits are very powerful now as far as the short trades concerned what happens if we hit Panama City the contrarian view right now is that there is a gap down here on CME Futures between 20 421 one thousand dollars what happens if it goes all the way down here,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,Jeb well very simply let's talk about what happens if we hit Panama City I think is the less likely option but why not address it if Bitcoin therefore capitulates below the 200 daily EMA that's where you would start considering a drop down to twenty thousand dollars first off twenty thousand dollars a very strong level of support I doubt Bitcoin is going to brace that especially if we're only going down there to fellow CME Gap it's possible it's unlikely therefore I feel comfortable saying let's enter a short trade here around 24 750 based on what you know from the time this is the contrarian view so we need to have updated technical analysis that's saying no actually now this is the likely outcome see what I mean we want to wait and have a little bit more confirmation before we just enter the short just because we hit that price Target you can hit 24 750 and not enter a short if there's other corroborating factors that would lead you to believe that it's actually just bottoming a little lower than we originally thought so don't just enter the short because we hit that level don't set that as an automatic trade just wait and see if maybe Bitcoin is just sending a wick you don't want to enter a short when we're catching a falling night but if Bitcoin has actually gone into a major downtrend and there's confirmation I'm not gonna get into them today because again we're not gonna spend as much time planning for the least likely scenario,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,but if there's confirmation then sure you can enter this short trade take profit on this one guys to be honest with you we drop below 24.5 we're probably gonna go down to at least 21 500 so I'm gonna set an exit here at 21 650.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,the reason for that is that 21 500 has been a very important level of resistance in past we used it as resistance here we use it as resistance here and support here therefore I'm going to set the first stop right above that level because there's not a lot of vrvp support in this Zone you can see Bitcoin is kind of just going to fall straight down to it that'd be the first take profit maybe take half of your profit there the second take profit on the short trade would probably be setting a take profit right around twenty thousand five hundred dollars so there you go what's up next I'd give it an 80 likelihood we're gonna bottom around twenty five thousand dollars and go through a rally like I just defined we're gonna give that an 80 likelihood so therefore we spent the majority of our planning on that outcome on the flip side it is possible that Bitcoin capitulates and falls to the downside I mean give this a 20 likelihood Canon happen happen,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Nj96VsBgqbU,yes is it likely no if that occurs then I've given you a potential trade setup again not to just give you a fish but to teach you principles of how to fish I.E set these trades up for yourself I would love to hear if this is helpful I'm really excited about this series because ultimately that's what you guys are trying to get out of technical analysis you're trying to figure out what's up next how do I trade it tell me in the comments down below if that was helpful if you want to learn more about technical analysis and how to apply that technical analysis then I would highly encourage you to sign up for Club d5's principles of technical analysis we've got over 60 videos over in club D5 teaching you guys everything that you need to know about technical analysis so that you can hit the ground running making profitable trades in principles of technical analysis we're going to teach you everything from the very basics of technical analysis talking about what happens when a market continues in its current direction what happens when it reverses how do we confirm Trends then we're going to talk about all the different Candlestick formations all the different indicators we're going to talk about all the different principles such as psychology of candlesticks such as psychology of Traders and we're even going to be showing you how to use the different softwares that you'll use daily such as trading viewing coin market cap all of this and you're also going to be getting access to weekly office hours where I'm meet with you guys at 8 30 PM Eastern where I get to meet with you guys on a teacher student group setting and you guys can ask me all of your pressing questions those are recorded uploaded in our exclusive Discord server every single week so that you guys can see the review of that ask questions on that video and I'll answer them in next week's office hours which will also of course be recorded Club D5 is set up to walk you through this process of saying what's a chart to becoming a profitable Trader and analyst so that you guys can reach towards that goal of financial sovereignty also consider signing up for Lux algo you can use coupon code Jeb jebb 30 or 30 off at checkout with the link in the description box down below and save 472 on Lux algo over the first year by using the annual plan and coupon code combined hopefully you've seen how useful Lux algo is is absolutely a product that you want to get access to I've been using it every day for years I'm a very big fan of it I use it in almost all my videos make sure to check it out down below as far as the prompt no one responded to The Prompt last week with the wallet address so we're gonna do this again as you guys know we have this thing where I do a giveaway of half of last videos ad Revenue to whoever answers the prompt in a way that I find interesting so here's the question I'm gonna ask it again because I asked it last week and I'm really curious your answers for this what is your favorite building around the world is it the Taipei 101 is it the Burj Khalid what's your favorite building and why give me a good reason leave your wallet address,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

2JXLkXI5b1I, hey guys what's going on Jib here and in today's video we're going to be talking about a certain character trait that all successful investors in all successful traders in cryptocurrency hold and this doesn't just apply to cryptocurrency this applies to any kind of market this also applies to business and this also in general applies to your life so guys what we're talking about today's video is something that I'm sure you have heard a thousand times but I'm gonna tell you a thousand and one times because you need to hear it again and you need the refresher I see a lot of people in my comment section in need of a video like this so we're going to be talking about this in today's video but guys before we're getting today's video if you enjoyed today's video definitely cuz they're dropping like and hitting the subscribe button,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,so let's get right into it what are we talking about in today's video well in a word patience now do yourself a favor don't click off the video because you think you know what I'm about to say you will thank me at the end of the video this is something that so many people think they understand yet even if they do understand it they are not implementing it a lot of people you tell them you give them some kind of advice you say ok well this is what you need to do and you'll be successful in they say yeah ok I've heard that a thousand times yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,but hearing it and doing it are two separate things a lot of people need to be given advice not because they don't know that the advice is out there but because they haven't actually put it into effect yet a lot of you guys understand the concept of patience you understand how important the concept of patience is but you don't implement it there are so many people that look here on the our charter or trading down here on the five minutes shorter on the minute chart or you're trying to figure out some kind of charting software they'll give you access to a 30-second chart and so many people forget to zoom out get perspective and have a little bit of patience and see where the market is actually going and actually have a good understanding of what the market is doing and actually have a good idea of what they're going to do when the market does a certain thing guys patience is very very important,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,let's zoom out here from the hour chart out to the day chart I trade on the 4-hour in the day short a lot of guys a lot of people in cryptocurrency trade in the hour sharp maybe the 30-minute chart and there are a lot of people that make a lot of money doing that don't get me wrong you can make a lot of money doing that but those people also have patience there's a person in our discourse or name kavik shout out to kavik if he's watching this video he's made a ton of money and he's only pinning dripped over like a month this guy's scallops and Trey's like a like 50 times a day and he makes a bunch of money so there are definitely ways you can do this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,but he still has patience because he knows when to buy and sell the reason that I like to trade out here on the for hour and the day chart is because it's so much easier to actually have a little bit of patience step back have a level head and examine the market when you're not in a rush that's why I don't do day trading that's why I don't trade it in enter to intraday trading,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,"and that's why I don't try to trade these little candlesticks that we see down here in the 4-hour chart and that's why I didn't trade one of these breakouts that I was talking about here and a couple a couple of videos ago is because I like to be able to zoom out have a little bit of patience and look at the entire market so many people are so concerned about Bitcoin just mooning and going back to 20,000 by the end of the year I know that a lot of people are concerned about that because when I put that in the thumbnail or the title then a lot of people click on the video I have data to back this statement up a lot of you guys are very interested in what is happening in the market right now when is the bull run starting when is the next bull run coming and I am - don't get me wrong I'm interested in it",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,"but I'm not interested in it necessarily for making money I'm interested in it because I like spectating the market that's why I'm a commentator here in cryptocurrency because I find it interesting and because I know you guys find it interesting that's why I talk about it but as far as trading is concerned you guys need to be careful with getting so caught up in wins the next bull run when is the next time that the markets going to moon so that I can make an absolute fortune and say when's Lambo because guys we were absolutely completely totally spoiled back here in 2017 because Bitcoin ran from around 800 to 900 dollars at the beginning of the year and closed the year well it closed the year about 10,000 but it ran all the way to 20,000 in the year that was an incredible run up",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,"and I was a part of most of this run up and there were absolutely amazing gains especially after a day right here in the second half of November right about here is where you could see the market actually just explode with just absolutely just go into a bubble we saw this happen right here we ran from 8,000 to 20000 like a month and a half people were popping champagne having parties buying Lamborghinis and everybody thought that Bitcoin was going to keep going to the moon forever but in that exuberance a lot of people forgot to step including myself because I was new her into crypto back then I was I was a little more green than I am now a lot of people failed to step back realize when it this has to cool off there has to be a bear market in fact no III wasn't one of those I should correct myself I should give myself a little credit the first video on this channel you can go back and check was recorded when the market was right around here",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,"and I was saying that the market was overextended and that we needed a pullback and then a couple days later we kicked off this bull run from 8,000 to 20,000 and that was just absolutely insane and the whole time we were going up here I kept saying that the RSI was overextended the RSI is overextended the RSI is overextended as we can see right here and of course the pullback that I was calling for happened and it was a lot worse than it needed to be but guys I'm not that concerned about this pullback because I have patience and I have the ability to persevere through bear markets and that's why you guys need to be able to do as well a lot of people they see a six-month bear market and they freak out",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,and I understand a lot of people have lost a lot of money I'm not bashing you if you've lost a lot of money but what I am Telling You is that the average life expectancy for the entirety of humanity is around 70 years in the Western world in the developed world it's about 80 years most of you guys are probably not about 40,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,"I know my demographics my average audience age is around 30 so most of you guys have many many many decades left to live six months is actually a six month bear market wherever you portray 66% you should be looking at this as a blessing that's the way I look at this market I look at this as a blessing because I don't want to buy Bitcoin up here $20,000 I want to buy Bitcoin down here $6,000 when we're 2/3 the price so that I can make a lot more money when we do get the next bull run that's why I'm actually happy about this market that's why I'm happy that we've been cooling off for the last month and a half because I'm not looking to sell right now I'm buying long term positions now if you're a trader sure this kind of sucks but if you're a trader right now it's also a pretty good time because we're likely to see a little bit of a run-up here but if you're a long-term investor which you should have a long term investment portfolio even if you're a trader now is an amazing time to be buying and selling a good market investor and a good trader or happy when the market goes up and happy when the market goes down because when the market goes up they can sell their positions and when the market goes down then they can buy their positions and even if you don't have a position when the markets going up you can still short the market and call the bottom so you can act we still make money no matter which way the market is going so long as you have a good understanding of short selling there's a lot of money to be made in cryptocurrency guys I know I'm rambling a little bit but this is kind of just coming from the heart I'm trying to explain to you guys why so many people are so concerned about the short-term price action of the market they're worried what's happened in the last month of cryptocurrency when Bitcoin is a 10 year old asset that has ducked decades ahead of it decades and decades and decades ahead of it the last Bitcoin would be minded 21:40 this cryptocurrency was laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto to be a long term investment a long term asset a long term build up into the cryptocurrency that we believe it will become or if it will be replaced by another cryptocurrency than so be that but",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,even just because and I think I think will close with this a lot of people assume that just because you can make a lot of money in a short term with Bitcoin they assume that because you can make a lot of money really quickly with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies which you can you can do that I've laid out many times how even in the spare market you could have doubled your money in the span of a month if you bought if you bought down here six thousand dollars this was actually a pretty easy bottom to call and then you sold up here at 100% game you could have made a hundred x or like 90 X in the span of two weeks there's a lot of money you could be making in the bear market but a lot of people assume that just because the market is able or that you're able to make a lot more money in a cryptocurrency market than an actual stock market or a precious metal market or whatever or especially a forex market that Bitcoin and crypto is a short term investment people assume because you can make so much money that it's a short term investment no actually what cryptocurrency is is it's a very very lucrative long term investment that's the way you ought to be looking at it guys don't be investing for the next six months you're not an investor at that point you're a swing trader if you're gonna be investing which I do recommend that you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,I don't recommend you guys do much but I do recommend that you guys have a at lease and investing portfolio so that you guys will have something that you bought now and in ten years if anything that you buy now still even exists in ten years and is still even talked about in ten years it's going to be worth so much money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,you can retire it is ridiculous how much room there is left for this market to run and if you're going to make money doing that what you have to have is patience that is a key problem that so many people have not just in cryptocurrency not just in stock markets not just in forex markets not just in precious metal markets not just in business but in our civilization in our society in general so many people have such a problem with having patience because of how fast-paced our society moves now everyone wants to have the next big thing right now don't be like that a little bit of patience will go a long way every successful person on this planet every person who is an overnight success had ten years of building to become an overnight success no one becomes successful in a day unless you win the lottery,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,but I don't think you want to I don't think you're going to want to hitch your wagon to whether or not you're gonna hit the lottery you guys need to have patience so that you can actually have things in your life go the way you want that doesn't mean you don't work for things and that doesn't mean that you don't actively pursue the things that you want that doesn't mean that you don't put in as much work as you can to get the things that you want you have to do that but you also have to have a little bit of patience and let the things that just have to work themselves do that and markets are a good example of that you can control a business you can't necessarily control a market so to close if you guys want to be successful in cryptocurrency or in any kind of market in business basically anywhere that you're making money that you're not getting a salary or a wage you're going to need some patience you're going to need some diligence,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2JXLkXI5b1I,and you're going to need a work ethic that people actually comment on and people compliment you for if people are noticing your work ethic that means that you're close to where you need to be if people are commenting on how patient you are that means you're getting close to where you want to be that's gonna be it for this video guys we weren't really talking too much about markets we were more talking about the mindset around market so I want to start doing more videos about this because I am even more passionate about something like this then I am just about talking about cryptocurrency so if I meld the two things together I think I can continue to bring you guys some more heartfelt some more great cryptocurrency content or at least some of you guys say it's great some of you guys think I'm an idiot but you know you can't win them all oh well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gjyig2EVLL0,[Music] let's go ahead and jump on to some ethereum because ethereum is in a very different position than bitcoin is right now bitcoin is in danger of moving too far to the downside and ethereum is in danger of moving too far to the upside let's explain over the last let's see here 16 days ethereum is up 56 and that is a very good thing for anyone holding ethereum i am of the opinion that a large portion of this rally was in uh response and in anticipation i should say to the eip1559 launch which has now happened we've talked about over the last couple of days how eip1559 burning 70 of the new incoming supply of ethereum is basically a having event for ethereum which we've seen happen on bitcoin before whenever you see a having event happen on bitcoin we've seen three of them now you almost always go into a massive bull market that's a 50 reduction in supply increase on bitcoin here on ethereum we've just seen a 70 reduction in supply increase on ethereum i think that ethereum over the next couple of months if the rest of the market uh allows for it could be seeing a massive run back up to five thousand dollars in just the next few months i really could see ethereum going over 5k by the end of the year and i think that we're going to be at 3 000 here in the next couple of weeks maybe even the next week or so there's quite a bit that we need to talk about here on ethereum but a lot of it actually doesn't show up on the chart some of it actually shows up over here on etherscan ethereum.org has a little bit of a history of a theory i'm not going to go into all of this but you can see here that the london hard fork did go ahead and go through this morning at midnight utc which is over in london,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
gjyig2EVLL0,i believe it here in the eastern standard time it happened around nine o'clock this mor not nine o'clock this morning i think it happened i don't when exactly did it take place it was earlier this morning i think it was around five or six,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gjyig2EVLL0,a.m you guys can tell me in the chat and it's had an interesting impact on the ethereum price we've talked about how there's probably going to be a buy the rumor sell the news event we've seen over the last 12 hours a dip in ethereum now the ethereum the uh i don't have the number right in front of me but the eip1559 officially launched somewhere in here and pretty much as soon as it did we saw a pretty big dip on ethereum in fact depending on where you measure it from we've seen anywhere between a four and a seven percent correction on ethereum just in the last 12 hours so the question is what gives i thought ethereum was supposed to be very bullish because of eip1559 i thought a 70 drop in the supply increase of ethereum was supposed to be a great thing for the tokenomics of ethereum i thought that ethereum was supposed to explode from this news this has been the big news in the space for the last two weeks let's explain so there's something that occurs very often here in cryptocurrency and we're actually thinking about starting a new show to address just this topic where we will get very excited as crypto enthusiasts about a short-term news event,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gjyig2EVLL0,and then what happens is that the price moves and we're happy great and within a week we've forgotten about it and then sometimes we see a major fundamental development like el salvador adopting bitcoin happen and then we forget about it a lot of times we get so caught up on something the day it launches or the day that it's announced it's out of our mind a week later because bitcoin and cryptocurrency move so dang fast i mean even right now looking at ethereum ethereum is exploding over the last hour like literally right now over the last hour and nine minutes ethereum is up five percent it's moving on the minute chart on the minute chart as i'm speaking the last two minutes,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gjyig2EVLL0,it's up at 1.3 percent this is why i'm talking about cryptocurrency moves so quickly that oftentimes we forget things and it's really important that we make sure that uh two weeks ago is not ancient history because it's not there are things that have been happening on bitcoin and ethereum that are incredibly bullish and ethereum improvement proposal 1559 is a good example of that the price action is moving to the upside right now but whether it moves to the upside or not i want you to remember that eip1559 is a great thing for the long term if we put it this way if you guys have tim you've seen the star wars movies right i think greg greg insulted you ultimately yesterday yeah what did he say he literally was he said like every time we talk about star wars he's just like can we please not oh yeah he's like he hasn't seen a single movie and he also hates it so like if you're listening uh sorry but i'm not gonna watch this yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gjyig2EVLL0,so in the very first star wars there's the there's a the time where they're like trying to jump to hyperspace and han solo's like if we miss by .05 degrees and we jump into hyperspace we could end up in a star right because a very tiny change over the course of a long period of time or in that case a long distance in space very small change can make a very big difference that's exactly what we're seeing here in cryptocurrency we're seeing a lot of very small minute changes like el salvador adopting bitcoin or eip1559 coming out or uh amazon allegedly adopting bitcoin that came out as not true i think they're full of it i still think amazon's gonna be in bitcoin in the next two years or blockchain maybe uh we've seen tesla talking about it over the last year especially we've seen so many little miniature incremental changes and every single one of them was big and then it launched and everybody forgot about it you remember four months ago four five six months ago when michael saylor got 1200 industry executives in a room together,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gjyig2EVLL0,and they talked about bitcoin for two days we we forgot about that within a week that's a big freaking deal you know how many industry executives he got in that room that are from fortune 500 companies that now are thinking about bitcoin it takes a year or more to get a fortune 500 company to do anything we shouldn't be surprised that these major corporations are not in bitcoin anymore or excuse me are not in bitcoin yet they're coming we've seen these little shifts take place eip1559 is a good example sure we might not see massive price action on the short term or maybe we do but we can't forget the long term game here we are playing a long game and so many times we get caught up on what is our next move that we forget that there's an entire chess game ahead of us and if we set the pieces in the right place we're going to win even if we make the wrong move on the daily chart that's what we're seeing on ethereum and bitcoin right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gjyig2EVLL0,yes they might be a little bit bearish big ethereum not in the slightest ethereum is rattling like crazy right now bitcoin sure it might see a little bit of a correction but we got to keep in mind those fundamentals because if we forget about them it's going to be a problem,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gjyig2EVLL0,anyway i have another article over here from cointelegraph i want to read a bit of an excerpt from traders bullish on ethereum after hard fork on all coins ethereum dominated the conversation and bullish forecast for fresh price gains while the eth btc pair is headed for its third consecutive green weekly candlestick ethereum's token could reach new local highs in the coming months after its latest successful hard fork um nonetheless although all among all coins ethereum has exhibited excuse me notable strength of against bitcoin and its hard fork london referred to as eip1559 should catalyze performance further for the short term a chance to consolidate recent gains is on the card say trader i completely agree with that i think that's what we're probably going to see i'm expecting a short-term top to be happening tomorrow on ethereum coin desk contributor uh michael di uh michael van dyke told twitter followers wednesday i've heard that name before vendipope yeah oh yeah we talked about it yeah he's yeah yeah we've talked about him uh yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
gjyig2EVLL0,but i totally agree i think ethereum is in need of a topping out the same way we saw on bitcoin look guys the market's very bullish right now but i do think we need to see some consolidation and i think that that is ultimately a very healthy thing for ethereum so what happens next on ethereum here's the deal it's overextended it's rallied stupidly fast it's up 56 percent in under three weeks let nobody tell you that bitcoin and ethereum can't move quick because by god they can what i do need to be careful of uh is getting too excited on ethereum for eip 1559 even though it's a major thing and forgetting that technically speaking a market should top out right about now on ethereum and i'm not talking about today i'm talking about in the next few days we are seeing that uh ethereum's rsi sitting up at 70. it's very bullish we're seeing that there's a macd bullish there's bullishness on the macd we're seeing that lux algo has a very strong buy signal but just like we saw on bitcoin healthy correction is a good thing [Music] [Applause],overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

-1MlAXARobc,so if we take a look here we need to start we reach the top a bottom and then took off and once we broke through the top of there then it was really going up high well we have pretty much the same thing we have the bottom there and then we hit the top the bottom and now we've just been dragging along the bottom pretty much like we were doing here before it saw some massive gains for ethereum not only that but this altcoin chart this is a crypto total market cap excluding Bitcoin and we have these wedges forwarding forming here once price breaks out from there have some massive rallies we'll take a look at this we have broken out of that top sitting right above there likely setting up for the next massive rally those who have patience will be richly rewarded because the brutal truth here is it 80 are impatient and think only short term the other 20 is smart or know what's coming total market cap made a bullish cross back in March the last time this happened was May of 2019 now we did have that summer rally,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
-1MlAXARobc,but but for the most part it was actually until about October when we really saw the gains taking off so that was roughly about six months from that time period Well six months from March will put us roughly around September for a massive breakout in all coins and Bitcoin right now this is the line the resistance line once bitcoin price broke through there price rocketed upwards well we're still a bit below there but in the next two to three months that would be the time period for Bitcoin to start hitting that with a parabolic growth on the way so that's all for today's episode if you enjoyed it push that like button I'll catch you guys later have a good one love you peace if you don't think bitcoin's going to a million dollars a coin and then 10 million dollars a coin you're already a loser from now on you if you don't own Bitcoin you're a,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

zSTz8275_5s,so those are important levels to keep an eye out for for Bitcoin but as we speak Bitcoin is basically fighting for price between about twenty thousand dollars and twenty three two night right now though across the markets we're seeing levels of panic that have only been seen five other times since 1994 30 years has only seen this type of panic five other times and guess what every other time it was basically when the markets were at a low before a massive rally and soon you know what could cause that rally well the one thing that's been crashing the markets dxy going up all of a sudden breaking down to unheard of levels breaking down below covid-19 resistance levels support levels also breaking down below this macro uptrend line this could cause USD to drop significantly and just take a look at this chart what happens when usdt drops bitcoin price goes up so those are very very important things to consider now as for the moment the coin values days destroyed has been support for Bitcoin defended for two months straight the first proper test across from covid-19 in the 2019 lows also seen at the 2015 lows this could suggest that the bottom has been in solid accumulation for months at 16 000 as a matter of fact we're seeing the super Trend Buy Signal on the five day flashing a Buy Signal for the first time in over a year the last time this happened bitcoin price went up 239 percent that's like 2.4 x from where the price is just flashed a Buy Signal as a matter of fact if we take a look at this looking at the RSI cups when we had breakouts from these cups this basically began a new cycle for Bitcoin we had the teal and then the blue and then the purple and then the red and now we're on to the orange cup which could lead Bitcoin to some pretty spectacular territory as we have at a breakout from that RSI just recently but you know what happens before the big Bitcoin event the halfing that everybody talks about the Litecoin having it turns out Bitcoin Litecoin approaching the halfing in previous Cycles Litecoin led the Market's new uptrend this is due to Litecoin have things occurring less than one year before the Bitcoin having usually spells the end of the bear Market let's see what happens July 2023 by this summer Litecoin hacking will happen you can see Litecoin price takes up first then Bitcoin follows Litecoin first Bitcoin follows we see Litecoin ticking up first potentially Bitcoin soon to follow we have had a characteristic breakout with each previous Bitcoin Bull Run each time Bitcoin had a green candle which broke through the 81.6 FIB each time this occurred this was pretty much the definitive move before massive rallies that ensued for Bitcoin we just had this green candle break through the 81.6 FIB which was at twenty thousand three hundred dollars almost the same we could potentially see the same exact thing happening for Bitcoin if that doesn't convince you how about on a monthly time frame I love longer time frame charts because you can't fake them out they give you a lot more information than the short little daily or four hour charts but this Bitcoin monthly green candles and RSA oscillator trigger bull run the fourth time in history each time we've had a green candle here in the RSI oscillator which we can see when this basically flips down here well that has begun the beginning of each major Bull Run for Bitcoin we're having it happen right now this is the first monthly candle this is like getting in at the ground floor,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zSTz8275_5s,and I know it sounds like I'm selling you a multi-level marketing scheme but it's not trust me so that being said for those of you who are still skeptical uh this chart right here again another monthly chart this Bitcoin chart proves that to the world that the four-year cycle is still intact a breakout above the 10 monthly moving average for the 10ma on the monthly chart we confirm this once in for all in 2015 and also in 2019 a long bull market began after the signal this is a long term price signal right now it's roughly around twenty five thousand dollars would be would Bitcoin break above there we could have a massive rally ensue for Bitcoin so that's all for today's video if you did enjoy it push that like button I'll catch you guys later have a good one love you if you don't think bitcoin's going to a million dollars a coin and then 10 million dollars a coin you're already a loser [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eQgzpj8qauw,boom shakalaka each time Panic has been this significant it has led to massive gains for investors and why the total crypto market cap is likely headed back to previous all-time highs within 12 months stay tuned what's up everyone Radley from today's video we're taking a look at a lot of very interesting charts for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies including why the Panic we're seeing across the markets is likely leading to highs and why all of crypto will be back where we knew it in less than 12 months before we get into it guys make sure to like subscribe click the notification Bell come join us on Twitter at the crypto love push that like button now today fear at 45 down from the past couple days this happens as the overall Market down two and a half percent today Bitcoin at 27.62 ethereum of 1524 BNB at 290 xrp 38 cents cardano 33 cents Dogecoin 8 cents and polygon 94 cents now is this a surprise that the market has dropped no we were talking about this when this Parabola broke past day or two well we were talking about how the price was likely to come back now levels where it could come back twenty thousand dollars previous all-time high also the 200 daily moving average that's another level that Bitcoin could find so port on or if it comes all the way back to the top of this descending wedge right now roughly around 18 and a half thousand dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eQgzpj8qauw,and there's a lot of panic in the markets that's been the basically the theory for a long time not the theory but that's been what's going on for a long time contrary to what's been going on at the top when there was a lot of frothiness there's a lot of panic right now this level of panic has only been seen three other times since 2004 each of these times led to massive gains for investors will this time be different everybody thinks this time is different the most anticipated recession on the face of the planet Bitcoin recently just broke through the 200 day moving average previously it was a fake out a couple times on the way down,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eQgzpj8qauw,but if the momentum has shifted from downtrend to uptrend like I was mentioning earlier this 200-day moving average could become support for Bitcoin right now we have just about a cross of the 20 and 50 day weighted moving averages they failed to cross over in April while on the downtrend but the last time that they did uh crossover that was quite a significant Bull Run for Bitcoin and where we are right now the market has pretty much recovered to where we were roughly in April of last year almost a year ago the market has recovered in terms of the number of addresses holding one thousand to one million dollars in Bitcoin pretty good recovery there we're in the point of the market pre-halfing if you base this just on time alone where generally the bear trend is over and the rest is the accumulation phase before the massive bull phase so there are basically three parts to a market most of the people get in late bull when there's a lot of hype and then they have to ride out the bear market and then there's the accumulation phase which is just kind of slow growth and then eventually parabolic bull run but that stuff takes a little while to happen happens after the happening it's coming now if we take a look at this chart right here we've recently had an obv breakout right down here this blue line also very getting very very close to a Bitcoin breakout in the past whether it was a fake out or a breakout obv which is the unbalanced volume breakouts occurred a bit before Bitcoin once obv generally tends to be a leading indicator for Bitcoin the recent obv breakout could be announcing the most anticipated Bitcoin breakout of this bear Market as you can see each time we had a breakout in the obv previously that was basically right before Bitcoin took off now you can see here in 2015 there was a rejection for Bitcoin before a breakout and Bitcoin OV obv had a fake out and then back down before the real breakout could that be happening again certainly could but this interesting Bitcoin point and figure chart shows similar patterns to a bare reversal moment we can see previous bare reversal moments had nice price movement for Bitcoin afterwards looks like the same thing happening once again could be headed up for Bitcoin and if you don't believe that how about the RSI price action when we have parabolic growth to the RSI and a bottoming in bitcoin price what happens shortly afterwards very nice move for Bitcoin Southern buyers as the price goes up which brings us to this right now yields are going down USD is going down so yields are here and USD is right here and bitcoin's starting to go up now historically when yields go down Bitcoin goes up when dollar goes down Bitcoin goes up when yields and dollars go down Bitcoin goes up so as these continue to go down because Point likely going to continue to go up as a matter of fact just breaking out from this raising wedge on an inverted chart so this is truly a descending wedge but look at where price will likely go back to previous all-time highs that we saw for the total market cap and if you want to know when we can take a look here at the Bitcoin and Global liquidity Cycles represented by the Chinese 10-year every all-time high setting move began after the Chinese 10-year closed above its three week 20 moving average this occurred mid November already happened in each case the major impulse topped at most 12 months afterwards this was 11 months 12 months five months six months nine months the longest one was 12 months we had a breakout here where the Chinese tenure closed above the moving average so roughly 5 to 12 months we should be having another top which based on this at the very minimum could be previous all-time highs so that's all for today's episode if you enjoyed it push that like button,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

m6kai8pwPz0,Bull Run Easter 2019 Bull Run Easter of 2023 you fill in the blanks but every three to four years Bitcoin recovers from a heavy bear market and Easter has typically been a starting point for a run in the upcoming months or weeks not only Easter but also you have to figure the taxes due around the Sun this time of the year as well so that could contribute maybe people are done paying their taxes maybe they're getting their tax rebates maybe they're putting that into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies you know maybe people are pulling money out of the banks and putting that in Bitcoin all of these factors could add up to an absolutely massive run for Bitcoin right now we are just leaving the accumulation Zone below the 200 EMA once Bitcoin is above the 100 EMA confirmation that the Bull Run is starting so you can see historically when Bitcoin has broken this green line here the 100 EMA has been the beginning of the Bull Run we are right at those levels now should this diamond break to the upside it'll be the beginning of Bull Run territory we are just leaving the very end of accumulation territory so if you want to get Bitcoin at a discount this would likely be the last time and even better news this might not be one of those short little fuse mid-cycle parabolas and then bear market and all that stuff it turns out that back on March 11th Bitcoin plummeted to the midline of this envelope which is these three moving averages right here basically to continue a healthy price action there should be corrections to the middle of the envelope on the way up like we saw here back in 2016 many corrections to the middle of the envelope helped keep for a long healthy Bull Run however as we saw here in 2019 never cross back to that envelope had a nice parabolic formation a very strong price movement,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

1ZTn0sTooD4,and therefore you would have your money this is actually a very very very common thing in the world of high Network worth individuals the way that it works is a lot of our very wealthy families who we've been talking about for a number of years on this channel the way that it works is uh basically you would give different family offices a fragment of your your phrase or whatever the actual passcodes might be and you would actually if you want to in certain families you would divvy it up and that one son gets it one daughter gets it and then the other grandparent gets it so that at some point if you're trying to access 450 million dollars in this coin you would need three people in a room to be able to unlock it fairly fairly common when it comes to large amounts of money so that you simply don't have the sun walking into the family office saying I want half a billion dollars in Bitcoin and he completely runs away with it so when I first saw this I was like,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,oh this actually makes sense because this is how larger family wealth offices actually function and work so now they're bringing it to the masses if you will in that you would be able to do this as well uh with a ledger if you wanted to do so this is not mandatory you are not being forced to do this this is in no way shape or form going to change the money that you already have with Ledger the amount of people I saw talking about that they were going and I will not name names that they were going to be buying other Hardware storage wallets which have a history of being hacked into I lurk around on Twitter because I want to see what people are talking about what's the news what's the haps what's going on and when I once again when I saw that this was going on I thought people were joking I was like okay for those of you who don't know or don't remember I am a ledger affiliate I do not work for Ledger,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,but I have an affiliate code in the uh you know in uh the description box below and I receive emails from Ledger saying hey we have a new promotion coming up hey we have a new thing coming up and I read the email saw that this was coming out days ago,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,and I was like oh that actually sounds like a pretty cool thing I'll talk about it when they actually have it uh released and then when it was released everyone on crypto Twitter completely lost it because and I saw who the accounts were it's always the same understand when whenever you now say this nicely whenever you feel riled up whenever you feel angry at some news that you just got on on crypto Twitter on crypto Reddit uh trying to figure out who the original account was who made you feel that way there's a very common um theme of certain accounts taking information that would otherwise be completely normal and making sure that it ruins your day makes you angry makes you assume that something else is happening when actually something else is taking place there are a lot of there are a lot of YouTube channels who make sure that they terrify the ever-living crap out of you to make you believe that something is worse than it actually is this is a monthly service for those who want it some of you some of you already have your coins on coinbase some of you have your coins on binance some of you have a password that's securing your cryptocurrencies as password and and the year that you were born now I know someone's heart just skipped a beat,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,yes I'm talking about you the fact that they have an actual way to make sure if you want to and you are afraid of losing your seed phrase you could opt into this if you want to you are not being forced to and they would help you make sure if you wanted to that there would be other companies who would hold a fragment of your seed phrase and I saw people saying well that's crazy because what if what if information from those companies gets gets leaked and then what if voter what if both companies get leaked and all they need is is the is the second portion of of my phrase or the third portion and then they take all of my cryptocurrencies some of you click on phishing emails you know that everything you do on your phone is recorded you care about the craziest things that don't actually this this does not pertain to you if you do not plan on signing up for this service think about that I saw some people now I I I I get it I understand people being afraid or scared of things like that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,but the amount of people who were writing to me I mean angrily on Twitter that they couldn't wait to see how angry I was going to be or riled up I was going to be because because Ledger has completely lost it we need our freedom you know that everything you do on your phone everything you do on your computer is is is recorded and and given to other companies right you know that everything you do on Facebook everything you do everything you do on Instagram is sold to other companies I I I I don't understand how 99.99 of what you do is being stolen and used by other companies but the idea that there's one company who's like hey we actually have a secure way for you to you know secure your money and the way that you want to do so if you want an extra step of protection in case you actually happen to lose the passcode to all the money that you have on this device if you choose to do so and everyone's like no no no,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,no this this is this is the step that's going too far Ledger recover was announced on the 16th of May much the shock of customers thanks to a supposed turnaround on the company's so-called dedication to security the firmware update will give wallet users the option will give users the option to back up their seed phrase with three custodians a feature meant as a safeguard should any loser use their private keys if they choose to do so give them the option the hardware wallet maker clarified after heavy Community backlash that the seed phrase sent to the custodians is generated as an additional private key of sorts a Twitter thread was released explaining the mechanism although the post seemed to have raised more questions and answers nope they they answered everything I went on to Twitter and they yep for those of you not looking at the screen they made sure that there's a literal video that they put out explaining every single little bit of everything this is if you want it if you want to use this and listen,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,and I know someone just rolled their eyes why is TMI saying that over and over and over because I want to I I wanted to be explicitly clear that this will not affect you unless you want it to they went on to give deep information to explain everything that's going on foreign I feel like I don't have to read anymore I I think we've gotten to the point um I was quite disappointed once again uh in high figure crypto Community uh and I dare dare not even use the phrase leaders anymore who were coming out in opposition of this talking about they didn't understand why Ledger would be doing a thing like this how dare you try to uh fleece or scam the people who are using your product uh first of all um I would assume I I do not I'm not a worker for a ledger I do not work in their offices but I would assume that they have probably been working on this for a year when it comes to cryptocurrency companies and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,I I think Ledger is also a European company they have a a gigantic vetting process that makes sure that the companies who are actually going to be custodying anything that they are not only well known but they've been around for a while and they have all the proper safeguards,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,so I would even go as far to say they probably have been testing this for at least a year I would give them a good six months plus to make sure that there are constant safeguards before they decide as the largest Hardware wallet manufacturer that we have on this planet yes for those of you who didn't know Ledger is the largest one I assume that they went through a tough vetting process to make sure that the companies who they chose were actually good enough and have been making sure that they are safeguards so that these private Keys tied to you because if you if you're doing this you would have to use a form of ID which I saw a lot of people who were also confused about as well you know when you use coinbase and binance and Kraken and Gemini you've already given the government information that you already own crypto they know that it's you I told you that before when you are linking your PayPal account to your metamask when you when yeah remember last week when you linked your MasterCard and your visa to your metamask do you think the government just doesn't see all the information tied together that it's actually you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,as well I'm not understanding how logic works anymore maybe it's left the building I because I assume it's just not here anymore and therefore I would assume that and I would go out on a limb to say that this this thing that ledger has launched is probably extremely safe and even more so I you know I would assume that three parties having different fragments of a seed phrase is a lot better than you having it written on a piece of paper that's under your mattress that's in an old shoe in your closet that's inside of a drawer next to your socks no okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,and then also the fact that you are not forced to use this and a number of um High um profile uh cryptocurrency uh people came forward uh discussing how you know this is this is absolutely egregious what what am I missing someone someone I mean tell me because I've I've been reading uh since yesterday to make sure that I have all the information I've read through everything there is not one portion of this that is mandatory you can and I myself will I'll be completely honest with you I'm going to continue using my ledgers as I have already done so in the past I myself personally do not feel the need for their service but we've gone over that before as well there are many people in crypto who don't understand that they could or should my opinion be self-custodying so these people choose to use gemini or Kraken or coinbase because this is what they choose to do they have chosen in their lives to not self-custody so they have given their information to cryptocurrency exchanges because they wanted to do so you can,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,and I will continue using my ledger without using Ledger recover it doesn't seem necessary for you know the current portion of my life where I currently am so tons of people have announced that they're you know they're leaving Ledger and you know this is this is crazy I can't believe that they you're not being forced to do this stop acting like every single thing that's meant to actually or that could help you in some sort of way is bad and you want to know the most ironic part and then we're going to end the video here the most ironic part,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,and I and I hope that this does not happen to you but mathematically it is going to happen to someone the craziest part of all of this is a portion of the people who are actually complaining and screaming about this thing about Ledger on Twitter on Reddit online they're going to lose their seed phrase at some point mathematically we can assume that half of one percent of one of these people is going to lose their seed phrase and Ledger recover would have actually helped them in this case you understand what I'm saying so once again I hope that does not happen to you make sure you have your seed phrase in multiple places if you are able to do so as a literal backup however for those of you out there who are terrified of the idea of keeping your entire one Bitcoin uh on a ledger and you are afraid of losing your pass key Ledger recover is probably for you I've also said before don't feel roped in or reeled into anything if you feel in your heart of hearts that you cannot self-custody your whole Bitcoin your half of a Bitcoin the 15 ether that you have put them on a cryptocurrency exchange put them on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges put them on multiple ledgers I've told I have a lot of friends who are into crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1ZTn0sTooD4,I sincerely hope that you all got something from this video I hope that you all enjoy hope you all have a great day hope you all have a great morning afternoon evening wherever you are wherever you might be I sincerely do hope it's absolutely fantastic thank you all every single one of you for watching listening liking commenting and or supporting and I'm even gonna say thank you to everyone who left they dislike the moment they clicked on this video because you didn't hear what you wanted to hear you wanted to hear that ledger had done something egregious when all they've been trying to do is actually help you thank you all once again for watching listening liking commenting and or supporting and I will most certainly be talking to you all soon see you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU, hello everybody welcome back for another video hope you're all doing well and that you're all having a great day and without further Ado let's jump right into it california-based fintech firm Ripple has recently recently in the announced that its University blockchain Research initiative ubri since its Inception has supported more than 45 University Partnerships from across 20 different countries and funded over 1 000 research projects uh for those of you who missed out many years ago uh Ripple was more in the news as like an entrepreneurial helping people get things started up and also part of that was giving funding to companies and people who were willing to then also build things on top of the xrp blockchain that was like one of their main things even before the height of the idea of uh is the coin decentralized enough the company I think realized that they could not build every single project themselves so they began to give funding to other companies who said that they would then also be willing to build stuff on top of xrp and I think as far as the university Partnerships uh I now correct me if I'm wrong,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,but I think this is true I think a number of the uh nodes uh that Ripple had a lot of them uh were given to universities as a you know a a gesture of friendliness I don't know what you would even call it but it was more of a two in one to increase decentralization uh but also to like make sure that they were in like uh proper entities if you will like you know more reputable sources as uh anyway that's part of go away there we go bad news launched in June 2018 the University blockchain Research initiative aims to accelerate academic research technical development and innovation in the realm of blockchain cryptocurrency fintech and digital assets the initiative which initially committed more than 50 million dollars in funding provides financial and Technical Resources to research institutions and universities worldwide fostering the development of curricula okay collaborative industry research and the exploration of blockchain Technology applications,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,here's the tweet for it right here they're showing like students who are smiling so you know they're having a good time that's how photos always work since its launch ubri you ain't got no alibi has reportedly facilitated the introduction or expansion of up to 345 courses underlining its far-reaching impact the initiative began with 17 universities in 2018 and expanded rapidly adding 11 more universities in early 2019 including prestigious names such as Carnegie Mellon University the University of Kansas the National University the national oh okay I get it I had to read further the National University of Singapore I was like National in America and Cornell University as well what was the other Ah that's what it was for those of you who missed the news this was two or three years ago now there's no like there's no no news about this anymore even though it's still going on you can look it up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,I think it was Harvard Brown hmm it wasn't Yale maybe Boston University maybe and there was one other one uh people basically found out that these universities uh have like so for those of you who don't know University in America is expensive every you know got it uh but a large portion of that is that these universities uh from the student fees that they're making because it's a lot uh they actually are like these these wow these universities have like endowment funds where they take huge portions of that money that they got from the students and actually buy up land and like other apartments and stuff like that they say that it's for you know student housing so people have a cheaper place to live but you know wank another portion of these endowments people found out was that uh they're actually allocating huge amounts of money into Bitcoin and to ethereum you can find it type in like U.S University uh buying Bitcoin maybe it was 2018 2019,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,and when I say that it's no longer in the news it's because it's not so much that there was backlash so much as like I was backlashing because I was like you're charging people like 150k for four years of studies and you're you're using uh you know I'm I'm assumptioning and you you're using that money to buy Bitcoin there was also oh gosh what was it one of the universities got a donation of like I think it was like 50 million dollars worth of bitcoin and I was like did you did you just donate that to yourself to get into the news like who donates 50 million dollars to an institution that has billions of dollars if you've never there's so many layers of this look up how much land and uh what do you call it and and buildings and apartments and stuff like that the universities in America own you are going to be shocked because you would I would assume it would simply be like the surrounding buildings to have housing for the students no no no no no no no no no no no,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,no like when you talk about these uh uh these companies who are currently buying up all the real estate like all the hedge funds and stuff like that where do you think a lot of their funding is coming from you'd be shocked to really understand exactly a how much money there is floating around out there and how much of the things that we pay for services and or whatever is actually going into uh buying up stuff to make sure that we can never own it you'd be shookith I tell you anyway so cool uh Ripple is Rippling itself slowly back into the news every now and again it's not as much as two definitely not as much as 2017 2018 but it's cool to see that all the initiatives that they launched were trying to launch or actually doing something uh I haven't looked into it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,but I would love to know that people actually got something out of these university courses and hopefully they learned something and actually we'll be able to um uh do things with it as they you know go into their careers because if all this is just repressed that would kind of suck but I like to believe that there's some good in a lot of these things like what was that thing a couple of years ago it was Jay-Z and someone else they went back to their Hometown and I think they gave everyone I think they gave everyone like classes on crypto I think they even gave some of them crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,and and I think they also gave everyone like a laptop or something like that and there were people complaining like there you know they should have gave those kids more money you know they should have had better laptops and it's like he could have done none of that at all he could have stayed in his mansion in one of the five countries where he lives and simply you know he could have bought the school and kicked everyone out of it people you know anyway that's just my take on it that's the uh Ripple almost at Jay-Z news that's the Ripple Labs University blockchain Research initiative news news got a bit of track there but you know the channel and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,yeah let's move on also in the news the number of countries proving different types of Bitcoin Futures Trading contracts continues to increase because I think they're understanding exactly what's going on but alas here we are and the uke that is the UK is the latest example the London Stock Exchange group has tapped Global Futures options to start offering the nation's first regulated trading clearing in Bitcoin index Futures and options derivatives although the exact date of the product launch is not clear both parties expectations indicate that the product will see the light of day during the last quarter of the year they said the index future service will be called Cash settled through lch digital asset clear the latter will be a new segregated clearing service developed by the UK digital asset derivatives trading platform gfox sentences are way too long and approved by the financial conduct Authority,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,so this was fairly popular news I think any time that we get news about a a stock exchange or anything launching something new bitcoiny it ends up being popular regardless of what it actually is uh them launching new Bitcoin Futures I'm shocked that it took them this long to launch them uh Bitcoin Futures were popular years ago on two fronts uh one people within the cryptocurrency space believed that they would uh be something positive for the cryptocurrency market but we found out that countries actually only launched Bitcoin Futures uh because they were trying to lower the price of Bitcoin you can look look it up I spoke about this about 38 times already because it's one of my major annoyances in life and uh people assumed that institutions would actually be quite keen on um what do you call it uh buying up Bitcoin Futures uh but companies actually want to have exposure to bitcoin so many of these companies are actually buying up Bitcoin it's like I mentioned years ago why would you but if you know that there's a possibility that Bitcoin is going to go from 30 000 to 300 000.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,you know and and inflation is rampant why would you not so anyway cool so the London Stock Exchange by the end of this year will have Bitcoin Futures uh these will be traded in pounds and and you know in in paper money it will not be traded in Bitcoin it'll simply say Bitcoin Futures these people will try and uh bet against and or short the price of Bitcoin and they will be obliterated as has happened every other time before in the past so get ready oh this is that's very pretty there's a anyway that's the uh I was looking at there's a tree outside I have a cherry blossom and like it has blossomed more in the last couple of days okay all right let's move on in one of the most popular news stories in history The prominent micro blogging site Twitter has announced they're going to be rolling out new features that support stocks and crypto trading in collaboration with e Toro I think that's a European brand I don't know if if etoro is in the States you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
PingosQVCAU,I I don't know the new function will launch on the Twitter app on oh apparently it launched oh here we are according to a CNBC report users can trade stocks crypto and other assets directly via the social but it's basically happening on etoro okay Has anyone used this like does it work like are you on Twitter completely like like you know how like sometimes if you're on Instagram and you click on something like it'll take you to another website to like technically you're on Instagram like in the background but like you're actually on the other person's website is it is it that way are you or is it like a page that pops up on Twitter that says like Twitter Toro and that's where you trade your coins okay Tesla CEO Elon Musk acquire Twitter for far too much money 44 billion dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,and I told you it was going to go belly up a few months later musk claimed that the platform was worth only 50 of what he paid for it because I told you he overpaid and no one why were you trying to buy Twitter in the first place also recently he stated that owning Twitter is quite painful what what that's crazy who could have predicted that except for every other person an economist I'm not an economist if I was able to 44. do you know what you can do listen do you know what you can do with five million dollars five a million dollars in real estate gets you around six thousand dollars plus in rent per month I want you to have that in your head five million dollars you got a good thirty thousand hitting your pocket every single month at least at least from Rent It is believed that believed it only takes six million no six billion dollars with a B to end world hunger think of that 44 billion dollars on a platform that people were barely using in the first place I don't,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,I I assume owning Twitter is is quite painful and yeah currently Twitter has a cash tag feature that enables the trading views real-time trading data for index funds like the S&P500 and some stocks including Tesla users can search for the stock with that ticker symbol on Twitter by adding a dollar sign in front of it the app will oh I've seen that before okay I've seen it before the app will then display price information from Trading View using an API so yes one of the most popular news stories um I once again does this work I saw this news and no one is talking about it uh a couple of coins did of course pop up in price uh Dogecoin being one of them because you know the relation between Muskie and um and Dogecoin but I haven't heard a word about this I assumed that the popularity of the news would kind of continue on forever because everyone's uh so obsessed with Elon Musk and also apparently Twitter as well so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,I just you know uh and now once again because I assumed that this would would have taken a long time I expected by the end of this year and or next year that we would have a crypto trading or crypto payments on Twitter but I feel like this is me personally I would have heard more about this if this had actually been uh bigger or more used because you understand what I'm saying everyone was so hyped for this to happen and then apparently we now have Crypt apparently we now have crypto trading on Twitter and stock trading as well but it's not in the news anymore no one's talking about it and okay so that's the Twitter partnered with etoro and now people can trade their crypto and their stocks on Twitter do you have to go through AML or kyc or is it simply this is what I'm asking is it going through etoro because if you're signed into etoro and you use it on Twitter you're basically only using etoro like is there like a page on Twitter where you can no trade crypto or okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PingosQVCAU,I'll stop talking that's the Elon Musk is a genius I tell you he's an absolute genius he lost 22 billion dollars like no one else could and painful Twitter and now you can trade your Dogecoin through etoro on top of Twitter genius genius I would even say janius Twain makes a lot of sense okay let's move on radio I do hope that you've all enjoyed hope you all are having a great day morning afternoon evening wherever you are wherever you might be I hope it's absolutely fantastic thank you all once again for watching listening liking commenting and or supporting and I will most certainly be talking to all of you very very soon see you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PQzTBvoQ8lU,hello everybody welcome back for another video hope you're all doing well and having a great day this is another special video if you will this one is pretty much about if you can become a millionaire by investing in Cardno or a da the circulating supply of a da is currently twenty five point nine billion coins and the max supply will be forty five billion a da the current market cap is five point two billion US dollars and this entire video is based on a forecast that sometime in the future the crypto market could potentially one day be worth thirty to fifty trillion dollars I must also note I am NOT a professional financial advisor I am just a normal person talking into a microphone sitting in a room in my house please make sure to do your own research as much as possible on what you put your money into please do not throw money into cardano's simply because I made this video and moving forward let's start talking about some of the things that Cardinal has done thus far I'm not going to go too deep into everything that they have done it's more of a backdrop Cardno itself is not that old if you will it's only a couple of months olds not even a year old since the project has officially been launched but since then they have made a partnership with Seiran labs they have developed a partnership with Emmert ago which is a Japanese blockchain startup who has announced the integration of cardano's ad a coin into men apps plus the partnership with the Met apps plus a South Korean payment platform would involve integrating cordana into the metopes plus platform which is responsible for 10 million mobile offline transactions which is huge for a coin that has not been around for even a year yet in addition to this card ah no plans to spread ATMs all over Japan in 2018 there are a lot of other coins that have tried to do this and they have failed at the moment you can probably easily find a Bitcoin ATM depending on where you live but you would probably be hard-pressed to find an aetherium ATM ripple ATM or any other coin especially litecoin ATM so this is kind of if they do manage to pull this off this will have a huge impact on the price because Japan is a huge leader in the cryptocurrency world along with this they plan on launching a debit card something else that many other crypto projects have not been able to do at all many have tried many have failed simply because when people try to partner up with the bank the banks usually end up saying no because they do not want their names sullied by the use of cryptocurrencies or any type of integration with them so if Cardno manages to pull off a debit card in theory this should have a great effect on the price of the coin in addition to all of this Charles huskin team leader developer at Cardinal foundation also a co-founder of i/o HK on Twitter announced previously the signing of a Memorandum between Cardno and the Ethiopian Ministry of Science and Technology in a bid to promote the presence of blockchain technology in the country which means in essence they have partnered with Ethiopia to try and get a blockchain further along in not less developed countries but in countries that aren't as prominent when you talk about cryptocurrency spaces so this is also very significant when it comes to the price a lot of the crypto 3.0 coins one of the main things about them is that they claim that they will be able to be quick enough to handle worldly transactions on a daily basis at the moment in his peers that Cardno is able to handle 257 transactions per second which is not bad,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

PQzTBvoQ8lU,"oh no today at this current price you would get a total of 992 a DEA based on our there Cardona forecast a price increase is expected in the future with more adaptive card ah no the price forecast for the year 2023 on May 25th is 28 dollars and 35 cents with the five-year investment the revenue is expected to be around 27,000 percent increase which is insane in essence your $200 investments into Cardno may be worth twenty seven thousand nine hundred and sixty dollars by the year 2023 meaning if you put in essence in theory this is once again in a fantastic universe with the cryptocurrency market is worth 30 to 50 trillion dollars two thousand dollars into Cardno could potentially be worth more than a quarter of a million dollars which means roughly 7,000 to 8,000 dollars being put into Cardno would get you in the year 2023 based on these numbers 1 million dollars",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PQzTBvoQ8lU,I don't doubt it one of my major qualms with Cardno was that the project is relatively new but they have been making strides over the last couple of months tons of partnerships tons of things that are going on with the project it is expected that it will not complete the complete launch will not be done for another year year and a half to two years which is what's happening for a lot of other projects that are being released right now but if card on ou can do everything that they say that they can do or are capable of doing I do think me personally myself that this could actually be a little bit higher than is even on this website especially if Cardno adoption continues and I definitely think that it will as always this is not a joke please do your own research I say this multiple times in these videos because I hope that everyone does I feel like a lot of people don't I'm just a normal person like I said talking into a mic please make sure to research where you are putting your money into and see if you believe yourself in this project before you start dumping money into it,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
PQzTBvoQ8lU,alright everyone that is definitely going to do it for this video hope you guys enjoyed hope you guys are having a great day tell me if you plan on or have already invested in Cardno and what you think of the project thus far the highest price that we've ever gotten to for cardano's was around if I can yeah dollar and 28 cents so even at 20 cents right now it's still fairly believable that the price at some point will go up by 6 times if we have another major bull run again so if anything over the next year you may make six times as much as you put into it which is still probably better than you'll make from the stock market hope you guys all have a great day afternoon evening and I will talk to you all soon see you,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
2L3vvT4fHTM, hello everybody welcome back for another video hope you're all doing well and having a great day first up ripple has officially joined the hyper ledger blockchain consortium hyper ledger announced Wednesday that ripple is among 14 companies to join the group which first launched at the end of 2015 and to date has added more than 200 firms and organizations to its ranks also joining the group is the Cu ledger a separate consortium backed by a group of credit unions that last year formed an industry focus services company through a partnership with hyper alleged developers will be able to access inter ledger protocol ILP and Java for enterprise use the hyper ledger quilt project connects hyper ledger block chains with 1 ILP capable payment systems such as XRP ledger etherium bitcoin with lightning litecoin a mojo loop and ripple net helping us a deliver on our vision for an internet of value where money moves as information does today this is very good news for the ripple team next up in the same exact breath digital payments startup uphold announced Wednesday,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2L3vvT4fHTM,that it has added support for ripple XRP to their platform XRP joins uphold existing list of currencies and cryptocurrencies that can be bought or traded with Bitcoin aetherium and Bitcoin cash among others are ready on the menu so apparently there was a Twitter poll that went around where you were able to vote on I guess which coin they were going to add next XRP got 51% but this also follows what we spoke about a couple of weeks ago there is a yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2L3vvT4fHTM,his name is Greg Kidd he's a very wealthy rich I don't know how much money he has he gave apparently he joined part with uphold and part of the stipulation for him joining was for them to add XRP to their platform after he gave them a bit of a investment I was gonna send donation but is definitely an investment so apparently on uphold you are actually able to do a couple of things I thought it was just cryptocurrencies exert be XRP can be exchanged with no fees being charged and can be traded or used in transactions across up holes existing offerings according to statements these include seven crypto currencies and 23 fiat currencies on top of four precious metals very good news for XRP as well next up we finally have some news from funfair a lot of the projects have been very quiet lately but apparently funfair has finally or at least they have now updated part of their roadmap trying to talk about what exactly is going to be going on as they go further into the project they say that our next major step in the roadmap is to go live with our beta testing on maintenance they should have been in the early part of quarter two which is where we are now and we'll be announcing further information on how this testing will take place over the next few weeks across our various social channels based on the success of this test period will be we will be aiming to go live with our first operator by the close of quarter 2 that is around the June end of June give or take also within the next quarter we expect to announce our first third-party games developer and begin integration this will coincide with the release of more original funfair slots games and updates to existing offerings if you have not checked their website they have a an area we can pretty much check and see the things that they plan on launching they said that they're not finalized yet but they wanted to give people an idea of what type of platform and what type of games they were going to have through funfair throughout quarter 2 and beyond our team will continue to represent the company at a number of international events on the gaming calendar where the trips to g2e Asia and a disruptive online gaming conference in London among the numerous dates in the diary they also say that they are going to try their darkness so they will start giving more information on the project so exactly what's going on and it continued and quicker pace on discord and on telegram because people always like to have information about the projects that they are getting into last stop this is another very interesting one and I'll explain a bit after mainstream Financial Analysts might be fixated on Bitcoin so called death cross which apparently Bitcoin cross earlier I don't know if you guys have pretty sure a lot of you have been looking at other people's cryptocurrency videos a lot of people have been showing this thing on a graph that Bitcoin was going to cross or pass the death cross it was an indicator that there was gonna be a gigantic downtrend and the currency would fall down and they also fall down and there are people on CNBC talking about that the price would go to $1000 and people talking about it would go to 1500 so the CEO of abre his name is Bill Barr hit bar height believes that another rally is just around the corner bar height who once designed trading systems for Goldman Sachs how business insider that hedge funds and other institutions are beginning to see crypto assets as a huge opportunity and that all hell will break loose once they begin investing in the non-sentient markets I talked to hedge funds high net worth individuals even commodity speculators they look at the volatility in the crypto markets and they see this as a huge opportunity once that happens all hell will break loose II said once the floodgates are opened they're opened there are a lot of if you look at I know they're not that easy to find but I look at these things kind of all day if I have nothing to do I'm always into watching things about crypto there are a lot of really rich people and they say that the number one reason that they're actually into crypto is because of the volatility you would expect that they would be staying away because you know the prices go up and down these people know how to work the markets they have people who work for them who know how to work the markets and they're making a tremendous amount of money day trading and using BOTS to trade because of the volatility in the market you may think that people are losing money when when prices go down and they are not because they have people and BOTS like I said before who know exactly what they're doing and how to play the market so that they get money even as the market goes down he says the institution of interest is already starting to tick up in Japan which he said is a leading indicator of what will soon happen in the West regardless of retail interest which has seen a sharp decline in recent months there really is a zero large scale there really is ZERO large scale institution to money from the West and crypto right now this is already happening Japan once a large sizable chunk of Western institution and money starts to come in watch out this is probably going to happen once we get all the regulations in place Japan and South Korea and I may be one or two other places they know or have been told by their governments what these coins are what is this what is that their SEC has already jumped in and said what is going to be what it's pretty much down to Europe and the us who are pretty much saying that they will tell everybody sometime around June what all these things are not sure how many of you have been with me in this channel for a very long time this is what I was talking about before we there is no there's no rich money in the market yet everything that has kind of flown in has come from normal investors that's you and me and other people who are just trying to make an extra buck on the side once we have billionaires actually dumping their money into this this will not happen until they have proper framework for exactly what's going on like I've said before in other videos you will not have someone dump 500 million dollars into the market until they know exactly what they're going to have to pay in taxes because lord forbid should these people make any type of money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2L3vvT4fHTM,and then they don't exactly know what what's going on this is very big money is this not something to mess with if you have tons of money like this not to drag this on but hope you guys know exactly what I'm saying this is this guy's like the 7th 8th person to come forward saying something like this over the last four weeks I am big believer that these people knows more than we know about the markets and more they know more about what's going on like he says he rich people talk to other rich people they know exactly what's going on they know that the money sitting on the side kind of waiting I'm at this point kind of assuming we will see a large uptick sometime around June like I said before a lot of these people keep saying that it's going to happen in May and that exactly sure what's going to happen to me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
2L3vvT4fHTM,but we will all see together with our fingers crossed exactly what's going to happen with the market all right everyone that is definitely going to do it for this video I hope you guys enjoyed hope you guys are having a great day afternoon morning evening whatever you might be thank you once again for watching yeah I will talk to you all soon see you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E, a real Moment of Truth right now happening on the Bitcoin daily chart same type of deal happening on the weekly chart on cardano as I do this video two hours left of the weekly candle I want to break down everything going on with Bitcoin and cardano charts but I want to start everybody just you all know I'm very bullish on bitcoin and cardano and I could be wrong about it all I just want to put that right out there right at the start of this video but I am extremely confident that when you look at the entire crypto ecosystem Bitcoin and cardano and not necessarily just BTC price and Ada price Bitcoin and cardano ecosystems and what is happening on the ecosystems there's no better opportunity right now going into this next cycle I think it is the place to be it is the place to build and this is what I'm focused on right now I tweeted earlier I said a lot of people see the price of Bitcoin and cardano trading sideways,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
f23uEgU_O8E,and they think nothing's happening if they could just take a few minutes to look into everything launching Within These ecosystems they discover the highest amount of opportunity in all of crypto and this is something I'm going to continue just to kind of hone in on as we do Bitcoin videos cardano videos what are these things right so we're definitely going to do that just to give you a little taste of that for Bitcoin and then we're going to hop into the charts and then pivot to cardano to give you a taste and I alluded to this in yesterday's video bitcoin's most vocal skeptic he's talking about Peter Schiff who has spent the last decade trying to convince bitcoiners that Bitcoin is worthless just came out as Mega bullish on ordinals soon Peter Schiff will be using Bitcoin as a currency to buy and sell inscriptions so and this you can just see this person said so it's value to put your gold inscriptions on bitcoin but Bitcoin itself is not valuable and Peter Schiff said correct so Peter Schiff still I mean he's doing it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E,but I still think he's not catching on to the fact that he's actually indirectly getting into Bitcoin right so obviously needing to use BTC as currency to do what he's doing because that is what he's doing launching ordinals on bitcoin so that's just one little piece of it everybody there's so much happening with Bitcoin nfts and brc20 tokens and and the thing about the brc20 tokens and I need to do a video on this these are like free myths that are being that are being sent out to people it's incredible opportunity and it's just the beginning we're not even in a bull market right now so let's start let's talk about the charts and then we'll we'll pivot from Bitcoin to cardano hit the Subscribe and like I really appreciate your support this is Bitcoin on the weekly one thing to note before we really dive into the short-term move that is actually happening right now as I'm recording this video we we did a video about a brick wall for Bitcoin Bitcoin is face to face with that brick wall right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
f23uEgU_O8E,but before we do it's the weekly if you look at this weekly chart look at this and we we still have two hours left right around two hours of the weekly candle but look at the 200 week moving average Bitcoin seeing support and even seeing support at the 20 week moving average in green it's a really good deal it's a really big deal will it hold at that support level I think when we look at things like the daily and what this move that's happening right now I think that's going to help give us a hint of what to anticipate in this next week what's interesting is this is lining up from a timing effective which as we talked about China retail trading June 1st happening that's a big deal the debt ceiling uh deal that was just reached right going into this week what what are what are markets going to do this could be the breakout moment for Bitcoin quick look at this clip from the other day for Bitcoin check it,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
f23uEgU_O8E,and maybe this could turn into a busted triangle meaning bearish break but a false break to the downside doesn't hit the target of 24 and actually breaks right back up and through to the upside to we like those we like those busted patterns and this is what's in play right now it's happening right now as I do this video you can just see Bitcoin as we were talking about the break to the downside didn't hit the target pulling back into the apex of the symmetrical triangle it's at the brick wall because I I think in the thumbnail of that video I said be careful be careful because we have resistance here it's a 50-day moving average and it's a lower high Fibonacci we have to evaluate how Bitcoin interacts with that area and interestingly enough it's happening as I do the video so it's that last uh swing high at the upper trend line of Bitcoin to the swing low,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E,and you can see this green this green rectangle very confident with the 50-day moving average you can see the 618 and the 50 day right around 28 200 just above where Bitcoin is and the 786 up here around 20 29 000,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E,we can call it so Bitcoin is there now it's at the Apex it's nice to see Bitcoins getting gotten above the 20 day but we're at this in incredible confluent area of resistance this lower high red rectangle the upper trend line of the triangle itself of the pattern that we're looking at and the 50-day moving average on the short term this is what I'm watching for Bitcoin interestingly enough it's happening within this two hour time frame of the weekly close that we just looked at I think I'm pretty confident Bitcoin will close above the 200 week moving average that's a big deal that's all the way down there at 26 200 unless Bitcoin just crashes while I'm uploading this video let's hope not but on the short term I'm very much watching to see how Bitcoin interacts with this uh symmetrical triangle from where Bitcoin is right now break out to the upside just below 32 000 not an overnight thing because to the upside if Bitcoin does manage we need to anticipate the Throwbacks just as we anticipate pullbacks Throwbacks could happen where we're testing support for continuation to Target although at the end of the day,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
f23uEgU_O8E,you and I we would really enjoy just seeing a nice stress-free travel right to the Target itself but that doesn't always happen but that's what I'm watching right now in the short term that's Bitcoin resistance but at the end of the day everybody you zoom out on a Bitcoin chart and it's just kind of like we were we're so on track from a cycle perspective and what's happening in Bitcoin ecosystem right now going into the next having absolute insane opportunity it's happening whether Bitcoin price is sideways or even down that ecosystem is exploding with opportunity and then I I just pivot to the to the other thing it's that and it's it's cardano and cardano is the same thing right now I tweeted earlier cardano is electric right now and I want to just highlight a tweet that somebody commented for for kind of the sake of this video they said it only went up one cent again cardano price could be sideways for months,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
f23uEgU_O8E,but what's happening right now on cardano opportunity all over the place and it it only takes a little bit of digging into some due diligence into the cardano ecosystem you know I mentioned tap tools a lot check this out it's broken right now as I do this video tap tools is under maintenance I'll refresh maybe it's it's back up there we go that's good to see so it was just down though because what's happening on cardano ecosystem uh there's there's a new meme coin many of you might be aware of that has launched uh along with another recent meme coin and others and just defy in general D5 projects exploding so again it's not just ate a price it's not just cardano and I'm so bullish on cardano Native price I really am,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
f23uEgU_O8E,but it's what's happening on the ecosystem and the opportunity in the alt coins that are launching on cardano it's insane right now everybody and uh we have just this great comment this ecosystem has been alive and well for quite some time now but things are just starting to heat up for cardano at just the right time and that's what it's all about congratulations to all you early birds out there feasting on this incredible opportunity so I want to I want to just say this from my perspective and I could be wrong again about this we've been talking about this opportunity everything that's happening right now in terms of cardano D5 coming online all these all coin opportunities all this opportunity we've been saying it for years and it's happening right now and we're not even in the bull market right now I think there's still a ton of time to get into this to research to be very careful because this is so high risk but I think there's still a ton of time right,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
f23uEgU_O8E,and so I think it's good to take a deep breath slow down a little bit come up with a plan of action and attack it now let's pivot over to cardano this is cardano on the weekly let's real quick set some context for this this video from this is a this is a video from the other day we still have two days five hours left I'd be curious to see if if cardano could kind of get any type of move to the 20-week moving average it's not far this is a weekly chart but that area at that green line is right around 37 and a half cents,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E,it's like a 37.5 cents for that 20 week moving average we got an hour 52 minutes left as I do this video to see can cardano close and it's great to see this this candle getting back above the 20-week moving average everybody we've been waiting for this because we've been all year tracking the resistance at that area and if I just zoom out this has been the story of the bear Market that 20-week moving average we're seeing the Bulls stepping in this is the convergence of the 50-day moving out or the 50-week moving average a 20-week moving average the Bulls stepping in to shift this ship around that's what's happening this is the picture of it that's what we've been waiting for so there's a lot of patience here this is a weekly this is multi-month view right just in this very just sideways type of trading environment but this is the type of stuff we look for the 20-week moving average being below Ada price and so right now we'll be I'll be watching this in the short term over the next couple of hours just to see if Ada closes below and then in the upcoming week can we get the separation away from it that is always the key and in that Journey we have the 50-week moving average right around just below 40 cents so now let's dig into Ada on the short term because this is what I'm watching for couple things one thing for long-term context we still have this falling wedge that we've been tracking for quite a long time now breaking out of the upside just coming back down and just eight is just consolidating in its own way in its own roller coaster type of way since then but the target Remains the Same to the upside 70 cents what I find interesting right now happening on the short term charts for Ada and I'm not saying 70 cents is coming quick,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E,but it's in play for this current Ada move uh to the upside from this swing low in January but or December but what I'm really interested in right now is what we've been discussing on this Ada chart if you remember previous videos remember we were looking at this this kind of Dropout drop off into the bear Market low we had this very similar kind of structure of consolidation uh from basically just right here to down right so basically we're looking at this move very similar consolidation from a swing High boom so swing High boom and we were looking for Ada to do the opposite of this which is fall and to actually pop to the upside well that move is happening right now so if I actually take this entire move the swing High to that bear Market low this is when we put it over here this is exactly what I was discussing this is what we didn't want to see happen,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E,and it's not perfect but you can just see consolidation sideways the fall we want to see if Ada was going to to diverge away from that entire move and it actually has which is actually pretty cool to see on this short term chart and right now what we have happening on the short term and I think this is probably most important to me is just while we're watching how the weekly candle closes we have this 50-day moving average right here uh for Ada the reason why that's so important is just because we've had the convergence of all these moving averages you see the 20 day the 50-day in blue all converging kind of just coming together,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E,and now we really want to see an explosive move for Ada above these moving averages to kind of start trading higher highs and higher lows above the moving averages right now the 50-day moving average right around 39 cents Ada is there so kind of in a similar fashion Bitcoin on its own daily that we just looked at is at the 50-day moving average in blue interestingly enough Ada is about to test the same type of thing so they're both kind of contending with this resistance on the short term right so I don't want to sound overly bullish on bitcoin and cardano that there's been this massive breakout confirmed because that's really not what has been confirmed just yet we're actually still testing resistance that we've been watching,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E,but it is a good sign to see something like the Ada weekly above the 20-week moving average it's a good sign to see on the shorter term eight is starting to diverge from this this consolidation to the downside and the one thing I didn't even bring up is just you know you go to a Bitcoin chart for instance you look at the daily look at the momentum oscillator on the Bitcoin daily look at this this macd that we've been talking about Mac d-line Crossing that signal line go over to uh cardano on the weekly chart even go here check this out the stock RSI quicker moving momentum oscillator a little bit of a move to the upside so much room to the upside on the RSI the slower moving momentum oscillator as it kind of pivots this higher uh higher or I'm sorry yeah higher low that uh cardano is putting in right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
f23uEgU_O8E,so boom higher low high or low to the upside there's ton of room to the upside on the slower moving momentum oscillator so when we talk about a 70 Target that could be the move for Ada uh right now that is again this is a weekly chart this is a multi-week thing I'm not saying this is something happening overnight but again at the end of the day even if we just this all fails Bitcoin falls cardano falls when I zoom out on these charts I see so much cushion to the downside if it's going to crash and at the end of the day I see these two ecosystems absolutely delivering in terms of innovation and setting up for this next bull market and this is just the way that I see things this is this is what I'm tracking this is what I'm excited about I'm bullish on it's a it's a journey of patience to kind of wait through it as as we allow these things to really mature and to kind of come to fruition,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
f23uEgU_O8E,but I'm seeing these things and I'm getting I'm getting very excited for that next bull market when it does get here let me know your thoughts on all this everybody I appreciate you cruising through I really do excited to start this week and see what Bitcoin does cardano does hit the Subscribe if you're not a subscriber hit that like button I'll see in the next video God bless,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PcA0mjL_oVg, big news coming out of China all the while Bitcoin a big week next week on the Bitcoin charts all the kind of coming together to create an interesting Dynamic an interesting narrative this is what we have going on Beijing releases white paper for web 3 Innovation and development and CZ over binance tweeting as well interesting timing on this web 3 white paper from Beijing government Tech committee with the June 1st anticipation in Hong Kong so what's this June first deal you might have seen it you might have not seen it but basically Hong Kong Securities and Futures commission released a new rulebook for the crypto industry last week stating that retail investors can start trading crypto from June 1st China is back on board China's back on board this is huge for the crypto space and we see China the fear coming out of China sometimes,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PcA0mjL_oVg,and then we see the bullishness coming out of China sometimes that bullishness leading into kind of bullish environments on the crypto charts so start trading starts for crypto June 1st when a new licensing regime for crypto platforms begin so kind of what CZ said and what do you think in the comments below let me know but interesting timing with this web 3 white paper and you can also see CZ also tweeting a few days ago the CCTV just broadcasted crypto that was a big deal,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PcA0mjL_oVg,right so all of these things and he's saying historically coverage is like these led to bull runs interestingly enough and I can't agree more with this and then we're going to Pivot over to those Bitcoin charts this was the wolf of all streets on Twitter he said China is back puts his tin hat on I guess they saw the US stupidly cracking down on crypto and made the obvious decision to go the other way that just that has to be what it is it has to be that the I I don't even know how to word it but the lack of leadership in this country is unbelievable these are the headlines coming out of the U.S Elizabeth Warren is building an anti-crypto army beating serious U.S Bitcoin ban warnings we've seen just all of the Innovation beginning to start leaving the U.S out of fear because there's absolutely no regular regulatory Clarity in terms of how to build here and so it is so so interesting to see while this is happening in the US all of a sudden China going bullish on crypto and it makes sense it's it's a strategic play this is from a cycle perspective this is something that we see anyway,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PcA0mjL_oVg,but right now the timing seems perfect we're trying to do to do something like this so how will that play into the cycles of Bitcoin how would that play into the charts well we know the Bitcoin having is approaching right this is 2024 Bitcoin having and historically as you all know if you've been tracking any type of Bitcoin charts historically you know when we start approaching these havings something special gets ready to happen right so we're approaching to having China is starting to get on board here and then there are so many different data points in terms of this Bitcoin chart that could prove to be probably mostly bullish in the long term but in the short term to midterm there's definitely data that suggests we could go down I just want to say that before we talk talk about how next week could actually be extremely bullish the start of something really bullish because I don't I wouldn't say I necessarily agree with this there like I said is a lot of data suggesting there could be consolidation to the downside before the Bull Run really starts,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
PcA0mjL_oVg,but I did find this tweet interesting uh Bitcoin weekly one year of accumulation ends next week uh and and he's saying in my opinion expect first leg of expansion takes us to all-time high swiftly so this chart just right off the bat I want to say I don't agree with this but this chart is a picture of something I do wonder about on the Bitcoin charts and he's obviously he's looking at an accumulation schematic um and you can just see it's been kind of a year of consolidation which is something that is very evident on this chart we have kind of been in this year-long just channel of consolidation with the bear Market low right there the thing that I find interesting about that is we do have this this bullish news coming out of China that starts on June 1st right and what I've been really tracking on this chart isn't so much the Bull Run starting and we're you know going to all-time high quickly that's not what I'm looking at,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
PcA0mjL_oVg,but I am looking to see if Bitcoin started to diverge to the upside here after this consolidation that it's gotten to these moving averages because like I said there's a lot of data that suggests it could actually continue to downside in a very similar way that it did back here in 2019 That Swing High out of the bear market and then just consolidation right even to the 50-week moving average consolidation here to the 50-week moving average we even have data points like the sdh which is short-term holder Market value to realize value and that basically measures the value of coins moved by short-term holders compared to those coins value as a portion of the overall Bitcoin market cap so if you look at this chart of of that indicator you see in green right here how we're trending kind of back down as we got this pop out of the bear market now it's starting to Trend back down potentially below that red line into the red well if we look back at this if you can see the arrow on my screen the exit out of this bear Market back in 2018 into 2019 That Swing High Bitcoin on this chart with this indicator did a very similar thing it just dipped kind of down into that red right before the true bull market began and that's just something that I think is in play something to consider but when I start seeing and I'm sure this won't be the only post that I see in relation to a bullish scenario right now for Bitcoin to enter some type of Bull Run I really think now when you start having charts and indicators uh like this schematic this accumulation schematic that he has here pairing up with the China news and there's going to be a lot of videos that are probably in tweets and all these different indicators that are suggesting some type of early bull run,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
PcA0mjL_oVg,right so whether that happens or not the thing that I am interested in though is can Bitcoin especially going into a June 1st type of scenario with all this China news even can Bitcoin actually start diverging back to the upside if that happened if you scroll back because it doesn't have to be just completely compared to 2019 I know these Cycles don't repeat perfectly I just think the data is very similar and it really does help as a guide but you go back here we exited the bear market right got a consolidation didn't hit the 50-week moving average and it actually did continue just kind of cruising up into the Bitcoin having right so that was that cycle before in uh 2015 into 16.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
PcA0mjL_oVg,so we don't necessarily have to fall like we did in 2019 before the having maybe Bitcoin does actually start kind of cruising to the upside going into having could be very very telling to see next week what Bitcoin actually does so this is kind of what's happening today on my Saturday what I'm tracking what I'm watching I wanted to throw it out there wanted to hear what you all think let me know please hit that subscribe if you're not a subscriber hit that like button your support it really does mean so much to me I really do appreciate all of you have an awesome weekend and God bless,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU, welcome welcome to crypto Capital Venture there is there is a Bitcoin season coming we're always in some type of season but there's there's a new change of season coming and there's a lot of different factors that play into it this is kind of repetitive to previous Cycles but a little bit different at the same time a little bit special at the same time so thanks for joining the live stream everybody let's just jump right into this this is Will Clemente over here saying two major 2024 presidential candidates and this is this is one main topic that plays into this next Bitcoin season and I just wanna I wanna hang out and talk about this two major 2024 presidential candidates are both publicly pro-bitcoin Pro Bitcoin having a bitcoiner as a United States president is inevitable so that's kind of the first thing I want to discuss I'm going to pop up the chat just so that I can see it on the screen in case nobody can hear me but we're gonna get to the Ron DeSantis piece in in just a moment,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,but there is so much going on and there's a lot of hype about this right now right there's Caitlyn long game on add Ron DeSantis to Growing list of Challenger US presidential candidates in both political parties who are unbashedly pro Bitcoin and pro Financial Freedom I think biologies is right this General topic is going to be hot in the 2024 U.S election many ways to frame it so we're going to dig into kind of this next season this next bull market the things that play into this and actually we're going to look at this article bitcoin's next rally will get a jump start from three things and what we're going to discuss in terms of the political side of things is not even on here so there is so much revving up for this next cycle that I think is important to go over,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,and I do not know if you saw this or or not yesterday but Chinese State media removes video on crypto after binance CEO calls it a big deal although China has maintained a hostile stance against crypto the recent developments in Hong Kong have many speculating about its impact on China I don't know how long I don't know how long you all have been in these Bitcoin Cycles or through these crypto cryptocycles China narratives are always just this ongoing thing,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,it just if there's not some type of pivot from bullish to bearish narrative with China as it relates to bitcoin something's wrong there's always this bullish to bearish Pivot in terms of China and so here's the pivot it's been bearish and it's so interesting to me by the way three just over 300 days until the next Bitcoin having this is playing into that right the charts play into what we're discussing this white line here is the Bitcoin having pivots and narrative and all of these things going into the next cycle while the Bitcoin having this is something that happens every cycle this is my point so this is a big deal this pivot narrative China State Affiliated Media Company CCV CCTV aired a video about cryptocurrency on May 24th that garnered a lot of attention on crypto Twitter binance CEO CZ called it a big deal and claimed that historical coverages like these led to bull runs so I don't know if many of you saw this but I I think he's completely on point he says CCTV just broadcasted crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,it's a big deal the chinese-speaking communities are buzzing historically coverages like these led to bull runs not saying past predicts the future and not Financial advice but it really is so far everybody when it comes to crypto Cycles when it comes to bitcoin Cycles the past does not predict the future but it has been so repetitive up until now and all of these things tying into it so let's discuss these three things on top of other things that are playing into it let's discuss the Ron DeSantis piece to this story and I really if you're in the chats or if you're replaying this video I really would like your thoughts you know I'm a TA guy I cover technical analysis on the channel almost every day going to continue doing so I so I so am ready to change things up a little bit and this will this will take some momentum this will take some work for me to do this because this isn't a live stream YouTube channel last bull market and maybe previous to less bull market it kind of was,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,and I enjoy it I want to get into that that Vibe it's going to take some work to kind of get that momentum but in the comments if you could just let me know do you do you enjoy the live stream coverage if I could do like a daily live stream type of thing and then what time works for you I'm thinking 11 Eastern right around there would be the time that I want to do these I really just want to start having just I want to have some fun on this YouTube channel and if we're looking at even a Bitcoin cycle chart I made a pivot from my content we we survived the last bear Market I made a pivot in terms of my content and what I'm covering still doing technical analysis but I would say somewhere around here in 2019 it's very similar to where we are now and so I'm going to make a pivot in terms of spicing things up on this channel and I think live streams bringing them back into play could be cool,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,so if you're a replay viewer right now uh which you may not be you might not even be seeing this YouTube algorithm is going to take some time to catch up to my live streams and put me on the map here but let me know if you're down for that idea so here we go bitcoin's next rally will get a jump start from three things and there's more than just three things but here we go the FED has to stop tightening this is what's going on right now and then we're actually going to talk about actually some Bitcoin charts and technical analysis and and price movement right now in the short and long term and what to anticipate but as the Federal Reserve embarked on its hiking campaign to stop out inflation Bitcoin fell with other assets obviously Bitcoins it's really rhyming and reflecting just traditional markets here's S&P500 it's all over the place kind of up in the upward Trend since October but still it's indecisive it's trying to figure out and there's potentially a big fall in play so that's one point right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,and it relies on factors like this economic factors decisions from the FED what is going on if the FED does shift that would certainly be good for Bitcoin so when that fed pivot comes and again this plays into this Bitcoin season that is coming they're going to Pivot eventually whether it's just them straight up coming out and pivoting or something really bad happening where they're forced to Pivot they're going to Pivot right and then whether bitcoin's capitulating first and then making the turn we're getting ready for that to happen and I just look in this time frame up to the next having and I just tell myself it could be just somewhere within that that time frame that it happens and that would be just so on point with previous Cycles that's so that's number one so the Bitcoin having needs to be needs to recapture its magic okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,so now we're talking about the Bitcoin having roughly every four years the reward for correctly guessing the answer gets cut in half a process that helps the limit token Supply arguably drives up its price the scarcity factor in Bitcoin amongst other things it says every time having is approached in the past token prices have risen and it really is true so this is playing into this next season that's coming for Bitcoin it's the repetitiveness of this is it guaranteed no but I think just like many of you I'm sitting here watching and saying if this repeats I'm kind of I mean I kind of want to be ready right not just for Bitcoin but just for the entire crypto market so moving on to the next piece of this institutions need to be more comfortable owning crypto the fundamental thesis of Bitcoin has been tested a lot and it's not necessarily been up to Snuff and I think I think it actually I think it is up to Snuff actually the thing is it hasn't it's there is the thesis Bitcoin solves so many issues,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,Bitcoin is scarce Bitcoin brings into play Financial sovereignty for all of us right so when we go and we look at what's going on in terms of Institutions and in terms of the adoption of it well it kind of is most recently even starting if you just look at a Bitcoin chart and again Bitcoin chart just acts as a really nice visualization but this all this happening right fair market that's fine that's the cycles of Bitcoin it's been very rough from for the stock market everything that's fine but what's happening what was happening here I can't stress this enough it's on points with Bitcoin Cycles but please remember Banks were failing here right so that underlying thesis I really think for Bitcoin is actually up to Snuff it's it's finally starting to kind of come to fruition and manifest itself before before our eyes and and the way that that's happening isn't just,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,hey the charts are up banks are falling it's proving itself but just look at what is going on everybody and this is this is kind of pivoting into what we actually opened with in this video two major 2024 presidential candidates are both publicly pro-bitcoin having a bitcoiner as a United States president is inevitable so that's this is big right so the reason why that's happening the reason why we have headlines like this this cycle these weren't headlines in the last cycle just put yourself in the last cycle put yourself in the last election Bitcoin was hardly crypto was hardly a topic right now look at the headlines it's front and center it's it's it's on stage Bitcoin has the main stage Ron DeSantis tells Elon Musk Bitcoin will die if Joe Biden is reelected you have every right to do Bitcoin to do Bitcoin I love it the Santa said the only reason these people in Washington don't like it because they can't control it how on point is that right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,and obviously he's running to become president we know that a lot of people say things they don't mean I will say DeSantis he says things and very often is the case that he implements them and so when he's saying this I I tend to believe him obviously let's see what happens if he's in the position to kind of have authority on this issue Bitcoin represents a threat to them they're trying to regulate it out of existence so the thing is he's not even being cautious in terms of what he's saying that is exactly true this is exactly what US crypto holders say all the time this is a threat to their control this is a threat you know us as just people people across the world having that Financial sovereignty and the control over your money that's that's the thesis here and that imagine a threat,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,right so having a candidate multiple candidates in this race highlighting this as a main topic this is huge for Bitcoin season I'm telling you the current regime clearly they have it out for Bitcoin DeSantis said and if it continues for another four years they'll probably end up killing it so kind of he's obviously putting in that Fear Factor uh if you don't vote for me bitcoin's gonna die is essentially what he just what he just alluded to and then it's just all of that happening everybody so we have all of these factors that we just lined out right institutions Bitcoin having is coming up once again the FED is going to stop tightening and then it's also this factor and the other thing is I haven't even talked about this it's this I tweeted this yesterday Bitcoin seems so stagnant right now obviously it does right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,we're in this phase it's it's harsh but Bitcoin is getting ready to enter its first bull cycle as an entire web3 ecosystem D5 ordinals which are Bitcoin nfts the rc20 tokens the next crypto bull market will be like nothing we have experienced some of you might not care about Bitcoin nfts right and that's cool that's completely fine some of you don't care about new tokens launching on Bitcoin in the same way that they had that it happened on ethereum and is now happening on chains like cardano some of you might not care about defy on bitcoin that is completely okay but if you're a fan of crypto if you're a fan of Bitcoin in general and you want to see the continuation of these markets what's happening in terms of Bitcoin ecosystem really is so big on top of all these things that we just discussed it's not guaranteed and I tell myself this a lot right the world is crazy the the volatility is crazy and let me know in the comments if you agree with this but it really it really is on Pace,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,and I say that within context to bitcoin it could fall right now right Bitcoin could just collapse like like nothing before right if we have some especially some type of just fear event that we had in March 2020 we always have to be prepared for things like that but when it comes to the chart and the trend and all of the things now that are lending itself as fuel to bitcoin this is why Bitcoin season is coming up in terms of this chart we're on a weekly here um I want to mention this article I don't do ichimoku Cloud really on my channel but this is just another data point amongst so many other data points that we've discussed uh this analyst saying it could bring Bitcoin to a deeper drop and I want to just show that on the chart as we talk about these macro things this is a short-term thing per valcularia further declined to her twenty four thousand may be seen as a bitcoin's daily chart ichimoku Cloud momentum indicator has flipped bearish right so this is what it's looking like,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,and you can just see they're analyzing the edge to edge support tests at the bottom of that green range and they're just saying hey if it falls to the bottom of that green range and this is short-term Cycles short-term consolidations of Bitcoin interestingly enough if we go to a daily chart you can just see that twenty four thousand dollar Target they have there is is also just kind of a 24 000 Target we've had on this YouTube channel purpose is the reason I'm bringing this up is simply because when we look at these things this is short-term stuff everything in this entire video is completely geared towards long term right so yes there can be dips yes there can be short-term bearish moves,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,but I think in general it's very good to zoom out on these charts zoom out on the weekly and that's something that I I really want to continue doing obviously I do that a lot we zoom in on the charts a lot but again to just kind of re Echo what I was what I was saying at the beginning of the video and this is just this is just me talking to you guys like I'm a YouTuber out here doing content creation been through Cycles been doing this for over five years and I'm just like and I had this type of epiphany back in 2019 as we were prepping for the the last Bitcoin bowl season and it's just it's just kind of like switched things up get ready right as seasons change do some things differently and so one thing I'm I'm really exploring right now is just hanging out in a more laid-back fashion not so much straight to the TA,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,but and I want to continue doing ta but just videos like this bitcoin news crypto news talking about what's going on in crypto ecosystem because there's a lot right there's so much so this is going to be a developing thing I need to get into the habit of doing this your support everybody is huge for me as I do this uh as we grow so you know anytime you can interact you can hit that like button This Is Why Us YouTubers say that it's it's for the algorithms it's so that we can have see some success in in growth of our channels right so obviously we're here to have some fun create content but we're also just here to grow the channel so um and that's what I'm doing here growing the Channel having some fun with it continuing to have some fun with it we just endured a ridiculous bear Market did the whole YouTube thing back here in the last bear Market you all know especially if you were on the journey we had some fun right here it was some fun,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,and it's something that I'm very much preparing for once again is that guaranteed absolutely not do we all hope it happens absolutely it will be fun but right now I'm just thinking of some tweaks to my content because it's become repetitive for me as we kind of are in this weird consolidation range right we're not even in a drastic bear cycle we're not in a crazy cool Bowl cycle we're just in this like sideways type of deal so um those are my thoughts for today everybody and that's what's going on as far as I can see in Bitcoin land I see all the chats I see everybody out there I appreciate you all I really do um and as we mature this thing will definitely just continue to tweak as needed and just have some fun with it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPBhCda1SmU,so everybody hit the like on your way out that means a lot to me let me know in the comments if you're rewatching this video what you think about daily live streams are you down for that and just have an awesome day because Bitcoin season is coming I'll see you in the next video God bless,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E, cardano right now being squeezed in between supports and resistance it's got a lot to prove kind of even in the short term but it's not just the charts that has a lot to prove it's also just and this is nothing new it's just in this world of cryptocurrency cardano continuing to have to go on the defense my YouTube channel I mean we've been through a lot on this YouTube channel covering cardano we've been through a ton and a lot of that having to do with defending cardano something happening before we get into the charts and we talk about actually what it's contending with potential next move next Target for cardano before we even talk about that on the short term and I know it's been kind of grueling sideways,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,I want to go over this article that I came across today this is this is insane to Me cardano Network faces major problem swaps take 30 minutes so we're going to discuss this do swaps on cardano take 30 minutes I'm gonna lay it down for you very simply cardano is currently facing a significant issue despite hoskinson's earlier claims that the cardano network could theoretically handle up to a staggering 1 million transactions per second the reality is turning out to be quite different the first thing I notice here is this isn't this is a narrative grab they're they're running with their own narrative based on really nothingness and let me explain and they're obviously alluding to and talking about Hoskins in here and by the way Charles not the biggest fan of Me by the way many people might not even realize that Charles not the biggest fan of me I think mainly for a thumbnail that I did in the summer that he didn't like but again I don't care I'll sit here and defend the network I defend Charles all the time users are experiencing delays with some swaps on cardano-based decentralized exchanges taking up to 30 minutes to complete this is the headline everybody this is the first thing I want you to realize this is the headline this was yesterday,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,but I I needed to do a video on this because I cover cardano so much this is the headline in the week or within the weeks where cardano is absolutely exploding and you can go to tap tools and you can just look at all the projects obviously we had a recent meme coin explosion people just having a blast on cardano myself just having some fun my friends having some fun this tweet really puts it very nicely they just said I've not heard anything about this from anyone on cardano Twitter what did I miss my transactions are well within a couple minutes max every time with defy and so the thread goes on and there's you know a lot of people talking about it and it's true for me too and let me know in the comments below I've been using minswap a ton and it's just like I very simply place a swap and it very quickly goes through,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,and I think a lot of times if price is out of range it won't go through until your price is back in range that's why you want to use things like slippage in those in those kind of more volatile times but other than that that happens right where are the headlines about 100 plus dollar ethereum swaps for fees where are the headlines in terms of ethereum hacks where are the headlines in terms of ethereum just failed transactions right stuff like that happens so maybe there's instances where there were long swaps and you can actually even see in the article if you actually scroll down there's this comment section and in the comments section here's somebody bringing up Sunday swap orders could take up to 10 days to complete during the launch week of Sunday swap how can anyone possibly be surprised this was literally when like the the decks culture was coming online on cardano and Sunday swap was leading the way in terms of that happening,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,but right now I can't say this enough I've been so happy with cardano defy and just cardano Dex is working and actually just being able to go into tap tools look at coins go swap coins if I want and it's just a better interface it's a better it's a better process I think than something like ethereum,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,and you know the article goes on cardano has been hailed as a revolutionary ethereum killer boasting an impressive array of technical capabilities and aiming to deliver an unrivaled user experience so they're basically saying cardano has failed in that regard however the recent problem of time consuming swaps is a major setback for the network and I just want to do a very a very simple video going over this just saying there's no setback there's no setback cardano will continue to improve obviously cardano will be continue to become more scalable especially within the era that we're in and and the builders that are building from a technical perspective and the tweaking that is being done from a technical perspective but try try it try it try cordano and just see if there's any setback um potentially undermining its position as a leading player in the defy sector if anything the last couple of weeks cardano is gaining ground and traction of being a leading player in the D5 sector so I'm very excited about that so I wanted to bring that up it's obviously a headline from yesterday,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,but I think it's important just to put this out there because I cover cardano so much what I want to talk about in terms of technical analysis and what's going on with cardano is is this very simply just first the support and resistance that I talked about in the beginning of the video cardano's obviously been sideways we know it's it's grueling it's tough for me to even do videos sometimes when it's like this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,but two things number one we have the Fibonacci from the swing low back here which is very critical at this time and it's been critical for like probably weeks now since May 8th or so swing low to swing High we have just this higher low Fibonacci and you can see Bitcoin trending just at that 618 line right here that that's a support area it's a just higher low support error you can you can see the channel goes down to the 786 right around 33 cents a 10 drop for cardano is still very much in play if cardano needs to consolidate further to the downside I'd be watching that 786 around 33 cents as a support area now it's kind of just between though that support area right here and this the 20-day moving average which recently just crossed below the 50-day moving average so you can just see it's getting squeezed in between these two areas and it's very interesting to see which direction is it going to break there are some concerns I think in terms of really just general sentiment in markets not just crypto even if markets are going to continue to the downside it's a pretty clear scenario for for cardano to fall to the downside and I want to show you actually and illustrate a picture of what that looks like then we can talk about upside but if we go over here to this six hour chart I kind of highlighted this area back here we spot very similar structures and just setups all the time in crypto and they become very helpful in times like this when we're when we're analyzing certain areas we were looking for a support area and this we can call it our confirmation area meaning if cardano succeeds in having support here we could get a very explosive move and that would be because it diverges from what is very much in play and the picture is setting up we take our barge pattern and what I'm going to be highlighting is this move back here this consolidation move back here before this big fall and this was this was a capitulation bear Market low type of fall remember this is a very big fall not saying the fall would be this big but this is the setup let's get our barge pattern and you can see this consolidation that's that's happening back here is looking extremely similar to what's happening right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
KHHwJVrP68E,so if we take our barge pattern that consolidation to even the swing low we can even just put swing low to the turnaround and we kind of just bring it over look at this look at this structure and this setup so similar to what cardano did then,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,so if this were to be the case and cardano is getting ready to actually fall this would mean support is failing but we use this now and this is just me this is how I do my ta this is how I watch the charts if cardano diverges from bear scenario bear Market low scenario if it diverges and actually starts trending upwards and away from this move a move down that's a bullish confirmation in my view and if that's the picture that starts playing out we can really start talking about continuation of this General move that cardano is in we're now on a weekly chart in the general move being the bear Market low and just higher lows right and and continuation and what will be very interesting for cardano is as this is all happening how does it interact with this 20-week moving average around 37 some cents the 50-week moving average around 39 to 40 right around 40 cents,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
KHHwJVrP68E,this area right here if cardano diverges from this ugly picture of a downtrend or of a just short-term capitulation whatever you want to call a dip if if cardano diverges from that this could be the setup for cardano to get back above these very key moving averages that you know are very important to us in the major shift of just bear Market to bull market right and this doesn't mean we're entering a bull market but it's just the shift we want to see the 20 week above the 50-week moving average and the story of that getting done is is cardano closing weekly candles above those areas even if it's going to fall back down again and revisit those those moving averages so it all kind of starts here though and if you really just look at this the consolidation that happened back here right and then just kind of consolidates and then fall we are getting very close time frame wise even to a move happening right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,so we could say this next few days this next week something big might be ready to happen and we we always hope so right because the sideways trading is insane but what happens when that move happens are we seeing support hold here and diverge back up is it just breaking out now or is it falling and failing at this support area because if that's the case then even then actually it becomes a story of well where is that low going to be and if it happens that means the low is probably actually getting very close right so there's a ton of cushion for cardano remember the swing low for the bear Market was back here 23 24 cents so there's a ton of room for cardano to consolidate could it be a double a midterm double bottom bottom right around 30 cents right,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
KHHwJVrP68E,is that where it's going to go to so slightly below this support area we'd be looking for some type of consolidation before the bounce because remember on this daily chart if that's happening that would mean cardano is falling close to oversold and usually when we get oversold areas what happens it's a balance of some sort so that's what I'm watching on cardano right now I really think the key the key takeaway of this video though is be careful with the headlines that you look at and hopefully many of you are very deep in cardano you know this was kind of just just you know that fear uncertainty and doubt type of headline really trying to create a narrative that's not right it is not real in terms of cardano nothing's perfect no blockchain is running perfectly maybe there are instances where it's where there's a problem and somebody tweets about it but come on this ecosystem is exploding right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
KHHwJVrP68E,and you can't even you it's hard to even look the other way when it's happening right now on cardano and on Twitter so this article just wanted to throw it out there so that we can kind of throw it out but let me know your thoughts everybody did you see that what were your thoughts about that what do you think is next for cardano price as we continue the track the volatility or lack thereof I appreciate you cruising by tonight I hope you have a great rest of your night hit the Subscribe and like I will see you in the next video God bless,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk, man it's a cardano chart we're gonna we're gonna look at the Ada charts in this video but can we just talk about for one just brief moment what is going on with cardano defy what is going on with cardano defy right now so D5 summer of 2020 the bullish D5 summer of 2020 is about to happen on cardano and there's so much involved in that too like that story of that happening there's so many moving pieces I could probably do so many videos on that and I feel like I really want to start creating some content in relation to these things so let's do technical analysis in the last half this video but we're going to start with talking about cardano defy summer and some of the things that are happening right now now hit the Subscribe hit that like button for me let's do it first things first if you're kind of new to this and watching this and you're like what's defy summer if I summer refers to the season of summer in 2020.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,this period resulted in the emergence of viable or alternatives to traditional centralized Finance called decentralized apps that offered an array of inclusive financial services such as yield farming lending borrowing and insurance and you can go to something like defy llama and you can get in a sense of all things defy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,so if you want to just spot projects that probably came about in that defy summer the explosion of defy which mind you cardano did not have yet cardano lagging in that regard but building such as solid secure decentralized infrastructure now this is what we're looking at defy llama you see ethereum binance smart train or binance smart chain you go down number 15 cardano now D5 is coming online working its way up and does it stop at 15 I highly highly doubt that I think cardano is going to rock it itself up into the top of this list and that's a that's a steady progress right that takes some time but we're getting hints of it right now and this is why we call it cardano defy summer and this is from a few days ago start of cardano's D5 summer propels it into top 15 blockchain by volume cardano has recently experienced a surge in its defy volume thanks to the emergence of more decentralized protocols in the popularity of community focused meme coins like snack cardano has climbed the ranks to become one of the top 15 blockchains in terms of D5 volume and you go over here to cardano and just look at it everybody look at this chart just all-time highs in terms of total value locks in cardano D5 look at that and so you see this too and you can you can scroll down in from a micro perspective on these projects and see for yourself what is actually happening you go over here and we are it's it's happening everybody this is the first time I'm mentioning this in a video snack and and I hope it's appreciated why I take time in covering these things in a video but it's approaching 50 Milli market cap that's something uh that I've been waiting for in terms of content creation but just look at this cardano based meme coin snack Dogecoin competitor and this is where things get crazy everybody this is this I've been waiting years for this I think so many of you have been waiting years for this we're talking about we're entering this cycle of crypto where cardano coins are going to be competing with and in their own sector right with ethereum coins and and all these other blockchain coins and here's a perfect example it's going to start happening in the headlines because of what's happening on Cardona right now so snack being compared to Dogecoin as a competitor and the markets need it the markets need new projects and new things to to talk about to going into this next cycle as well cardano is just it's the blockchain,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,it's the blue chip top blockchain that's going to offer exactly that so we'll talk meme coins we can talk all the different D5 projects right and you go back to something like um defy llama right we have dexes we have CDP we have lending we have I think services on here right so there's all these different types of projects that we're going to see this explosion of that is the first time cardano has ever seen it and you can just see I mean things like this happening right now snack and you know have to be extremely careful with all of these things right these are these are earlier stage projects it's very very awesome to see snack kind of and other projects are doing it as well maybe not getting as much of as much attention but it's really cool to see these projects like snack just bringing so much attention to Cardinal ecosystem this is what this is what Builders are doing in this space you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,and I think everybody has just kind of this this hand to lend in that regard I've been covering cardano and doing my best for years in my own capacity you know we've gotten like millions of views cardano views on this YouTube channel in terms of cardano and there's all these different Avenues where we can bring the attention to cardano ecosystem and what's happening The Innovation that is in play right now this is a really great example of a project doing that and you can just go over here I mean look at this this is this is tap tools and you can just see snack over here number three on tap tools uh in terms of market cap so insane to see this everybody but it's happening it's happening I saw this tweet right before I kind of started doing the video this is a 44 million dollar market cap meme coin snack without any centralized exchange listings the strength you need and resilience of the cardano community is just amazing this is 2021 cnft Vibes all over again I'll say this it's bigger than that it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,I I definitely know those vibes I definitely know those vibes at early stage cnft hype people trying things and launching things but this is bigger because this is really this is really starting to kind of seep into the broader crypto ecosystem and and and even this tweet alone kind of illustrates that just tagging things like Doge and shib and you know all these other meme coins so that's that everybody I wanted to just bring that up because it's happening right now that's that's the markets have been stagnant as you know sideways indecisive but if you go into tap tools open some of these projects and look at what's going on people are getting very interested in cardano ecosystem and it's really cool to see so let's let's talk about though cardano because it's at and I I know we say this a lot it's at a critical area it's at an important area,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,but it is because I did a video the other day and we were discussing kind of this move I believe it was this move back here and there was a very similar kind of consolidation that's happening right now the concern being if this repeats well we might be getting a swing low here in in the very near future and that's very much in play and we're actually kind of getting closer to the edge here in comparison to what happened back then in December and that was the bull that was a bear Market capitulation area so if we take we could take our barge pattern this is what we did the other day kind of just that little piece of consolidation before the fall and then you just drag it over and it's just you can see how much that's that's so similar right and a lot of similarities even and this is a six hour chart by the way but similarity is even an RSI slower moving momentum oscillator these lower highs for cardano so in that similar area where it fell we were getting a lower high structure there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,and then it was boom right back into oversold that's the concern right now but at the same time and this is what's cool about technical analysis for me is when I'm watching something just like that single data point there's other data points we're going to look at on the charts the weekly and the daily but when I'm just looking at the single chart in my mind I'm just like this and you can bring into play everything else going on in the world headlines the debt ceiling stuff what Bitcoin is going to do with price next but all these things in play if cardano diverges from this this could be a bullish signal so this very chart alone and what we're just talking about this single data point without any other indicators or anything could actually be used as an indicator right because if if cardano diverges and starts getting separation look at that just a pop above 37 38 cents that would diverge from what happened back here something different happening why is that momentum shifting well maybe it could be if it happens because it's not the bear Market low,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,but we want to anticipate a higher low for cardano we absolutely do I am right 30 to 33 cents probably that next area Target that I'd be looking for to see if cardano shows any support there but to the upside we go to the daily chart what's what's going on on the daily well it's the same thing we go to that same area of time back here on cardano cardano is seeing the 20-day moving average resistance and then it fell that we saw in the six hour same thing thing here 20-day moving average resistance is it going to fall that's what I'm careful of,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,but the question to the flip side is it going to break back above the 20 day so on this daily chart we have an indicator we can also use as kind of maybe a potential bullish confirmation at least in the short term for cardano 30 like right around just under 37 cents I mean the 20-day moving average is essentially right where cardano is right now Ken cardano make a move above that area in the short term that's my immediate question that I'll be watching and if it did could it really have the momentum to break this this this very important 50-day moving average remember the story that we're trying to get get going here it's the 50-day above the 20-day moving average in an uptrend right or I'm sorry it's not the 50 day it's the 20-day back above the 50 day in an uptrend right and that's the bull market picture it's just the 20-day floating above the 50-day,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,and so that's what we're trying to have see happen here and the path to that oftentimes in these bottoming out structures is just kind of the grappling of the two moving averages and you can just see this happening right and look at that just the grappling of the moving averages the convergence of them as everything consolidates as markets really are boring uh and kind of put us on this roller coaster ride so for this to happen we obviously need Ada to get above both moving averages and to pull that 20-day back above the 50-day moving average in blue this is the weekly chart I think and very important to note I usually like to start with the weekly chart to just start with that context that is to say my main approach here is cardano could fall into the 20s and I'm still bullish here I do not want that to happen updating my portfolio would not be fun at all if it happens I don't like it I don't enjoy it but I just want to say I mean,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
VDdPuo3Y-xk,and you know uh we've done so many videos on that 20-week moving average throughout the bear Market waiting for just this move even just the consolidation above and around the 20-week moving average it's been very good to see that but how much longer before Ada actually gets some separation above time will tell that's what I'll be watching but nonetheless everybody it doesn't matter if it takes all this time right even going into the 2024 Bitcoin having and and the shift of the cycle I don't know if there's upside or downside in play here but what I do know is the start of cardano's D5 summer is really it's it's happening and it's big and it's most important on the weekly on the zoomed out what's Happening Now is so early stage and we've been saying it for years on this YouTube channel waiting for this exact moment and it was extremely early stage then because we were we didn't even have default yet it's here everybody and it's starting to pick up steam I'm paying attention let me know in the comments below if you are too,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

bImMlD5ucug,I I looked at I was like something's happening with crypto I I said price is down right now because I knew she would immediately think like we're we're going to the Moon right now price is like flying because I'm always updating or always telling her what's going on I mentioned price is down but something's happening I just sense it I feel it and in crypto this is number one for me feelings lie emotions can't trust emotions so while I have this sense I'm extremely cautious and I want to put that out there I'm long-term bullish on crypto many of you know that but I want to explain this sense that I have because it's not the first time I've had it before I've been covering my crypto Journey on this YouTube channel for over five years and you know I I've had my own experiences in crypto that I really want to just try and portray to you why I'm thinking this way so right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bImMlD5ucug,and we're going to look at the charts we're going to look at some of these examples that I have in this video we're going to jump on a computer in a minute right now we have things like meme coins over the last couple of weeks and that that's actually one thing that plays into this sense that I have but we have meme coins just you know making moves things are happening on on that front people are actually making some money for the first time it seems in a while and so that's one thing that's happening so I just want to be clear though that's not why I have this sense not because of that that's one thing but that's not why so please hit the Subscribe as we jump into this video and I explain to you what I'm thinking hit the like your support really does mean a lot to me and let's just do this price is down I get it this is a six hour chart bitcoin price down you zoom out on the chart,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bImMlD5ucug,look we've been here before you zoom even out more on the chart look we've been here before this happens all the time it doesn't matter if we're in a bear Market or a bull market this video kind of does carry a more of a bullish sentiment a bullish tone to it but I want to try and step outside of the charts a bit more on my YouTube channel and just have a conversation with you all about what I'm thinking about the broader scope of Bitcoin and crypto cardano we're going to talk about that in this video I really want to step outside and try and open up that conversation a little bit more and do a better job of that so yeah price is down right now and even on the short term this is just a chart resetting you see the momentum on bitcoin resetting entering oversold it's where opportunity oftentimes begins right,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bImMlD5ucug,but this is not a technical analysis video I want to in this video piggyback off of the intro of this video and talk about why I think crypto will never be the same I have this extremely bullish sense in terms of what is happening with crypto and what's getting ready to happen and I just want to try and illustrate very simply some key points as it relates to bitcoin and as it relates to even cardano so let me just start here we've been talking about on Twitter a little bit I think I might have mentioned in a video brc20 tokens they're here on bitcoin not erc20 tokens market cap 725 million earlier I think was earlier today was approaching a billion I'm going to go over some tweets just to kind of try and encapsulate what I'm saying here and this this guy over here on Twitter is he just has great tweets when it comes to what's happening on bitcoin right now summing up some key data this was earlier today brc20 market cap 848 million erc20 market cap 159 billion ERC market cap is erc20 tokens on ethereal 159 billion not and ethereum's not the number one chain Bitcoin is the OG Bitcoin is the chain not even a billion right there and you can just see the illustration right there is just a starting point,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bImMlD5ucug,okay and brc20 tokens are here it's happening not only that this was today there has been a single brc20 token listed on a single uh centralized exchange for less than 24 hours and it's already crossed 100 million dollars in volume what is going to happen when dozens of brc20 tokens are listed on dozens of centralized exchanges so it's not just like brc20 tokens or on bitcoin they're complicated and a week ago they were and they still are kind of complicated exchanges are running with these and you better believe exchanges when it comes to getting their hands on this Market they're going to come on board because technically they can they can now and we just saw listings are going to start happening in terms of BRC 20 tokens and we have this ordinals nfts on bitcoin just hit an all-time high of over 2.7 million dollars spent on inscription fees in a single day look at this chart this is insane so what's so crazy to me is there is just all of this happening with Bitcoin right now and this is what really plays into this sense that I get every cycle there's something,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bImMlD5ucug,new happening right and some of those things could happen repetitively cycle after cycle right maybe meme coins that's going to be one of those things that plays into the sense but I think there's also new things that happen which usher in to play brand new opportunity that we haven't seen in crypto before and one piece of that is what's happening on bitcoin web3 coming onto Bitcoin this usher in this ushers in a brand new playing field meaning crypto really will never be the same now because of what's Happening Here with Bitcoin and look at this I mean this is 725 million dollar market cap so this also I just wanted to throw this out there because it's cool uh this is actually a game inscribed on bitcoin you can go play a game it's sitting on bitcoin on a SAT and I'm not going to get into details about how that technically works because I can't explain it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bImMlD5ucug,but how cool is that so we have a whole new playing field right now and then the same exact type of vibe is happening and this is something we've waited years for the whole web 3 on bitcoin that that came at me like a couple in february-ish like whoa I did not anticipate this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bImMlD5ucug,and I became so bullish on bitcoin because of that this is something we've waited years for I said I've had I've never had so much fun using cardano it's finally here waited years for this and this was like yesterday at 7 55 7 57 p.m Sunday Swap and Min swap have been great we've talked about for so long just even before the dexes were here like Sunday Swap and stuff imagine the world when us Ada holders are trading tokens on cardano just like we were doing or people were doing on ethereum years and years ago early stage when Sunday swap came on this or not Sunday swap when uniswap came on the scene imagine when cardano has that Vibe but on a more solid scalable infrastructure cheaper infrastructure meaning cheaper fees it's happening and I can't tell you this last yesterday was just kind of it really hit home for me and the meme coin culture it it comes into play when it comes to exposure of cardano a lot of people don't like meme coins I'm not going to sit here and cover meme coins on my YouTube channel I'm not going to Tweet about them that's not my style,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bImMlD5ucug,but I will absolutely recognize the fact that when it comes to the mass amounts of people that are going to be exposed to this really cool technology that I think is going to absolutely outperform which is cardano what's going to bring those people it's going to be things like meme coins and we just in the last few days we absolutely just saw that cardano getting so much exposure because of it but once that exposure's here it's like wait a second if you're used and if you're out there using these dexes and if you're you're trading mean coins or any other coin you might just be like this is and this is really where it hit home for me in the last few days I really realized I knew you could you know go buy a token on on these dexes but it really hit home for me when like last night I just couldn't sleep I was having so much fun with it and that's what I've been waiting for and it's here on cardano now and this is taptools.io this isn't sponsored but it's just really cool to be on their site their site,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bImMlD5ucug,I think destroys Dex tools which is kind of on ethereum for for ethereum tokens this is tap tools over on cardano just a solid site and I tweeted I said it looks like cardano community's crash tap tools because it was 3 A.M last night I couldn't sleep I was on here doing things and tap tools went down this is what's happening on cardano and I want to say everything I'm talking about this video the bull market has not even started this is like pre-bull cycle for me and it's these things happening for me that says opportunities is here in a different way and it doesn't mean that there's not risk there's tons of risk with all of this especially the meme coin stuffs and and stuff and trading on decks and stuff but for me this is something that I've seen happen before prior to Cycles right,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bImMlD5ucug,and then if you just go and we look at what's going on with a Bitcoin chart for instance and you go to a weekly chart I remind myself 20-week moving average across the 50 week this is a big deal from a macro perspective it doesn't mean we're we're going to moon right now but look this was the end of that last bear Market that type of move and there were sideways and then it happened again the 20 week above the 50. we're we're on the macro getting ready to enter something really special and it's a very fact that all of these new things are happening prior to that that just it's that wind when you open the door and you sense something is coming and that's where I am right now it's Innovation it's opportunity it's all of that combined into all of these things like Bitcoin and cordano,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bImMlD5ucug,so I just wanted to and there's so much more I just wanted to really kind of put that out there because this is really what's been on my mind all weekend I didn't even do technical analysis videos because I've really been just entrenched in trying to wrap my head around all of these things that are happening all these moving parts and try and find my approach to these things again this is just how I see it there's no guarantees this is very risky space but I'm really bullish on crypto so let me know your thoughts in the comments below I really uh like to see what y'all y'all are thinking I'm going to be covering all of this stuff especially web 3 on bitcoin a lot more getting ready to launch a project on bitcoin hopefully it serves as a lot of value to all of you out there that are into Bitcoin and Bitcoin ecosystem I'm really excited about I'm going to be just talking about it a lot I don't care if it's it's topics that don't get all the views and you know we're not talking about price,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bImMlD5ucug,but I'm excited to really kind of open up that conversation because what's happening now I think is just a lot of opportunity within it so let me know your thoughts again in the comments below hit the Subscribe hit the like I'll see in the next video God bless,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
76z0a8wrWYk, it's a bullish title for this Bitcoin video this is Bitcoin zoomed out on the weekly there's a macro indicator that is signaling very bullish macro zoomed out if you're okay with having a macro bullish conversation this video is for you but I just want to say kind of intertwined in this bullish story is maybe potentially some short to midterm bearishness and I want to break down all that data and show you exactly the trend that Bitcoin is in right now as it relates to this very bullish signal so please hit the Subscribe hit the like let's Dive Right into this data this is Bitcoin on the weekly and we're actually we're gonna as we dig into this data we're gonna go all the way back to like 2013 even all these data points really signaling where Bitcoin is right now and what might be next so this is an article kind of describing what's going on bitcoin's realized price on cusp of flashing major bullish signal now this indicator that we're discussing on this zoomed out this realized price signal is something that happens very few times over the years right,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
76z0a8wrWYk,and we're going to look at what that looks like the cryptos realize price looks set to cross above the average on-chain acquisition price of long-term holders indicating a prolonged bullish period ahead we're going to look at a very nice illustration that just shows you what this is saying bitcoin's realized price is the average value of Bitcoin Supply calculated at the price at which coins were last moved on chain the long-term holder realized price reflects the average on-chain acquisition price price for coins held outside centralized exchanges and not moved for at least 155 days I want to show you this chart this is what we're looking at Bitcoin prices in Black realize price is in blue long-term holder realized price in green,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
76z0a8wrWYk,so what we're seeing here let me zoom in a little bit we're seeing this potential Cross of realized price in blue coming above that green line the long-term holder realized price that's the bullish signal that we are looking for and you can see it happened last cycle circled in red before the major bull run it happened the cycle before that before the major Bull Run happens cycle before that before the major Bull Run going back to 2013 the chart shows the Blue Line representing the realize price could soon cross above the green line so the markets and again I say this all the time the consistency on bitcoin charts they're just it's just insane to look at the consistencies so these macro signals to watch the consistency of those happen like this one the realized price signal really cool but as we dig into the data yes on the zoomed out on the long term incredibly bullish for this next cycle that we're going into especially as this next having approaches,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
76z0a8wrWYk,but if we really start looking at well though that signal right when we're looking at this chart when this was happening what did Bitcoin actually do not in the long term we know what will happen long-term all-time highs in the next cycle what did it do in the short to midterm and this is where it gets interesting this is kind of where it's like all right patience a little bit of a warning on the short to midterm potential downside on the short to midterm but if you're a long-term holder if you're a long-term thinker this is still bullish so 2019 it was June 2019 that signal happened right and look at this and we've been doing a lot of comparison to this move uh compared to where we are in Bitcoin but look Bitcoin getting ready to fall and the fall that I I want to track there is kind of Swing High to this swing low it's a 52 fall for Bitcoin after that incredibly bullish signal hits right the macro bullet signal hit Bitcoin fell 50 or so now if we go back and we look at bullish back here 2016.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
76z0a8wrWYk,look at this this was right before Bitcoin maybe a week or two I'm not sure exactly the week that that bullish indicator went Bitcoin fell 40-some percent to the downside right around 40 to the downside go back to 2013. even Bitcoin put in that macro signal that bullish crazy signal,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
76z0a8wrWYk,and you can just see Bitcoin went parabolic but even in the short term it actually fell as about 20 or so every time this indicator has signaled Bitcoin actually pretty close like pretty close to when it happened or just weeks later basically has fallen and that leaves us with a question right now and this is something that we analyze when we're talking about short-term analysis we have targets to downside all the time right we have targets that we've just been tracking I mean if I go to a six hour chart just look at this we have even this higher low area for Bitcoin that is in play this is a six hour chart this swing low back here to the swing High Bitcoin does have downside right Bitcoin could hit twenty four thousand twenty two thousand dollars testing this higher low area of support that would be a fall from where Bitcoin is of right around 18 ultimately a total fall of around 28 we know that's in play from the short-term technical analysis targets but when we go to the weekly chart it becomes interesting to just get that dynamic in play just in your own mind for me as I'm watching this right because I sit here and I know that I'm long-term bullish we have the having coming up we have so much happening in terms of Bitcoin and crypto offering now a true adoption use case to the world and the macroeconomic failures of the financial system right,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
76z0a8wrWYk,that's in play this cycle more than any other cycle so the scarcity factor for Bitcoin I think plays even more into what could potentially happen going into the next cycle similar to what we saw before but interestingly enough even as we have all these bullish indicators even as we have on-chain metrics signaling this bullish indicator that same exact bullish indicator also signaling potentially there is downside in play and the question is and this is a different answer for everybody as I sit here you sit there we we absorb this data the question is how do you approach that right and for me I like to just know hey I am macro bullish but I know there's downside in play and I'd like to see bullish indicators that are macro bullish indicators that even say there's downside in play namely this indicator right here because it just helps me prepare for downside when we look at these short-term targets these midterm targets to the downside they become more possible and real when we start looking at indicators like this that are bullish but potentially short-term bearish so this is all a preparation tool,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
76z0a8wrWYk,everybody it's a visualization tool I'm not here to predict anything of what's going to happen next it's just me just tracking the journey tracking the charts tracking the data and trying to find and navigate my own way through these charts but I would say this the most important point for me as I'm talking about all this is the very fact that Bitcoin is on schedule almost identical to previous cycles and if it was going to be almost identical and continue that that reflection of previous Cycles it would actually see more downside right if that signal really Triggers on this chart previous or similar to previous markets we saw a downside we just need to be ready for downside maybe it doesn't happen we have a lot to track from a technical analysis perspective all the convergence of these moving averages below Bitcoin right now the 20 week around 25 000 right the 50 week all the way down here around 22 000.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
76z0a8wrWYk,there's a lot going on on all the charts but one thing that remains true and I think important for me to remember is on the macro zoomed out on schedule on track bitcoin's bullish in the long term and that really just helps me navigate through all of these markets let me know your thoughts in the comments below what you think about this please hit the Subscribe hit the like I hope this was valuable to you on your own crypto Journey I'll see in the next video God bless,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
3Ajh7-y59o0, Bitcoin and cardano the power couple that's what I want to talk about in this video it's a new change of scenery because I'm really just tired of doing the charts when they're not doing anything so Bitcoin and cardano is gonna I was in the office the studio whatever you want to call and it's pretty dark in there and I'm trying to prepare a video and just tracking the technical analysis of it all and it's just continued consolidation I thought you know what why don't I just do a video just laid back talking with you all about Bitcoin and cardano it really is in my view of power couple play if you look at my content obviously these are the two that I cover over the years this is like the two main for me and I just want to explain why so hit the Subscribe also on your way in that means a lot to me and thank you for that and the like and let's just talk about it so I'll start with Bitcoin and then we can talk about cardano,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,but I mean Bitcoin it's it's it's the OG it's the it's the crypto that so many people that don't even know about crypto know about right just by hearing about it and it really is it's just that Innovation that came into play over a decade ago you know in Bitcoin opening at like zero .0008 it started then do you know what I mean it started with the white paper and it's this this deflationary store of value that that offers this opportunity of financial self-sovereignty to to people across the world it's it's this main Narrative of crypto for from a lot of many a lot of different perspectives and so it's a starting point Bitcoin is huge and it's going to continue to grow in my opinion now I've covered it a lot over the years I mean it's been probably the most foundational crypto on my YouTube channel since I started my YouTube channel over five years ago,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,but right now 2023 I've got I've I've gone to this new level of excitement with Bitcoin and a lot of that excitement kind of stems from my excitement that I have with altcoins like cardano right or even ethereum you can see things being that have been built on ethereum over the years that are just cool they're a little different right Bitcoin is actually starting to tap into that market and that is web three right so we have you know this number one crypto it's been kind of just the same type of thing it's a store value it's digital gold but now web 3 is coming to bitcoin and that's really exciting me so we're talking about web3 coming to bitcoin uh we're talking about ordinals which are nfts on bitcoin it's happening right now I've been really discussing it I started getting heavily into it in February just my own time me and my buddy and I'm not like crazy posting content about it because I've just been enjoying it myself and learning about it,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,but just that whole concept and if you look into the Bitcoin ecosystem and what's being built now it is a whole new Vibe out of nowhere that's happening tons of startups tons of companies payments infrastructure you know ordinal ecosystem obviously wallets social identity all of these different things that you wouldn't ever really associated with Bitcoin because bitcoin's just Bitcoin it's a it's a digital gold right that's that's what it's good for and so we have all of this Innovation and this new Vibe coming to bitcoin and that really excites me and lastly and this really actually threads into cardano really importantly this is kind of foundational to my video as a whole it's it's this thought of community when you think of Bitcoin Community or cardano Community or xrp Community you kind of segment it's segmented right and so for Bitcoin even within Bitcoin it's segmented you have like Bitcoin maximalists now you have just the Bitcoin nft kind of culture is there and it's segmented all these different uh areas just people that are invested in Bitcoin and are like only care about price but it's Bitcoin community,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,and it's kind of the the collaboration of those communities coming together and now as we enter this new world and it's been happening more and more recently over the last couple of years this multi-chain world we're starting to see all of these kind of tentacles right extend from Bitcoin the OG the digital gold and all of these different highways opening up that I think are going to create a lot of opportunity for multiple communities across multiple cryptos to connect to engage to innovate to build together and I don't know what that world looks like just yet but what I do know is I see the Innovation being built on bitcoin right now it's exciting I myself and and exploring that with a business partner of mine and when we're we're doing that right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,but what does that look like from a community perspective because this is where it ties into cardano obviously I like Bitcoin now I pivot to cardano cardano's just it's it's special on a different level and ever since I got into I think probably 2020 is when I really started covering it on my YouTube channel it's grown in different phases for me in terms of why it's special initially it was very intriguing when my buddy brought it up to me and told me to look at look just look into it a little bit more deeply it was very much intriguing to me from a charting perspective I do technical analysis I saw the chart it was sub 10 cents I saw where it was before I saw where it could be going especially if they delivered on just all the technicals and we're talking about proof of stake we're talking about smart contracts all these things and you all know how that played out they delivered they delivered,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,but I saw all these things from as a value investor and that really intrigued me at first so that's like layer number one and then layer number two was kind of like just getting a sense of uh what type of innovation actually is possible with this now and and actually seeing proof of stake come come into fruition and as as myself running running the nodes and and building my own crypto Capital Venture Community uh as just just this community that's taking part in the consensus mechanism of cardano that was like this new deeper layer where I'm actually like involved in the technology to some regard where we're actually like playing into and helping the network run and move and that was cool to me and then as this kind of went on right I I launched an nft project a collection that's out there and you know some people some people are not vibing with that collection fully in the long term and that's okay but it's something that I tried it's something that I just jumped out there and I did,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,and I think that's what the space is all about and cardano for me not just as a content creator but just as a person has allowed me to kind of just creatively just learn number one crypto and number two just think about what's possible cardano has really really helped me in that regard from an education perspective why why are things possible right when we start talking about decentralization and staking and staking mechanism and we start talking about scalability and what that will allow and we start watching how D5 actually is able to start coming online we've we've seen this story just play out with cardano from kind of nothingness through the eras so nothingness and then all of a sudden it's proof of stake right the staking mechanism and then The multi-asset Ledger and then spark contracts and scalability right and and now all these projects are coming online,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,we see total value locked coming on you know just Rising all-time high like we haven't seen yet we haven't seen something like this in my opinion since ethereum years and years and years ago and that's exciting to me and then all of this ties into and all like all the ups and downs that I've been through on my own cardano Journey ties into Community just getting to know people within cardano it's just such a different just a different feel right than Bitcoin and Bitcoin has its own specialness right but something special about cardano and we're talking people that I just didn't even know for years or people disagreed with right or disagree with me and starting to connect with those people and starting to really get to to know the community has been extremely special to me and it's just the vision of cardano the vision of community and now when you start just,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,and I know I'm shoving a lot within 10 minutes it's a 10 minute video but when you start just looking at the scope of cardano and what I just laid out and what's coming the story that's progressing right progressively being told and you look at Bitcoin and the story that's even there developing and it excites me that there's a developing story and it's bigger than just Bitcoin a store of value right now there's there's there's a new kind of innovation coming on board I think I think most people are not even aware of right now um I think the ordin like ordinals and there's BRC 20 tokens now sitting at like a total of 100 million dollar market cap a hundred million dollar market cap if you think of the market out for erc20 tokens on ethereum it's we are at the early stages right now with Bitcoin and so all of these Vibes where you can build on bitcoin you can build on cardano or you can just you know engage,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,and you can be a part of that community see these communities coming together in some way and and there's going to be so many different ways that other projects kind of link to other other projects on other communities but I'm so interested in that I'm so interested in the community aspect of it right we have cardano Community we have Bitcoin community and I just want to see it less segmented and I I really want to and it's not to say everybody has to be a fan of Bitcoin and cordano and every crypto but I really like the thought of what does it look like when the communities come together what does it look like if you're sitting in this huge conference room right and there's a bunch of Bitcoin and cardano holders you're not just at a conference for cardano or a conference for Bitcoin what happens when there's so much Innovation happening cross-chain that people can't help but be at a conference where it's really just like Bitcoin and cardano people and I like the thought of that especially because I just I'm a fan of Bitcoin and I'm a fan of cardano,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3Ajh7-y59o0,so I like the thought of the two coming together from a community perspective and I'm a content creator Community is like is the coolest part of crypto for me right obviously we track the charts and everything but like Community is a huge piece of it so those are my thoughts on bitcoin and cardano and I just wanted to throw it out there and kind of get your thoughts let me know below what you think about these two and if you agree with anything I said hit the Subscribe hit the like I'll see you in the next video God bless,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

YYtgVvSnz_A,and it's very easy to say yeah a bit Mex if you don't like Bitcoin cash I'm not sure if this is the right way to go I'm not sure if it's really worth deciding what you're gonna do with people's funds I think potentially they should have the option but then the counter-argument is if you wanted control of your Bitcoin why did you give it to an exchange they can kind of do what they want so this is excellent commentary I like social commentary if you haven't noticed I tried to put a little bit of social commentary into my intros that's very apt at least on cryptocurrency reddit someone investigated the deep dark abyss of coin market cap page two and three and they've brought us back their findings just found out there is a theorem gold and aetherium cash it's true they exist ecash I thought that was a joke too legit project I'm deep in boys just realize there is litecoin gold - I have unearthed neo gold we have just reached singularity just discovered Z cash gold I don't necessarily mean to put b3 coin into the same category,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYtgVvSnz_A,but I will mention it because I've had several people comment saying I should look at it referring to the fact that it's so cheap right now at sweat 12 Satoshi this is still for just at least this is my personal opinion there's no financial advice not a financial adviser my personal opinion is that this coin is super expensive the fact that this 81 billion in supply and the market cap is 67 million dollars for not just another value transfer yeah I know it's got staking or whatever 67 million dollar market cap I'm not gonna buy it I think it's super expensive people thinking this is it's ranked 83 is it's gone up ranked 79 because people are thinking that's super cheap this activity here falling down slamming to the floor is likely because of the high inflation I put it off people been telling me about it for awhile I just got enough so I had to say something Bitcoin though oh oh oh Bitcoin yes yes Bitcoin seventy-two hundred ten percent in a day that's so insane,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

YYtgVvSnz_A,"but then Bitcoin started to pump and etherium it isn't very independent of bitcoins price at all really I think etherium for now struggles to grow when bitcoins growing at least significantly at least for now even though Bitcoin cash has lost eight percent in the last 24 hours if you look soom out a little bit last week it hit a peak of like how much was a peak getaway so Bitcoin casted a peak of like 2,400 very very briefly and while eight percent negative loss in a day seems like quite a lot it's actually been kind of stable around the thousand two thousand four hundred mark and it's been fluctuating within those parameters for a few days now rip are not so bothered about iota is on the rise on the rise it's not been this high for a little while who's almost at a dollar before dollar right there Liske is rampaging right now look at that growth since November second",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

Xzd3X79pjAo,"that's a little bit worrying so should you invest right now my personal opinion non financial advice is that dollar cost averaging is probably a good bet right now there are no guarantees every investment has some risks but assuming Bitcoin isn't going to test 6k again 5,800 again because the the worry is that if we are if we are to fall down below the support levels that we don't know where the next support level is but assuming we're not going to then fantastic time to invest so a few people I respect in the industry are quite big on wax so I'm definitely taking a look at this it's difficult for me to motivate myself to part with Bitcoin but definitely interested in this so onto the argument let me change this wallpaper I feel like a race through videos I really should make them longer yeah YouTube promotes you if you just blab along for a long time this blob little word alright I guess that'll do Bitcoin isn't backed by anything it's censorship resistant I get to keep control over my own money and it's covered by the laws of mathematics and not politicians okay",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

Xzd3X79pjAo,but doesn't the price fluctuate a lot like if 90% of the miners turned off their machines wouldn't it be a lot cheaper to make one true so on to me this why does Bitcoin need to be thousands of dollars per coin I think this is the biggest misunderstanding encrypted currency that it needs to be a high value it doesn't assumably that's not a word actually assuming that the the entire world accepts Bitcoin you can spend it everywhere it's stable at around a dollar per coin let's just say for argument's sake it would still work the point that so many people seem to miss is this how do we get there how does the whole world adopt something so niche as a cryptographic algorithm especially ten years ago when most people had never even heard the word cryptography incentivization literally no other way Bitcoin could have been designed with an unlimited supply but Satoshi and his vision decided to make it limited giving rise to scarcity so that they would become more and more desirable ideally we've seen failing economies in recent years Cyprus Greece Venezuela Turkey soon to be more there's certainly value in Bitcoin for these countries but if only Bitcoin could just be a little bit more stable you could argue that they could just use gold or something but fact that bitcoin is just more convenient you can send it around the world very quickly almost for free turn it back into Fiat quite easily if your government or bank isn't banning you from doing that so does this mean that Bitcoin meets your fundamentals of something you should invest in does it produce enough value for you this personal question for myself having had a deep mistrust in the banking sector for a long time for their abuse of their powers that led to the financial crisis just 10 years ago having wished for some way that we could take power back from them before I even heard,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

Xzd3X79pjAo,yes it does that's how I can be so hardcore with my belief in Bitcoin it's because my belief isn't backed by the promise of Fiat gains but rather the fundamental ideals and I'd like to end with this an article studies showing the over 60 percent of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have no working products or for example that there's only five million wallets for Bitcoin with over 100 USD in them if you believe that crypto has already hit mainstream adoption and it's failed then sell cut your bags cut loose but for anyone else sticking around we need to recognize that everything is still way in its infancy there is a long long way to go bitcoin is very unstable but that's just how currencies work currencies are traded against each other all the time and even the USD would be massively volatile if it had a market cap as low as Bitcoin when the market cap is in the trillions then Bitcoin can become stable then I believe it can become the new world reserve just like fear is backed by the belief of people accepting it so could something else if it has the backing of the people I really hope that day comes I would see that as a great achievement for Humanity it would ideally force financial elites to curb in some of their more dishonest practices but do you agree with me is that actually what is backing bit let me know your thoughts leave a like on this video if you enjoyed and I will see you again soon,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

L8A6wMrCwXc,and buy more I was a bit worried about making that intro actually if I'm honest because you know Bitcoin had just crossed 10k there was every chance it was gonna retrace to at least four but we all know what happened hold on something using cam what are you doing hey men what's a problem you like a few days late this wasn't even funny to begin with all right well what do you want how about wolf of wallstreet dub I got you I mean I gotta say it I mean I'm incredibly excited to hold ether I mean this seems like a great way to get rich quick hold it right there your only responsibility is to be humble you trade it before I watch YouTube and and I read a couple ta posts congratulations thank you name of the game move your money from the exchanges pocket into your own pocket,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

L8A6wMrCwXc,and I hadn't actually recorded anything so ends up getting creative and putting in a sound effect instead they get bigger than you can ever imagine so if you have the opportunity to invest in a revolution which is still in its infancy it's just getting started learning to a walk before Rick can run you don't risk your investment mind a trade and all because then you give you money to the whales now you use your head a subjecting black folio and all the time you hold on to it and remember that you can't time this market there will be Corrections as has always been its normal it needs to happen you just keep holding and I'll tell you why but because years from now these dips will mean nothing a thing of the past trust me on that you and me the holders we're taking home cold hard cash VR Lambos and Tesla roadsters it's incredible,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
L8A6wMrCwXc,Sam I can't tell you how excited I am it should be probably one of my finest intros it just speaks true you know lots of wisdom to be learnt there now then yesterday I put in some music that I had found on that was non copyrighted and bunchy you said that uh another youtuber uses it and then I stole it and I hate when people steal things from crypto youtubers because we're small channels so like you can steal from the big ones but the small ones I really don't think that's cool so I didn't know I I don't tend to watch a lot of cryptocurrency youtubers no offense to anyone at at all whatsoever but I apologized to him I won't use it again he was really cool about it why don't you all go and subs already set crypto I've watched a few of his videos today it's different from other people's I like that maybe we can help get him close to two hundred KS nearly there but that has been it from me thank you very much for watching leave a like if you enjoyed and I'll see you again soon [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
B5Dw5y7uKK8, I don't know don't forget to Like comment subscribe enable notification set channel this homepage hug vote on steam and refresh this page reviews still here ok let's make a video Bing my eyes you come in a little bit there we go no we're gonna look at three reasons today why there might be a pump in the markets for Bitcoin especially in November and December to be frank no one knows for sure but let's just jump in doom let's just jump and it's just jump into it reason number one the S&P 500 I feel like Trump does this a lot port initial State this creepy up with that down the American stock market exchange index based on the 500 largest companies is in a downward trend currently I know my audience is primarily international but what happens in the u.s. or China for example has a ripple effect on the rest of the investment world,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
B5Dw5y7uKK8,so it's still I think worthwhile to see what's going on historically autumn has been a bad time for the markets current technical indicators state it's a strong sell which probably means it's as strong buy but this isn't financial advice well many speculate all right what they're saying is that cryptocurrency could be a good safe haven from the markets or at least the hedging of their bets where the stock market is doing bad and people need to protect their money from the evils of inflation they move it over to say oh I don't know Bitcoin thanks Elon for the publicity I want to say this is likely I want to say it's gonna happen cuz it makes sense one day I believe it definitely could to be impartial though in previous market downturns this has not been the case in fact quite the opposite just using this dip as an example the worst of it being around October 10th,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
B5Dw5y7uKK8,what happened on Bitcoin on October 10th it would have helped if I'd prepared this beforehand on the day it was pretty quiet the day after bitcoins suffered it looks like a big drop about a three and a half percent drop so correlation causation make of it what you will the truth of it is previously if the stock markets didn't do well then cryptocurrency didn't do any better,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
B5Dw5y7uKK8,but maybe the future will be different moving on to reason number two this creepy triangles triangles everywhere [Music] triangles literally everywhere the squeeze look how much that line has been squeezed bullish or bearish it depends on who you ask the problem is while there is a lot of tools to help you out Fibonacci retracement lines intraday moving averages it depends where you draw the lines for the triangle no one can really agree what's going to happen bar some sort of move is coming soon ish what I'll say about it though personally is that volume is low so whatever people say people aren't selling bitcoin and people aren't buying Bitcoin at least not in droves one way or the other reason number three that's really difficult to do with your hands the savior of crypto the international exchange or ice and their trading platform backed a little bit confusing I know will officially launch December 12th pending regulatory approval but why is this a reason,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
B5Dw5y7uKK8,well oh well physically settled Bitcoin futures contracts where institutions could theoretically be trading hundreds if not more millions of dollars worth all of it backed up by an actual Bitcoin where they gonna get those bitcoins for the markets over trade counters whatever going to reduce supply amazing so juicy Wow hmm what  could be delivered against that well again I'm gonna try and be impartial here check this out October 12th so about a week and a half ago coinbase confirmed shutdown of crypto index fund project after assessing demand from retail accredited and institutional investors point base has decided to shut down coinbase index fund basically this is coin basis answer for institutional investors and they closed it down due to lack of demand I know it hurts like like a blow to the stomach maybe backs will be different maybe there will be huge demand let me know your thoughts I am curious like comment and sub it up I'll see you again real soon,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ygDoXFDmLlQ, so today then in the market we have pretty much every coin making records absolute records they are at their all times highs for this year today in the market we have Bitcoin not doing too much right now ripple slowed down a tiny bit in theory I'm not doing too much either neither a you lot all the way till about stellar a new number 10 had a fantastic weekend well done today's biggest gainers are as follows request network doing very well indeed ray blocks getting over that correction like it was nothing dragon Jane may get my finger in there doing pretty well as well rest of them he okay verge has been a bad boy lately no no no,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ygDoXFDmLlQ,no no verge didn't deliver on I promised develop her upgrade hello on a more serious note the market cap is hovering still between 600 a little bit lower a little bit higher while the Bitcoin dominance of that share is falling rapidly 37 percent now not rapidly but it's falling if it was going any faster it would cause a flash crash but it's going slow enough that it's not causing a crash in the market but even still though we apparently still on course for john mcafee x' 1 million dollar per Bitcoin bet by the end of 2020 or he'll eat his own genitalia according to this website it's still on target so that proves nothing at all,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ygDoXFDmLlQ,but I thought I'd share it you're welcome talking about the Bitcoin dominance falling there was a comment I thought that was worth sharing this is kind of how I feel as well Bitcoin is slow expensive and outdated but don't underestimate its ability to bounce back big money generally doesn't care about tech only profits and by all means support by wish i push an industry forward and a far more deserving to be on top but as far as investments go don't discount Bitcoin and I think that's is wise words for example the first Bitcoin lightning Network payment has been completed if this website will finally load we video here of someone paying for his phone bill in Bitcoin with no fee and it being instant nice very nice no I according to our BTC if you frequent there it's not nice it's not going to work time will tell if that's true yeah that's all well and I scripts are daily,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ygDoXFDmLlQ,but when can we start using lightning Network the word is soon soon you can use it with test net bitcoins right now there's not currently a date for it getting a widespread main net release even though this transaction was it was done on the main meaning it was done with real Bitcoin it was a real transaction you just need to be pretty technically savvy to be able to do it at the moment so we're getting there soon seems to be the phrase it this lighting network is gonna force more segmented option it might even possibly force a block size increase we'll have to see so the year of 2018 is looking pretty good for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general I mean it's only the first of the year hope you all had a nice New Year's Eve I'm sure many of you were thinking of your gains to be had this year you have life goals I think that's important and I genuinely hope you all achieve them for me today is the start of the year-long Hodel experiment,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ygDoXFDmLlQ,and I'm making other purchases my buddy Nikolas made this chart for me this is gonna start showing all of the coins Bitcoin etherion Bitcoin cash ripple like coin thousand dollars into all of those then some of the best smart contract platforms a DA eos neo cute um some of the privacy coins Manero verge z cash I'm not sure about vert it's getting a lot of bad press recently with developers not doing what they said they would many people call it a flat-out scam if you have suggestions on which other popular privacy coin I should do this experiment with please let me know the best Segway coins vert coin Moana coin Russell coin then we have just buying big Kinect tokens using the platform without referrals and using a platform with referrals you guys wanted to see it you voted it in didn't expect that I guess thanks are in order it's pretty weird,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ygDoXFDmLlQ,one we shall see what the average person needs to get if the Kinect does not pay out more than just holding Bitcoin does how many referrals does the average person need to get for it to be better than just holding Bitcoin we shall see what happens this month this year this week even I might do weekly updates put the short video out on a Sunday that I wouldn't have usually done so then we technically have daily content from me yeah okay hahaha daily yeah I get it same exact thing with hash flare one with referrals one without Bitcoin mining and I think that's it I was gonna do all of the Bitcoin Forks but it got really complicated and especially when there's already more on the way I think I've got enough to keep going for this year the rules are no selling we'll find out what is the best coin to hold this year out of the top popular ones I'm sure there's something gonna come out from left wing absolutely blow out its competition don't know that yet I'm just buying the big market cap ones big Kinect is launching an IC o----,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ygDoXFDmLlQ,apparently big connects X we literally know nothing about it there is nothing you see these things up here you click them they do nothing they move my face out of the way the only thing that we do know is it's a new coin don't even know if necessarily is a new lending platform I mean I guess it is but so here's a few things that gonna happen with this either a ton of people are going to get rich as it explodes in popularity or it's an exit scam as big connectors already on the way out and this is the last final cash grab or it's just another regular IC o---- and whatever one of those three probably who we almost went an entire episode without a tree I'm very sorry behold nature now you don't need to go outside today you're welcome,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4, welcome back to cryptos RS my name is Aaron and you're watching D5 Friday today I'd like to address the Ledger controversy regarding seed phrase splitting and recovery program so let's get on into it I want to jump right into the Ledger page here Ledger is a hardware wallet if you're not familiar Hardware wallet is going to make your crypto more secure especially when using applications on the on the blockchain so you can certainly send your crypto to your Ledger wallet your Hardware wallet in general or you can use it in conjunction with metamask and Robbie and what we like on this channel is the RX wallet today I'm going to talk about The Ledger controversy regarding seed phrase recovery I'm going to talk about Alternatives including a trezor and then I'm going to show you how to connect a trezor to your to your browser-based wallet so recently Ledger announced that they're going to be including a service for 9.99 a month,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4,and they would like to give you the chance as a new crypto user a new hardware wallet user to be able to recover your seed phrase now most of us that have been around for a while know the phrase not your keys not your coins right and this is the biggest concern for most crypto people crypto investors want to have full control over their assets at all times and not be able to give control to anyone else including the government hackers,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4,Etc right so the whole point of having a hardware wallet is to keep your keys safe and it keeps your keys on a hardware device that makes sure that every transaction that you do on the blockchain is verified only by you and can only be transacted by you using your Hardware wallet so the way I personally use my Hardware wallet is I've connected it to my browser-based wallet and every time I make a transaction I have to go through the process of approving that transaction on my Hardware wallet so the leading Hardware wallets are going to be able to do this for you there are many different browser and otherwise based wallets out there and almost all of them will work with either Ledger or trezor that I'm going to talk about soon here but I want to run through just some of the basics here I think especially in the D5 space it's important to have a hardware wallet in order to keep your uh your transaction safe I like to use a hardware wallet because it makes me feel safer every single transaction that I do has to be verified physically by me without my treasure dongle connected to my computer nobody can transact coins on or off my wallet without my consent because I have a hardwire wallet connected to it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4,so here are a couple of the options out there Ledger being the most controversial right now but I also want to talk about trezor trezor is my current favorite and something I've been using for a couple years and I want to talk about the pros and cons of both so Ledger was the one that brought the controversy they're going to charge you ten dollars a month to uh to hold your seed phrase among three different entities so it would break up shards of that key phrase and give it to three different entities and so if you needed to recover your seed phrase you could possibly do so so all these wallets don't have that service connected to them,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4,yet they did say recently that they're they're delaying this process they're delaying the service because of the backlash so it is currently not available on any of the ledgers but they could change it in firmware updates moving forward guys so a lot of people are moving away from Ledger and picking up things like trezor and other Hardware wallets well these are the current prices of The Ledger series of products I'm not going to personally recommend them as I've not used them and I think because of the possibility of firmware updates in the future including that Backup Service I don't recommend getting one but I do want to show you the comparisons of these though Ledger has delayed the seed phrase Recovery Service they will make it available on both the Nano X and the Nano S,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4,Plus I understand that they won't be including the server service on The Ledger Stacks one thing that I want to talk about is specifically with Ledger is that their software is actually closed Source anytime they include a firmware update it's not something that you can actually access and look into the codon so even if you understood how to read code you couldn't get into the code because it's closed Source now that is very much in contrast to trezor so trezor actually gives you the ability to look into the code so those who are able to read code can actually look in to the open source code that's included in firmware updates on Treasure in order to raise any red flags that may have been included trezor has a couple different products available as well they have the trezor model 1 and the Model T let me compare and contrast these models together so the trezor model one is going to be very similar to The Ledger Nano S one of the things I like to look at in these is the connectability,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4,so USBC is the connector on all of The Ledger devices but you could also connect via Bluetooth to your phone to your smartphone in order to make transactions and trezor has a very similar ability on the Model T so the model one is a hardware only USBC only connection where the Model T gives you the option to do either a USBC connection or a Bluetooth connection to your phone as well one thing that I don't personally like about that option to do Bluetooth is that it could possibly be used by somebody else very unlikely,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4,but it is a possibility because it's not a physical connection that somebody in the vicinity could connect to your Bluetooth device and be able to access your treasure or your Ledger however unlikely both Ledger and trezor have management applications where you can send different coins to your Ledger from different chains so I'm going to open up my treasure Suite here and this is where you can actually buy receive transfer all your coins and you can do this with Bitcoin you can do with this with ethereum and different chains guys so this is a great place to manage uh manage your funds if you don't want to do it on chain the biggest difference between Ledger and trezor for me is that the trezor software is open source and much more accessible more decentralized if you will in the the ethos of crypto being open source and a public Ledger guys I think it makes a lot more sense that trezor made their software open source which gives an extra layer of accountability to their product so setting something like this up is actually fairly secure,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4,and so I'd like to show you the process of doing so with my Rx wallet I'm going to open up my Rx wallet here and then I'm going to hit manage up in this right corner now if you're using metamask or rabi this is very very similar so following along with this should give you the ability to do that for other wallets as well so I'm going to add another wallet and then I'm going to choose import Hardware wallet if you're creating a new wallet you would start there but I'm going to import a hardware wallet because I've got my trezor connected with arox you have the ability to choose Ledger or trezor which are the top uh to Hardware while it's available,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Q61Zl-99_Q4,so I'm going to choose trezor because that's what I have connected every Hardware wallet comes with a set range of multiple ethereum addresses so we're going to export that list to RX now I'm going to type in my security code here when using a trezor on chain you're going to get this pop-up that requires you to enter your PIN whenever you're transact for extra security now I've got a standard Wallet not a hidden wallet so it doesn't need a passphrase you can set up a hidden wallet which will require a passphrase an extra layer of security for every transaction when setting up a trezor on a browser-based wallet you'll get this list of ethereum addresses to set up and I'm just going to choose the first one today and I'm going to choose import create a name for it and then import all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA, uh i but i i also think that you just have to recognize the history of it that it went ran up and then ran down uh it got too much money got too hot these days it seems like everyone is buying bitcoin and guess who just publicly declared they bought bitcoin yes that's right jim cramer host of mad money and a cmb's analyst he publicly declared he just bought some bitcoin today but he didn't do it on air he did it secretly during an interview with the street which he is part of so he mentioned it in the interview and he was asked some basic questions on why he decided to buy it now and why does he believe in bitcoin before i get into that i want you guys to take a look at this clip it's just a few minutes long take a look at it and then let's go through it together we did that this morning that you think that you'd buy some bitcoin but for investors you've been watching um some bitcoin this morning,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,yeah i just felt down back to 17 it was simply a decent level uh and uh i will buy like i usually do as something comes down i'll get bigger and bigger and bigger uh i just think that you want to diversify into all sorts of asset classes uh i have gold i want to diversify into into some bitcoin not a big position for me but it's certainly important to be diversified and bitcoin is an asset and i want to have a balance of assets i like this idea of it being an asset and you balance it out with your the rest of your portfolio but for investors who are watching this perhaps and they've been hesitant to make moves especially into bitcoin what's your advice for them and what kind of homework do they need to start doing before they even get the first time at pomp i was on his show from twitter uh i think that there's ample uh literature about there but outside about what it does uh i,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,but i also think that you just have to recognize the history of it that it went ran up and then ran down uh it got too much money got too hot so there's no reason not to wait for it to come down again uh why did i buy it here then well you know it's off nicely from the top and uh i i like to buy something that's off nicely from the top all right so you heard what jim cramer said and i couldn't stop laughing the whole time through it just seemed like jim was just so clueless and he wasn't prepared how to answer those very basic questions so let's look at it together and let's talk about it and get very excited about my next question and because it centers around bitcoin and you tweeted that this morning that you think that you'd buy some bitcoin but for investors you've been watching and they're headed um some bitcoin this morning,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,yeah i just felt down back to 17 it was simply a decent level uh and uh okay real quick so when asked why he bought bitcoin it you know what was the reason and he said well it felt like a good level at 17 okay that was the only i guess so so answer that he gave um he didn't really justify that at all other than yeah 17 seemed like a good level to buy let's continue i will buy like i usually do as something comes down i'll get bigger and bigger and bigger uh i just think that you want to diversify into all sorts of asset classes uh i have gold i want to diversify into into some bitcoin not a big position for me but it's certainly important to be diversified and bitcoin is an asset and i want to have a balance of assets okay so that was okay right so why did he buy bitcoin while he says he wants to have a diversified portfolio,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,and i think we all agreed to that we should have a diversified portfolio most people when they're looking to hedge against the valuation hedge against inflation hedge against uncertainty traditionally they would buy gold that's how it's been forever right but now we have another asset that people could buy that hedges against those things which is bitcoin so jim is saying well i'm gonna buy some bitcoin because i already have gold so why not right okay so let's move on to the second question and this is where he really stumbles i like this idea of it being an asset and you balance it out with your the rest of your portfolio but for investors who are watching this perhaps and they've been hesitant to make moves especially into bitcoin what's your advice for them and what kind of homework do they need to start doing before they even get the purpose by i was on his show from twitter uh i think that there's ample uh first of all it was really hard to hear he he said a pomp because i don't think he actually knew his whole name he's talking about pom poliano,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,right um someone that's pretty well known in the bitcoin industry he had a lot of debates with peter schiff and also other personalities um david portnoy and even jim cramer i mean he had a lot of interviews it's funny that jim just says okay a guy from twitter i think anthony pompeono is is more than that but i don't think jim really knows that or he's kind of flustered by it um but it's funny he mentions that right i think that was his response to her asking well how should new investor do homework um that doesn't really answer other than i think he's trying to say watch the interview maybe that's it but he didn't really answer that at all uh literature about there but outside about what it does uh i but i also think that you just have to recognize the history of it that it went ran up and then ran down uh it got too much money got too hot so there's no reason not to wait for it to come down again uh why did i buy it here then boy okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,so i don't know what kind of answer that is he's really graspy as straws right like he's trying to come up with something she was asking what new investors should do in terms of research homework and he doesn't give any of that he mentioned that he did an interview right i think he kind of mentioned that and then he's talking about how bitcoin goes up and down right and new investors should wait okay so then why did he buy it i mean that's not an answer at all he's really grasping right now it's off nicely from the top and uh i i like to buy something something i see from the top all right jimin with that we're gonna close out the week okay so he concluded that um that he likes to buy stuff from the top that's it he didn't give any fundamental reasons why he likes bitcoin basically he's buying bitcoin because he's full mowing in,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,right uh it's it's really fear of missing out because he's been hearing so much about it especially after the anthony pompliano interview that one is actually good i think pomp actually did a really good job explaining to jim kramer jim kramer did say that he was going to buy bitcoin afterwards but i don't think he really understood any of the things that he he mentioned which is kind of weird i mean a lot of the stuff that applies to bitcoin applies to gold right and jim should know about gold so he should talk about how it's a store value but also technology right there's a finite supply it's a non-sovereign uh currency that's not controlled by any government right um these are things that are very basic uh that jim should be talking about but instead he he didn't say any of those things he did didn't answer the question at all and that's why i was laughing the whole way through because it's really asking someone about bitcoin that really does not know anything about it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,and he simply bought because he fomo in he thought that yeah he needs to buy now before it goes up again and goes higher right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,i mean this is fomo at its best this whole interview was really about jim's concern about taking some profits he feels like the market is too high and he feels like people should take some off the table right don't be too greedy so the interview was really good talked about a lot of different stocks and companies and it was good until this bitcoin segment where jim just stumbled so badly even just just to mention a few tidbits just a few tidbits good things about bitcoin would be would be satisfying right or satisfactory i should say the only thing he said was well uh 17 seems like a good good level it's off from the top and that's it as i mentioned at the beginning of the stream everyone is buying bitcoin what a surprising turn of events in 2020 it's not the retail investors that's full mowing right now it's the institutions that are following in it seems like every week we're hearing about a brand new institution that has just declared they bought bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
I8cgRhNLzVA,we're hearing about institutions banks some big publicly traded companies also big personalities big billionaires investors the credit investors economists it doesn't matter who you turn to these days they're all talking about bitcoin and they're all publicly declaring they're buying bitcoin and that is very very different compared to 2017. so what are your thoughts about jim cramer declaring that he's buying bitcoin and what are your thoughts about his answers when he was asked about bitcoin leave your thoughts below thanks for watching hit the like and subscribe to the channel and stay tuned for my future videos bye,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HVkEnck2Vck, what is going on with decentralized finance aka d5 it seems like every single lender or project involved with d5 is skyrocketing it reminds me of the ico days from 2017. 2017 so is defy worth getting into or is it a bubble let's discuss first of all if you don't know what defy is quite simply think of it as projects that are trying to act like a bank so what does a bank do bank takes deposits and also bank gives out loans that's basically what decentralized finance means but obviously a little bit more complex these projects are based on the blockchain they're based on smart contracts and they're based on oracle's which i'm going to talk about in a little bit so what these companies do basically they take people's money or crypto in this case they lock them up and they give them very very high interest rates so that is a big advantage one of the reasons why people love defy think of your traditional bank account you put in money you get,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HVkEnck2Vck,point two percent interest apr like it's basically zero but with d5 you lock up say bitcoin or even a stable coin it could be as high as 10 percent in some cases even higher the interest rate is very very high and the reason for it is they don't invest like a traditional bank banks give you very little interest because what they're doing is taking your money investing with it and hoping that they make a return with defy on the flip side these companies are lending out crypto that's why they want you to lock in your crypto in the first place so there's people out there that pretty much want to play with fire they want to leverage they want to play with money they don't have so they put down collateral so in this case crypto and they borrow money or they borrow crypto against their collateral and then what do they do with that they use that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HVkEnck2Vck,and then they invest in more crypto that's basically how it works and what most people are utilizing d5 for so that's the brief explanation of what deep i is in a nutshell of course a little bit more complex than that but easiest way to think about these projects are that they're trying to act like banks and take a look at this website d5 pulse the total lock the value of all the crypto and basically every single d5 lending project out there is now at 4.6 billion dollars 4.6 billion if you go back a year that number was only around 494 let's just say 500 million so roughly one year it has went up tenfold that's just locked in value so people perceive locked in value as use right and network transaction is high so if you look at the top four lenders maker compound synthetic and ave they have been skyrocketing maker has always been high but it's also moving up take a look at their market cap maker is at close to 600 million ave which used to be athlete they're at 507 million in market cap and they have been skyrocketing recently synthetic which i'm not too familiar about this company but still they're in the device space lending space close to 400 million and compound is 445 million dollars so this is why it reminds me kind of like the ico days of 2017.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HVkEnck2Vck,basically any lending or any company that's involved with deep buy is really benefiting right now it's really skyrocketing there are risks so i don't think people understand what those risks are number one there are smart contract risks everything everything is handled through smart contracts even vitalik himself says that d5 users are underestimating smart contracts risk because there's always vulnerabilities with new patches new updates there's vulnerabilities you just don't quite know sometimes and there are a few d5 companies that were hacked so that's number one you do need to realize that when you don't control your own funds you don't control your own funds okay number two there are other risks involved in terms of getting liquidated due to market volatility maker went through this remember when bitcoin crashed 3800 ethereum flash crashed and the system didn't even have time to do appropriate liquidations basically almost everything was liquidated and auctions had to be held where they were selling um selling crypto for basically pennies on the dollar so there are risks involved with liquidation events as well if the system goes down or there's a flash crash volatility there's stuff to worry about,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HVkEnck2Vck,so so there are inherent risks and plus i already mentioned the people that are actually putting down the collateral to borrow um they're taking an extreme risk right they're they're playing with fire they're playing with money they don't have and unfortunately some people you know they want to risk that and that's up to them but i'm not for it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HVkEnck2Vck,and i don't think you guys should be for that either so with that said it's defy in a bubble and will it burst unfortunately i do think it's a bubble i do think that there's too many people that's getting involved too much enthusiasm and the way it's growing i definitely see that it is in a bubble but will this bubble burst anytime soon that's unknown since we're still early you know in terms of total locked up volume compared to the total market cap and the entire crypto space still relatively small so this could definitely continue forward for a lot longer and if you're feeling fomo you want to jump in be careful don't go all in don't fomo in and try to spread out your buys now besides lending projects they are doing well i mentioned oracles they're a necessity to these d5 projects and the biggest one has to be or i should say the only one has to be chain-link and chain-link is definitely on fire just yesterday i created a video talking about chain link and their explosive growth and yesterday uh chain link topped out around 13 80 and then went down to 12 look at it now it's at 14 18,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HVkEnck2Vck,and it was even higher earlier today chain link is just on a roll now recently you can see there's a big gap here recently chain link shot up due to a massive short squeeze and that's because there's a company called zeus capital that is spreading a lot of fun they publicly uh shorted chain link and they were liquidated we're talking about tens of millions of dollars liquidated that all went to link and pumped it even higher the irony is they actually borrow money on ave,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HVkEnck2Vck,and then use that to short chain link that's the irony here but chain link is going up because of that short squeeze and plus there's so many people that is really excited about d5 and d5 really relies on smart contracts and oracles for their execution so that is another reason why chain link is skyrocketing and it doesn't seem like this is going to stop anytime soon and today for the first time ever on coinbase and on binance that chain links trading volume exceeded bitcoins think about that think about how difficult it is for that to happen and that happened today that's how many people that are actually involved with chain link and trading and it's not just channeling either there's another project it's very similar to chain link probably one of their biggest competitors is also skyrocketing people are already looking at the next chain link i'm gonna do some research and talk about them next week so bottom line is any company that's involved with d5 right now is really really benefiting at this point all right that's it for this video what do you guys think do you like d5 are you utilizing already leave your thoughts below thanks for watching hit the like and subscribe to the channel and stay tuned to my next video take care you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Bm4UKKrRvC0, welcome back to cryptozaurus i am george merry christmas or should i say merry bitcoin christmas because bitcoin just formed another all-time high this morning bitcoin went up as high as 24 600. bitcoin has broken the temporary resistance around 24 2 000 and looks like it wants to head higher so in this video i just want to look at bitcoin and see what's going on and predict where it can go later today and this weekend all right so bitcoin is sitting at 24 216 and that is fantastic and that's because the temporary resistance that bitcoin is facing is 24 200 and that is this green line so if i zoom out a little bit yes there's a lot of lines but you can see that 24 200 is the mark that bitcoin needs to break and right now it did break it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Bm4UKKrRvC0,and it's holding above or at least trying to so i think that is the most important thing we need to see is whether or not bitcoin can actually hold above this line so going back a week you can see bitcoin tried to break through it many many times and and bitcoin wasn't until until this morning so take a look at this pump this morning this christmas pump uh bitcoin pretty much went from 24 000 all the way up to 24 650 ish and it looked like it was doing good it was hovering but obviously some whales or people uh wanted to take some profits or drive things lower so it did fall below right and you could see that actually held right at this trend line that's uh that seems to be pretty consistent at this point right and then now it's climbing up climbing up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Bm4UKKrRvC0,and it really you know the bears and bulls are kind of fighting this 24 2000 mark so this this reminds me of the 195 mark remember in 1905 bitcoin couldn't break above for so long when i say so long relatively speaking actually it wasn't that long about a month or so but right now we're seeing the same thing with 24 200 of course the timeline is much shorter but if bitcoin can hold above 24 200 that would be very very very encouraging now i did want to show you guys a couple things number one is volume volume is actually quite low quite low so if i uh zoom out a little bit here you could see that volume over here enormous right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Bm4UKKrRvC0,and then you can see volume just slowly decreasing so with volume being lighter what does that mean that means there is going to be volatility so what we're seeing now is perfectly natural we could definitely see it move up really quick we can see more pumps later today and this weekend and we could possibly see more retracement too that is why we're seeing stuff like this going on right now one last thing i want to show you guys is this trend line this orange line i drew out and it shows that the the low keeps getting higher and higher and higher and higher and all the way up until yesterday it was pretty consistent and this morning boom it broke out of it but even uh you know like an hour ago when bitcoin retraced and fell down a little bit guess what look at the bottom wick right it hit that trend line almost perfectly so this trend line is moving up and bitcoin is following this pretty consistently so even if bitcoin just goes up and down up and down up and down up and down and holds and it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Bm4UKKrRvC0,you know it's teetering uh at this 24.2 mark right if it continues this might be the point where it breaks out right so it could go sideways a little bit before it starts breaking out and if that's the case that's that's tomorrow okay so that means we may see this whole day just up and down up and up and down and then boom tomorrow you know the weekend we could see a breakout so that could be a possibility so i just want to show you guys that real quick so lastly work in bitcoin head well this is anyone's guess right now but but seeing how the last jump bitcoin experience was about 4 000 points we're talking about 195 to 24 000 right so a little bit over 4 000 so i'm thinking if bitcoin does the same thing and then it does spike up and pumps up we could see another four and maybe this time 5 000 point jump before settling down once again,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Bm4UKKrRvC0,so what does that mean if bitcoin jumps up 4 000 that means 28 000 is right around the corner and if it goes up another thousand let's say 5 000 then we're seeing 29 000. like i said before after 20 000 you know it's anyone's guess right now but seeing how after we broke through 19-5 bitcoin spiked up tremendously we're talking about four thousand forty-five hundred you know we could see the same thing we could see all this happen right away right at this point at 24 2 and if we break up next stop could be right around 28 000 29 000 and that could be right around the corner that could start as soon as tomorrow now besides bitcoin some all coins are doing good today but for the most part they're still kind of struggling right now against bitcoin bitcoin dominance still at 68.5 percent so that's how you could tell all coins aren't really catching up but there are some movers for example xrp is up from their lows uh the recent lows and also litecoin is up pretty significantly others like bitcoin cash and chain links some others are recovering,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Bm4UKKrRvC0,but uh if you look at a seven day performance very very very little has outperformed bitcoin litecoin is one of them that is outperforming bitcoin i mentioned that one of the videos i produced recently right i do think litecoin has a good chance to outperform bitcoin short term but all the other all coins right now is still kind of struggling and the one that everyone is talking about right now is xrp i know that you guys are wondering if xrp is a good pickup right it fell down as low as 22 cents recently before coming back up a little bit so people are wondering if this is a good time to buy in my opinion no and that's because there's still a lot of uncertainty at this point moneygram one of the biggest partners of ripple has come out they released a press statement saying that they basically don't use ripple net they don't use xrp,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Bm4UKKrRvC0,they don't use ripple net they use other services but they're trying to distance themselves away from ripple and that's not a good look and there are still rumors about coinbase and others thinking about the listing xrp and if that happens if coinbase comes out and says they're going to de-list xrp that is go cause a massive dump and all the other exchanges will look at xrp in the same light and probably delist it as well so there's too much uncertainty right now i still think it's best to wait it out i would not be getting into xrp because i think the recent rise with xrp is just because it's a dead cap bounce it it felt too hard too fast but i don't think it's over yet i think there's just it's best to just wait it out at this point as for all the other all coins it's the same things just waiting game,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Bm4UKKrRvC0,right right now we're waiting for some money to flow out of bitcoin into these all coins but with all the momentum and hype and enthusiasm and money flowing to bitcoin you know when is that stopping point right when does bitcoin take a a long breather where the money flows into all coins that's unknown at this point at this point we all know bitcoin is going to go much higher fomo among institutions and retail investors keep growing but short term as long as bitcoin can hold at 24 200 and utilize it as a new support that would be very very very positive and bitcoin can build upon that and go much higher so merry christmas leave your thoughts in the comments below and if you are new to the channel make sure you hit that subscribe button give me a thumbs up and check out these other videos if you haven't already you,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
dInqu3p7J0o, what is going on with xrp ever since 2018 it has been making lower highs and lower lows it has been going down down down down but something has changed recently look at the last month performance xrp is up 89 since july 2nd to where it is now over 31 cents something bullish happened and in this video i'm gonna explain what [Music] [Applause],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dInqu3p7J0o,[Music] now it wasn't until a few days ago where i really caught what xrp was doing in fact i even tweeted out and joked what's up with xrp moving 24 today how much more to go before 589 dollars now the 589 if you're not aware of that reference that's because there was a video that was created years ago that talked about how xrp has unlimited potential all the banks are gonna move towards it and if they do the ceiling could be at 589 dollars so that's where it came from now looking at a few articles here's one that talks about xrp being up 30 recently and how it has 30 new whales so of course people are studying xrp studying the blockchain looking at addresses and people are realizing well there's a lot of new whales that's coming in out of the blue but why though why now one of the reasons why xrp has been held back since 2018 is this a lawsuit this is a big one so there's two plaintiffs that's suing ripple and brad garlinghouse and basically saying that ripple conducted an unauthorized security sale which is a big no-no now these two people basically lost a lot of money in xrp and they're mad so they took ripple and brad garland house to court and they've been in this lawsuit for years now claiming that ripple sold xrp as a security not as a utility and brad garland house profited handsomely off the sale of xrp,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dInqu3p7J0o,well guess what now we're finally coming to a conclusion to these lawsuits according this article that was just posted not too long ago u.s court dismisses claims against xrp the northern california district court finds that claims against ripple labs and its token made by two investors cannot be proven what this is saying is xrp is ruled not as a security token and whatever that was sold was not a unauthorized or legal token sale with this ruling i think this is very positive for ripple i mean this has been something that's been holding them back for years upon years upon years and with this lifted i think it now finally has a chance to continue higher now of course some of you guys may be looking at this chart and saying well this is still horrific chart right since 2018 and it's been coming down down down down,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dInqu3p7J0o,right you could see that the lower highs is basically following this trend line but because of its recent actions and because of this lawsuit being dismissed you could see that clearly it has broken above kind of like bitcoin where it has broken above one of its previous hard resistances and now it's looking to move higher the caveat is it hasn't broken through a recent all-time high which was back in february of 2020 and that was around 34 cents so xrp has not approached that yet but once it does we'll see what happens if it could break above that would be very positive for xrp so this could be the turning point for xrp finally i know some of you guys are still xrp fans some of you guys may have jumped on the bandwagon because it has been really really difficult to hold xrp throughout the last two years when it has basically done no recoveries at all there's been no none no recovery it has been going down down down down but with this lifted this could be the start of something great,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
dInqu3p7J0o,so what do you think can xrp finally move forward and go higher or is it more the same and this will continue to go lower and lower and lower leave your thoughts in the comments below thanks for watching hit the like and subscribe to the channel make sure you follow me on twitter and stay tuned for my next video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Tw4ot68cVzA, if you're wondering what is going on today well here's four reasons why bitcoin and all coins took a dive today starting with bitcoin it's hovering around ten thousand seven hundred dollars it dip a little bit below around ten thousand five hundred now it's crawling back but overall it's down six percent,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Tw4ot68cVzA,and it's not just bitcoin if you look at the rest of the all coins everything has fallen down just as much if not more what's impressive though is btc dominance did not really fly up normally on big down days like today bdc dominance would fly up because people sell off their all coins and bring it back to bitcoin but not today everything is selling off roughly the same now a few days ago i mentioned about how there's a phenomenon with bitcoin how every tuesday for the last four weeks bitcoin would fall and it happened this week too now tuesday morning bitcoin did go up but at night it was pretty obvious that bitcoin was coming down and after that wednesday and today we saw bitcoin fall even more however if you go back the last four weekends most of these big dips that you see happened on a tuesday there are four reasons why i want to talk about because today's drop is obviously a little bit more drastic than some of the ones that we've seen in the last few weeks number one the broader market is down look at market watch dow is down nearly 900 points which isn't so bad three percent but look at smp down three point seven percent and look at nasdaq the tech sector down a full five percent so the broader market definitely has effect on bitcoin as much as we like to see bitcoin basically decouple itself from the stock market it hasn't really because we know a lot of investors they're invested in both and when they panic on one they tend to panic on another,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Tw4ot68cVzA,and i think number one the broader market today is having effect on crypto overall now why did the stock market go down today that's the million dollar question that i haven't been able to figure out but the one that makes the most sense is because it's just been too overbought it's been going up and up and up and up especially tech stock basically this recession uh has turned into a golden opportunity for stocks and they have been pumping so today could just be a normal correction day we will see tomorrow and next week number two is a d5 cooling off not that much the total locked in value is still nearing 9 billion but this morning and last night it was a little bit higher now the problem with d5 right now is there's too many people trying to run pump and dumps now pump and dumps happen all the time in a crypto sphere but with d5 it's happening a lot more often and a lot more people are getting burned by it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Tw4ot68cVzA,so this could also be one of the reasons why the overall market is is down today look at this article and look at these names hot dog and kimchi coins flash million percent yields and this relates to the very popular yield farming which a lot of people still don't get i don't get 100 but there are people that are just utilizing this not so much to make money but just to run pump and dumps and guess what one of these hot dog coins uh yeah it dumped 99 in the open market it went from four thousand dollars to one dollar in five minutes so if you thought today's five percent drop six percent drop with bitcoins bad imagine losing 99.9 within five minutes yes this is what's happening right now and unfortunately there are known players that are promoting this and look at arthur hayes he's one of them he's one of the biggest ones he's the ceo of bit max which is questionable already they're they're going to be doing kyc pretty soon,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Tw4ot68cVzA,so i don't know if he's trying to to make up for that or what if you look at his twitter he keeps talking about you know pump pumping these d5 projects like you're in finance i think a lot of people give him the credit in terms of pumping up yearn because he wanted to see at a hundred thousand and if you look through the rest he's pumping up a lot more this d5 project which he really does not care about so there's a lot of there's a lot of fomo and and hype um surrounding defy and i think it's getting dangerous it's dangerous i i've recently talked about d5 in a positive manner but the way some of these people and characters are are utilizing it you know doing shady things behind the scenes and manipulating the market with these new created tokens and with yield farming uh it's not looking good,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Tw4ot68cVzA,it's not looking good hopefully this does die down and the characters get burned and most people just kind of get away from this because if this continues it's really just go ruin defy all together number three is there's a theory going around that uh the miners are taking advantage and selling off a little bit because we haven't heard about the miners recently when things are really bad when bitcoin is really low people talk about the profitability of miners and you know during those times sometimes they have to sell off or shut off operations because they're just not profitable but since bitcoin has been going up you know we haven't heard much about it so according to this article there's an influx of btc into exchanges and usually when this happens you know why because whoever is putting into the exchange is trying to sell it so this could be from the miners they're simply taking some profits or they're selling off to pay for operations it doesn't mean that they're about to quit,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Tw4ot68cVzA,but it could mean that maybe they're starting to sell off because bitcoin has been stagnant for a while so even though the price is high it's stagnant the difficulty though keeps adjusting and it keeps adjusting up and up and up like it has been the profitability for miners may have been dropping lower and lower and and gotten to a point where it's it's break even or unprofitable once again so the fourth reason could be due to tron and it's hard to imagine but look at it if you scroll down tron number nine it went up 41 today 41 that's a big climb so i decided to check out justin's twitter and he tweeted us two hours ago and he's bragging about 222 million of trading done on just swap and what is just swap just swap is just like maker but for uh for tron's network basically it's for lending you could put down you can put down collateral and there's a cdp and and basically you borrow in this new token called usdj and you can do whatever you want with it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Tw4ot68cVzA,right so are people now moving from d5 like the d5 on ethereum moving to d5 on tron maybe maybe and also tron has been going up because i think a lot of people are excited about the sun network so there's that so there are things going for for tron but um i i don't know i find it hard to believe that on day like today where everything is going down tron goes up 41 so there's something going on there that i can't put my finger on but i think this may be another reason why there's a broader sell-off maybe this didn't cause it but it's contributing to it i don't know where this is going to lead these are the four reasons why the market went down today it could have been caused by any one of these or a combination of all four now am i worried,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Tw4ot68cVzA,no i want to see where this goes i think this is a natural correction that we will see a bottom find the bottom and continue back up everything i've talked about for the last few weeks i don't think just goes out the window because of a few days the fundamentals keeps getting better the technicals the usage the adoption you know widespread fears inflation and how that's helping bitcoin all these things all these things didn't just go away for the last few days so for me i'm gonna take the opportunity to buy the dips so i'm gonna watch bitcoin carefully and watch some of these all coins and see where they go and when they do bottom out i'll be taking advantage but what about you will you be taking advantage or do you think this is the start of the next doomsday drop if you are interested i do plan on putting out another video on my vlog channel where i'm gonna discuss my investments with bitcoin and crypto and stocks and and some of the other things that i put money into just like a broader video and my perspective of it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

ANgnWlNbQjg,it's a great dive into what might be ahead of us number 8 Enron the smartest guys in the room now for those that don't know Enron was one of the largest US corporations at the time and this one exposes the corruption and business practices fraudulent accounting methods that took place that led to one of the biggest collapses in US history these company was valued at 63 billion dollars at the time number seven quants The Alchemist of Wall Street so for those that don't know quants are the mathematicians and computer scientists that do a lot of the behind-the-scenes work these days of financial institutions so this is a look at all the products the financial derivatives that were designed that almost led to crashing the financial system the JFC they also dive into high-frequency trading algorithms and how less and less of the actual volume that takes place now is people genuinely trading more and more is becoming just computer driven number six and this is a new one only out this year 2018 dirty money it's a six part series that looks at business scandals and corporate corruption now my favorite as a pharmacist was episode three the drug shot where they dive into Big Pharma prioritizing profits over patients number five global financial meltdown and this is one of the best financial documentaries out there as it says in the title it's a four part that's actually uploaded in in one long video on YouTube with two million views now so it dives into the greed and recklessness that led to the GFC all that easy lending practices you know no money down loans London verse New York both fighting to be the banking capital of the world at the time and everything that really led to the GFC number four how the economic machine works with Ray Dalio this one's got over five million views on YouTube now it's a fantastic thirty minute animated presentation breaking down how the economic machine works as the title says everything he's learned in his career about what you're taught versus how the world actually works with interest rates debt business cycles it's a fantastic easy to watch short film number three zeitgeist now this one is a three-part series the first which came out in 2007 episode two is the most popular with over four-and-a-half million views on YouTube this was a non-for-profit film created to question how the world works from all angles and different industries their message is that often and the majority of us go through life without really ever questioning how things work and it can actually be very different to what we're taught in schools and universities part two dives into the know the causes of this and part three dives into the solution so what we can do to make the world a better place number two inside job now inside job was a an award-winning from 2010 they won the Oscar for Best Documentary what brought about the financial crisis interviews with people on both sides they asked some hard-hitting questions to those that were in the wrong and it's interesting to watch them you know squirm and just lie through their teeth to Congress a fantastic watch that really exposes some of the bad guys that won't admit they're wrong no matter what and number one hidden secrets of money with Mike Maloney now this is an eight part series episode four is the most popular with over seven million views this is all free to watch on YouTube this dives into the history of money itself history of banks how money is created all the way through the latest episode episode 8 which is about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency so this is probably the easiest one to send someone to that knows nothing about the world of Finance and banks it really has some great animations that lays it out all out Mike does a great job he's long been a proponent of sound money gold and silver and he's also very interested now in Bitcoin in crypto currency,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ANgnWlNbQjg,so I hope you've enjoyed my top ten list guys as I said there's plenty more good ones out there look forward to reading those in the comments below please hit that like button share these videos around subscribe if you haven't already and as always thanks for tuning in guys cheeeeese,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M, hi guys thanks for tuning in to another episode of Novak's news in this video I'll walk you through our recent trip to Melbourne plenty of meetings with some interesting startups government-backed initiatives exchanges incubators this is a sort of thing that we see behind the scenes every day and it gives us strong conviction that the blockchain space is just going to explode in the coming years so 10 meetings in under 10 minutes let's dive in and have a look what an average day looks like for us,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,so I'm up at 5 a.m. to catch an early flight over to Melbourne to meet up with James who's head of business development big hearty breakfast I love Melbourne the coffee culture smashed avocado whatever floats your boat that big breakfast before a big day of meetings so first meeting we had was with larium now these guys are doing accounting software for the blockchain and a lot of these really good software as a service companies recognize that they don't really need a token or an ICO and it's great to have these conversations with them about maybe going down the path of a security token offering now to offer equity in the company but these guys with plenty of experience in their industries we want to have them on the channel and talk to them about the experience they've had with developing blockchain solutions and trying to pitch it to some of these people where their face just glazes over and then never heard of blockchain and so on so interesting companies we're gonna have a lot of these guests on the channel in the future next up we met up with Paul McNamara's an all old friend of mine he's run plenty of businesses he mentors people like Tim Payne captain of the Australian cricket team his wife Katie works at IBM and they've definitely got a big block change strategy that they're working on so great person to talk to all about business development personal development we're always striving to be better and provide a better experience for you guys as well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,so I always love catching up with people that are more experienced than you need to pass on that that wisdom next up we've got country and other exchange that has been around for a while now they've recently partnered with the company and they want to break into that space of allowing you to pay bills and so on as well but all these exchanges are coming to us and saying what do users want how can we provide a better experience it's so saturated now with the exchanges and that's gonna be great for you guys in the next 12 to 18 months as all these exchanges look to add more features and give you a better user experience so we look forward to doing more educational stuff with country and plenty of other exchanges as well next up time for a lunch break again you can head out in Melbourne and get some awesome food at just about any little alleyway he go down these days and I prefer to have lunch with these clients that we met I'd much rather have a coffee a meal or a beer and get to know people a sort of how a lot of Asian business is done but maybe not in Australia where everyone's wearing their shirt and ties obviously we're not ones for that getup I'll be wrapping my crypto shirt,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,but it's always great to talk to these people in a more casual environment so helio are a lending company and we'll have them on the channel we're gonna try and get you guys a great deal to break into this lending space to unlock the value of your crypto there's some estimates that Ozzy's own 20 billion dollars worth of crypto now if they can start to lend against those assets because at the moment if I walk into a bank they don't recognize my crypto I can't borrow against that now if you can borrow against your crypto you know you can start to unlock capital it doesn't lock in a taxable event you know with buying and selling so there's all sorts of wonderful things that happen once we can start to borrow against our crypto as I said we'll have these guys on the channel soon because salt lending and earthly and they haven't really broken into the countries like Australia just yet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,and it's those licensing arrangements that we're gonna start to see in the next 12 months next up we're off to RMIT these guys were doing some awesome research macro stuff how is blockchain gonna disrupt entire industries social movements and so on so that research was fascinating we're gonna have them on the channel soon,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,but they work with some of these Australian startups that are trying to disrupt these industries agriculture voting and so on you guys know who I'm talking about and it's great to see all the way from this big-picture research down to the individual projects that these guys are sort of collaborating next up we've got concrete so this was a interesting style up trying to fractionalize ownership of housing there's plenty of projects doing this in Australia and I'll like cover them all at some stage but working with collective campus which is another incubator in Melbourne that have developed hundreds of startups and they're starting to see some very exciting blockchain startups that want to go down the path of security token offerings that leads us to our next point where we headed down to stone and chalk this is a huge sort of incubator shared workspace in Melbourne the blockchain Center have just moved their name and now based there as well and this is where we held our security tokens event now we always have a sort of early get-together for our members in our premium section to get to know them anyone in our members group knows that it's like family so getting to have a beer and a feed and get to know the guys in person he's always fantastic and then the public rolls up we had about 150 maybe 200 people by the end of the night to talk about security tokens now Rick clink has just come back from Malta where he's setting up the Malta exchange for security tokens other people there you might know John he's working with regulation and familiar with a sea call that side of things Jason from them and they're developing those mosaics to really make it easy for people to create their own projects and tokens and crash from Caleb and brown,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,so it's been a pretty big day at this stage go home get some dumplings eating the hotel room that's always fun but then always try and do extra videos for our members in our premium service every night as well so we've got hundreds of extra videos and when I'm on tour I love to check in every night and let members know what's been happening so the next day we're off to Gary Vee now if you don't know Gary Vee I recommend checking out some of his work about social media and disruption and the power that influencers are going to have the move away from you know TV and traditional media and website advertising is going to be very disruptive so that was a full day of speakers we went out for lunch it was Ben's 20th birthday so so for those of you that don't know Ben a very smart guy high school dropout and I think you know you hear these stories about those people that dropped out of high school so too smart and had good ideas,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,so Ben's in charge of sort of social media and a few other aspects of nuggets news I used to say is the smartest teenager I know but now he's 20 so happy birthday Ben then we're back to Gary Vaynerchuk there was some good speakers that afternoon and I like his theory about the clouds in the dirt so in crypto it's no different people talk about Lambos and getting rich but the dirty stuff is the hard work and the research for us it's you know running our group and doing all the reading and so to bring you the best content in the news so everyone wants the flashy stuff no I wants to get down and dirty he's all about teaching people how to make small income and doing jobs that other people don't want to do being creative leveraging social media and we're certainly obviously trying to do that with our business ran into Troy from crypto for blokes there which is great,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,I know a lot of you guys are big fans of Troy and what he does for the community as well so always good to put a face to the name to all these people that we only ever mean online and then we're out for dinner with our friends from Calvin Brown so the most of you have used Calvin brown I've always had a great user experience for buying and selling crypto,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,but again they want to branch out they want to bring in the next wave of people so high net worth individuals that know nothing can ring up the phone and learn how to buy how to store it safely a bit of Education and we want to work with people like this to build these courses and really get the next wave of people in there so big supporters of the channel shout out to Calvin Brown we had a great dinner they took Ben out for his birthday Mexican and then a nice whiskey bar as well next up in the morning we were going out for breakfast with the CEO of blockchain Australia Bitcoin in Australia Adam who is now the director for digital transformation in Tasmania Adrian who is the CEO of hobby in Australia so all these people want to get their next wave of innovation innovation but public awareness how do we lobby government how do we change tax laws if they're in a probe how do we get better conditions for startups keep innovation here get public awareness and people into crypto and realizing that Bitcoin isn't this big scary thing you know a scam or so on so it's great to get smart minds together I love those little meetings I can't say too much,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,just yet but there's certainly going to be a lot happening in this space next up we're over to Kenya a project that was one of the earliest to ICO in Australia and bear token prices taking a bit of a beating but solve a lot of projects they've got a working product and it's these projects that survive the bear market that have a working product that are going to do well in the future and there's estimates that the freelance economy is going to be anywhere from 20% of 50% of the workforce and a lot of these companies you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qntIHEXxG7M,TaskRabbit whatever maybe take a 20% fee for finding your job so if we can make this task economy gig economy peer-to-peer with you know only 1% fees on the platform that's gonna be huge going forward so I've got that Minimum Viable Product they're going to continue to build that out and we will have the can you guys on the channel again in the future so a pretty hectic tour as I tweeted I think he I do love the city and going to all these meetings but get me back to Tasmania that fresh air and tranquility where I find that I can be far more creative and less stressed with the content production side of things so I hope you've enjoyed that video guys something different today I look behind the scenes let me know what you think in the comments below smash that like button subscribe if you haven't already share these videos around and thanks for tuning in guys Cheers,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M, hi guys thanks for tuning in to another episode of Nuggets news in this video I want to cover another exciting project and that's exec ROC now ROC token stands for run lots of computers and that's because these guys are creating a marketplace for blockchain based decentralized cloud computing now this is a fascinating industry I've covered Gollum a number of times on the channel I'll talk about other competitors at the end of this presentation but it really was a pleasure researching this project and the cutting-edge technology that they're using for this cloud computing so reinventing cloud computing the next generation we know that the etherium blockchain is enable the development of all these decentralized applications now the problem being that etherium and a lot of block teams in their current form are inefficient at storing and computing large amounts of information it can be very expensive,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,so what I exactly is trying to do is take a lot of that computation off chain to complement this ecosystem of applications and working the background to distribute the computing now they are planning on being blockchain agnostic in the future so named neo any of these platform based crypto currencies we can move the computation off chain,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,so what is cloud computing now you've heard this term a lot no doubt the easiest way I can describe it is if you've got a website or any online business as it scales you need more and more computers or service to process all the information you might not have the capital to afford those computers or you might not have the physical storage space to store them so you're outsourcing the computing power to other people that have no dedicated servers they've got the infrastructure you know all I've got these data bases it's stored somewhere else you use it when you need it it's easier for your own website or online business application whatever it may be to scale so all these different devices are talking to this information that's stored or processed somewhere else now this falls into three main categories so you might have heard these terms software as a service so outsourcing the software or outsourcing these platforms but outsourcing the infrastructure is the one which a lot of projects are trying to disrupt this industry I guess,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,and I exact is exception here they're really focusing on building applications in this marketplace but also creating a computing marketplace for all the infrastructure to be bought and sold on between users that have those computers sitting there they're not being utilized so it's fantastic everyday people will be able to sell their computing power so currently we know those you know web Giants that dominate this industry Amazon Web Services Microsoft Azure IBM in Google it's very centralized it's expensive this is another industry that's going to benefit greatly from blockchain technology but known only that but the security of having that distributed ledger technology rather than the legacy infrastructure so powering application so obviously the focus and what everyone talks about is the high performance computing side of things but this is there's so much more to this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,so you know think Internet of Things think all these different applications that are completely decentralized I'll talk about that marketplace you know Apple you have to jump through so many hoops to get listed on these app marketplaces so this is a decentralized app marketplace itself folk computing and edge computing was something else I've found very interesting which reading about today so obviously you know we're outsourcing to the cloud but that's not always efficient if we've got Internet of Things lots of little devices it's not it's not efficient to outsource that information and that processing to a cloud so some computing and some storage can be done closer to the actual network itself where we need it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,and then we can outsource other things so whatever's more cost efficient and that was pretty interesting stuff to read about there we've spoken out 3d rendering and other computational intensive sort of processes that this is perfect for and a lot of these other things we've spoken about a number of times in the channel big data being a hot commodity ai been a growing industry as well so let's check out the team now I look through some of their histories here some of the guys have literally been working on solving this problem of distributing computing power since the year 2000 so you know nearly 20 years now these guys have finally sort of found that solution through blockchain technology smart contracts computing power itself has got exponentially better so this is the sort of marriage of all those things I've been working on a researching for a number of years the founders and then obviously the team's grown recently into over 20 members there as they're saying hackers marketers top-notch team here and it really is a good quality team here guys considering their stage of development how quickly this has all come along as well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,so I've got some fantastic partners I know something to talk about along the white paper is you know environmental factors as we continue to need more and more computing power in the future so check out some of their partners there I'll dive into some of the awards I've won as well but they're definitely building a good network of partners and apps so here's their current app store so I think it's over 20 apps here they plan to have 50 apps on this by the end of next month as well and that's what builds this community in this network real world applications and people using this technology so all these apps are being run in a decentralized fashion in the version one of this technology that they currently have running I've won a few prizes recently here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,so they did win this award at the digital hearing awards top 100 in Europe they took this event home as the leading startup with the most promising new business model that was only yesterday and only today they've announced a partnership with Ubisoft so this is being part of the Ubisoft startup accelerator program one of four companies chosen to work closely with Ubisoft for the next few months,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,so no doubt that will greatly benefit them as well now at the top of the page here back to the star their roadmap so they've been around since 2016 I've already got some good partnerships here as I've mentioned some of the good apps that have joined early but they're iceo was the 5th largest at the time raising twelve million dollars it sold out in three hours and since then similar to Golan I've really gone behind the scenes to work hard so that version 1 was released and this was think of it as quite centralized so it had a number of companies running those servers trusted entities to distribute the computing power to that was version one but version 2 is being released at the end of next month and that will be the first ever decentralized cloud marketplace for computing power so pretty exciting stuff and then there's obviously further iterations and developments down the line as well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,but this decentralized marketplace where anyone can sell their computing power is gonna be launched at the end of May so that's why I wanted to cover this project today I think it is flying under the radar so this industry itself it's a no-brainer guys we live in this digital age we've not spoken on the channel number of times about the number of apps Internet of Things all this computing power that's exponentially growing it's all around us this is a multi-billion billion dollar industry controlled you know in the hands of a few they only need to capture a tiny percent of market share to become a significant player in this space and they've already developing those partnerships check out the white paper it's only 31 pages a good read as I said is very interesting to go with this stuff today with a fine-tooth comb keep an eye on their reddit this community is very small another reason I think this is flying under the radar and you can see there that at the time they had the fifth largest ICO in history you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,and now it's just a small community on their socials as well so all those little things I look at when picking things that haven't been hard yet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
SLZ_3bdyO2M,so competitors I've mentioned Gollum a number of times on the channel sign em there's daddy elf so a lot of these are doing similar themes but the go-to-market strategy I guess is the biggest difference here with AI exec where they're really focusing on these apps and building that community rather than gamma go near the path of doing that you know worldwide supercomputer for all that high computational processing was these guys are going down focusing on the apps first and then focusing on that computation in the future I hope you've enjoyed this presentation guys I think this is a fantastic application of blockchain technology they're solving a real-world problem they're disrupting a very centralized industry in its current form I look forward to that market place being rolled out next month let me know what you think but that DLC token is the see this ecosystem which everyone will be buying and selling their computing power with I hope you've enjoyed this presentation guys please like subscribe if you haven't already share these videos around and as always thanks for tuning in guys Cheers,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw, foreign [Music] what is going on ladies and gentlemen welcome I am the crypto Crow and you know what I'm going to do a video today that I just really I just don't do I don't do gaming videos very often If Ever I think I may have done a couple in my entire life uh one of them was like magic the Gathering Arena way back in the day and I'm so addicted to this game again and I say again because this game and you're seeing my uh one of my characters I have five by the way I have five characters that I'm playing in this game that I'm leveling up uh right now and you know first let me preface this video a bit so I have been completely stressed uh and I've been hiding it pretty well but I've been ultimately pretty stressed about what's been going on in the market what's been going on in the world the potential Wars in this war and and how just all of it has been driving me kind of mad and I try reading I try painting I try doing a lot of different things,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,and I just I needed something to really dive into that was deep that was convoluted that was full of of mystery and information and data and options and and just I just kind of like a like an Eve online but for but in a medieval world right before all of this other garbage started they had their own problems obviously but anyway back in the late 90s I played a game called Ultima Online now before you click away before you go oh God I don't want to do that game that that game is so old I'm telling you right now you're gonna make a huge mistake if you've never played Ultima Online let me tell you something there is a um yes this is my character he's leveling up magic right now so there's a free server that I absolutely highly encourage you to try out it's called outlands and before I get even into any of that you know I'm not going to show a lot of gameplay video right now because it's not really what this video is about what I am going to be showing you is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,I'm going to give you a taste of some of the options so if we look at this game uh this is a list of all the skills in the game okay there are I don't even know how many there are uh maybe a hundred I'm not quite sure but there are a lot this game is the most customizable configurable build game out there I don't know of anything better and there's a reason why so many people come back to Ultima Online decades after it was originally launched number one because it keeps getting bigger and better number two because the community does not die the Ultima Online Community has been going strong all these years since like 1998.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,why is that because there's no game out there there's no MMO I don't even care if you're talking World of Warcraft I don't care if you're talking e uh Eve online Eve online's pretty pretty Eve online is very comparable but it's in space and probably a hell of a lot more complicated um but this is very complex there's no other game on the market that basically offers you the ability to customize your builds exactly the way you want you want to be a tailor you can be a tailor you want to be a blacksmith you can be a blacksmith you want to be a backstabbing Shadow hiding poison uh dagger wielding assassin you can do that you want to be a grand Wizard and you can do that you want to be a necromancer you can do that anything that you can come up with you could probably figure out how to build that build in this game because it gives you all the tools to do it and I can't stress it enough I've been I've been sucked in so deep into this game my only regret I actually did I emailed broadsword which is the development company that took Eve online or um Ultima Online over and has continued to push it um and I basically sent them an email saying hey you know you guys should consider putting this on the blockchain and and building kind of an nft Market out of some of it even if it was a separate version but I'm not even playing the broadsword third one I'm playing the outlands version,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,so I'm going to show you their their website first real quick um so this is the outlands website and well this is their Wiki so if you go to the website let's just go to their website first this is the main website at outlands.com you got to check it out you click play now and you can download the client and when you have the client you can be you can play three characters at a time if you want so you can triple box like I am and and level your characters at the same time now if you played the original Ultima Online I will tell you this there are some differences but very much for the better number one they're continuing to build the world in outlands okay the maps keep getting bigger there they offer the number of houses I'm going to show you the number of houses that you can get in this game insane so anyway when you first start off you're given kind of a care package okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,depending on what initial skills you choose at character creation and that care package could be um you know it could be a little room that offers you like 500 spell casts for free without having to use Regents or anything basically all the things that you need to get your primary skills leveled up a bit right and you start off in this place called shelter which is ultimately it's an island and you can't kill other players on the island you can't do anything bad on that island okay it's solely for getting you started learning the some of the systems learning the skills picking out what skills you want to level because there's only you can only have up to like a 700 skill points and so that would either be taking a hundred skills or seven skills to 100 points maximum and then there's a whole other level to that so even after the skills are leveled there are aspects there are um the Mastery change there's all these other ways to then continue customizing the way your character operates,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,okay now when you download the game you start off in shelter and then there's even a dungeon and it gives you um skill point bonuses for kills for whatever it is you want to do and then once you get to level 80 on the island you go and you pick a Mainland right and it's all connected through Moon Gates and things but you pick a Mainland and from there you can level your skills up further and and and and that's honestly the way the way to go I I basically I started off on shelter with all my characters I leveled everything up um you can even spend money on shelter or gold so if you're like farming or mining or whatever and you're making gold um you can spend that gold to get all of your initial skills up to level 50 before you even go and start actively trying to grind out any leveling the other thing to this is there's a website called razor scripts this website provides you scripts that you'll use because when you download the outlands client you get I don't even know if you'll be to see it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,I don't think you can um but yeah you're not going to be able to see it um oh well oops I just closed out all my stuff uh so you're not so anyway there's a little application that runs in the background and when you run this application you can set up new scripts these scripts are like macros they do the same things over and over and over and they can get as complex as you want them to be um but ultimately that's that's what they are they're there to help you kind of power level your character without having to click click click click click click click and it can be passive so often you can run these scripts to power level your character skills while you're doing other things so you can be playing the game but Power leveling uh majory um you can be you could be doing anything right and so and this this will show you like here's these are all the crafting scripts train Alchemy using the Shelf tinkering crafting a tinker builds bombs and things like that which is what one of my,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,I'm building a um a thief but he also has a he's going to be a master tinkerer and this tinkerer will be able to create bombs and if I'm snooping in your backpack you're out there killing a bunch of stuff I can sneak a bomb into your backpack and you're like oh I didn't see this loot you open it you blow up I can take all your shiznit [Laughter] it's just it's just funny and I watch videos of people doing it and it I'm telling you anything you can come up with you can do in this game which makes it so wildly addictive so anyway the other side is to let's say you just you've got more money than time like some of us you can donate to the development team because it doesn't cost you anything to play the game you can donate and it's one dollar for every dollar you donate you're gonna get one pre-valia coin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,and so if you donated like 100 bucks which I've done a couple times um then you can sell these coins and if for every hundred it'll net you like 1.7 million 1.8 million gold uh roughly when you sell them to other players and you do that through the Discord the Discord Community is huge and there's a Marketplace in there there's all kinds I'm telling you folks I'm telling you if you get into this game and you get hooked like I have I'm gonna be right here with you uh I'm gonna if if enough of you are like oh dude I tried the game and it's crazy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,here's the thing you have to look past the graphics because I look at the graphics as a graphical style not an outdated game because there's a lot of stuff that you can do through customizing your homes like you can have your own ships in this game and there's like ship combat and like there's and every element of this game is so detailed and there's so many different options and so much to learn this is just everything I'm scrolling through is just how ships work and what you can do with them on them about them it's still going um and this guy I'm gonna show you his YouTube channel because I watch so many of his videos while I'm doing this this is like the witcher's guide the treasure map she would be a treasure hunter where you travel all over the maps all over the globe and you're digging up treasure chests and then you get attacked by moms to monsters and you get all kinds of rare loot and things like that I think that's insanely cool the the the monsters um the the mobs in this game there are so so many uh this is just a through c,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,d i mean that's just that's just a through D okay you got the whole alphabet there's so many monsters creatures all over the world housing the number of housing models in this game now there used to only be a small handful now I'm pretty sure there's like a hundred different housing models that you could choose from ranging from anything here's the thing the housing market here is ridiculous okay I'll tell you that it's like New York skyrise prices because the community is thick there's only one server and the way I mean they do lotteries so if a house decomposes or whatever somebody doesn't visit it in like so long it'll go away and then it goes up as a lottery so you can buy lottery tickets to win a house it's already placed some of these houses are worth 30 40 million gold okay so the housing market is insane the real real estate market is insane,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,but there's a whole system and there's even a tool that you can use so that when you're running around the world you can use this tool and look for spots to place the floor plan that's what this is you can kind of see it um it's looking for a place to place a home a building or something like that which is very difficult to do because it's very very busy but it's possible you can still find places where you don't have to spend uh 40 million gold to place to buy a house from another player you can just buy the deed for like a few hundred thousand gold and then go place it yourself if you find a spot so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,and that's what it looks like when you basically find a clear spot I'm telling you guys right now there's 12 minutes I don't want to do a long video I just want to give you an introduction to the game and let you know that I am absolutely I'm doing this video because I'm absolutely grateful for this game because I'm not able to play my War Machine my tabletop game right now I haven't been able to play that in a long time I'm very very picky about the games I spend my time in uh and and I am I'm just learning I'm I have literally been watching videos I've been watching this guy uh pawn star gaming there's something about this dude he's like cute but serious and fun and funny and kind of entertaining but really informative I do wish his videos were a little longer he does these really short videos and I end up watching him multiple times and then I kind of have to go back and look up other things but at least he does really good he does a really good job of pointing you in the right direction,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,but there's stuff that I I found confusing like the aspects and like you know he'll say well you need this and this and that but but not necessarily where to get them you know so I'm like okay well I know what I mean but I have no idea where I'm getting instead of animal job by making it like how so I do wish his videos were a little longer and a little bit more detailed um but they're still very very helpful especially his build videos,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,you know he'll like poison necro I'm building a poison necro because of this video of his um there's so many different build videos and there are a lot of other the Mage Tamer if you want to tame creatures and have creatures like big monsters all kinds of stuff you can tame them get their loyalty and then send them out to fight for you almost like a necromancer but with animal life um there are just so many different levels to this game folks I can't explain it I can't I can't there's no exaggerating that it's absolutely a very very deep and complex game that I'm grateful for because it's been really helping me keep my mind on things other than the hellish craziness that's going on in the world around us today and and it's just a cool break and it's something that you can do passively when you don't have time or you're busy with other things you run your Macros you let your Macros and things run your character you don't you know they support it the developers of this server support it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,it's free you don't have to spend any money you can and it will definitely help you save a lot of time if you do but um and I'm sure and it helps support the developers of This Server which is probably one of the longest lasting servers I've seen with such a strong and budding Community I've I've received so much help um it's there's a lot of PVP in the game you can get player killed and have your stuff looted okay but there are things that you can do to protect your most important items and things so that you never lose those uh there's so much to it let me know in the comments below if you check it out out if you learn about the game and if you really like it I'm more than happy to do some tutorial videos as I continue to learn in a completely different playlist I know it's not crypto based maybe I'll do them on Crow's Nest or something like that if you guys want um,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
nNPK3yjEavw,but I really really do encourage you guys to check the game out just go download it play it for a weekend see if you like it and then hit the wiki and just go learn as much as you can um I I probably don't you I played this game religiously back in the late 90s and it has changed so much with so many new additions and so much being added to it that I'm probably 20 into learning uh everything that this game has to offer and I sure as hell haven't done 10 yet uh probably I haven't even done five percent of it yet and I'm hooked I love it check it out outlands.com see in game I'm gonna try I'm probably gonna kill you in the game though just so you know curl your coins I'll see you soon,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts, foreign [Music] ladies and gentlemen welcome I am the crypto Crow make sure you check out murder of crows dot IO and pick up a couple nfts for fun uh you can men up to 10 at a time if you're so inclined and there are people basically buying these every day so at some point they will be sold out and then we'll see what happens but uh I love the idea of the murder of crows the the flock of birds spreading throughout the world I love it I just think it's great and honestly it's a great message it's a great sentiment and it just goes to show that you support me and what I try to do here on YouTube so anyway we're going to take a look at chat GPT joins the crypto hype sets the Bitcoin price at three hundred thousand dollars by 2030.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts,this is actually pretty interesting so pay attention because what is I mean I have been diving into uh our alternate or um uh artificial intelligence now for a while I've been using mid-journey almost daily experimenting with the new versions and it seems like a new more powerful version comes out every few months now and the same is true with chat GPT this Powerhouse of a system that and I haven't even dove in to chat GPT uh to the point where I'm like fluent or anything yet but I'm I'm going to and not only that I'm actually working on um a video where I want to do a full-blown guide on utilizing artificial intelligence chat GPT and online marketing to create a brand uh of for like digital art digital products and print on demand products and I know there's a lot of that stuff out there but every anyone I watch gives you a little bit a little bit a little bit I want to put it all into one powerful video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts,and I'm gonna do it myself and uh because I don't really want to do a video about it if I can't prove profitability for um but artificial intelligence is such a powerful thing and we can see that the algorithms of these AI Bots are obviously programmed with like political bents and and some bias and things like that but in the general scheme of things you know they're pretty smart and and they're they're able to do things that I've never seen before so there may be very well be some True to this I don't know how the information is pulled I don't know how the stuff is established within the algorithm of an AI system but it sounds pretty accurate to me after after Venture capitalists and former CTO at cryptocurrency trading platform coinbase Balaji survazen srinivas I have no idea made a shocking claim that Bitcoin could reach the price of one million dollars in the following three months many in the crypto Community became intrigued wondering if his prediction could fully materialize I'm sure you can hear that buzzing because for whatever reason the landscapers have decided to come out and start doing the lawn as I'm doing videos as the guesswork continued in Mass some analysts have turned to open ai's text-based artificial intelligence platform chat GPT for suggestions so the finbold team decided to give it a shot as well and the result the results were indeed bullish although far from the million dollar touted by some individuals three hundred thousand dollars in the cards as always upon being asked to offer hypothetical average Bitcoin price predictions for each year in the 2024-2030 period chat GPT warned it was only an AI language model and as such could not predict future Bitcoin prices with certainty or accuracy accuracy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts,but It ultimately did manage to deliver some interesting rounded up numbers according to the figures provided by the AI tool Bitcoin is expected to reach the price of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in 2024 that's just next year adding around twenty five thousand dollars every following year until it's speculatively it's a very enticing number of three hundred thousand dollars in twenty thirty as per the query posted on March 29th and you can see the data here as an AI language model I cannot predict future Bitcoin prices with certainty or accuracy and then it gives these numbers 2024 150 000 2025 175 2026 200 000.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts,and I am very curious I wish I wish somebody would ask Chad DP chat GPT how it concludes this data like where does it pull the information from how is this calculated because obviously there's some sort of calculation going on there's there's reference material there's uh there's data somewhere being pulled to establish these predictions now the thing of it is as we know Bitcoin runs on a four year cycle we're all very familiar with the four-year cycle is this saying that come 22 24 we break away from that cycle and we just start an elongated bull Trend where we obviously have significant Ebbs and flows within that that Trend,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts,But ultimately it's a Perpetual cycle all the way through 2030 and if that's the case why is it the the mainstream adoption is it the is it government regulations that you know is somehow going to come clamping down on the majority of altcoins ultimately pushing up the value of maybe a top five or a top ten in the cryptocurrency space for their various use cases and functionality to kind of beat the regulatory changes that are all obviously coming like what does this mean those are the questions that I always ask myself and what I I Ponder on a regular basis because I do believe we're going to be in a point where Bitcoin is the Grand Puba okay I actually have a book I think it's actually downstairs I'm pretty sure it's at my bathtub it's mastering Bitcoin uh Bitcoin lightning Network I haven't even cracked it yet because I've been doing a bunch of other reading and things,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts,but I want to learn more about the Bitcoin lightning Network and how that layer 2 is going to provide functionality to increase the performance of like micro transactions on the Bitcoin Network and all that and because I do believe that like bitcoin's here to stay regardless and I do think that it's going to be utilized for significant purchases and transfers of value you know you're going to buy a house with Bitcoin you're gonna buy a car with Bitcoin you're gonna buy major purchases with Bitcoin and then there's going to be select number of altcoins that are going to be kind of like the quarters to the dollar so to speak cardano I believe is very much going to be one of them and and I think those are going to be more um more focused around microtransactions on on a large scale likely given the way card Toronto is being developed with its governance structure,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts,and it's it's more autonomous kind of Ideal way that it's being developed so that the public and the community runs that blockchain based off of voting and a real democracy I can see that a lot of that uh transpires and into uh or transforms into you know a global use case for finance for gaming for a lot of things and uh and and so I I really believe that ultimately it's probably going to be like a Bitcoin ethereum a cardano and then maybe a couple others maybe an xrp maybe something else and then these are going to be the the primaries of of blockchain technology and if that does happen and a lot of the other tokens out there are regulated out of the space and I'm not saying I want this to happen necessarily just that I see I'm very curious to see what happens on April 18th with Gary Gensler and and you know what kind of answer because you know what I've never seen Gary Gensler uh before uh talk and I mean he's a smart guy like he's not,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts,and you know the thing of it is too is he doesn't come off to me as somebody Shady like I I mean and I I maybe I'm naive I don't know and I see a lot of the narratives that are being put out there by everyone all the time about Gary Gensler in the SEC and all of that but I just watched his meeting with Congress where he's looking for Capital to like you know continue his regulation uh but nothing about him came off as cocky or arrogant really or um or like like shady in the sense that he was having to defend himself all the time like it just felt very casual in the sense but professional and I don't know man I I could be completely wrong and you know but I watch a lot of these hearings with people and a lot of these hearings I feel like these people are shady man and they're always trying to cover tracks and they're always dodging this and dodging that I just didn't see a lot of that and I'm not trying to kiss Carrie's ass I just call it how I see it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
4kBxSzSK2Ts,but I am curious to see what happens on April 18th when he's when when it is maybe more of a hot seat kind of hearing where they're like hey why are you doing this why are you doing that this isn't constitutional this isn't law this isn't this this is that so I am curious so we're gonna find out come April 18th uh and maybe we'll get a better perspective on what's to be expected in the overall cryptocurrency space moving forward and how that will ultimately affect bitcoin's price I could definitely see us doing a blow off top above a hundred thousand dollars and probably in 2025 um maybe by the end of 2024 I don't know we're not even close yet so a lot of my metrics and indicators aren't even going to start lining up for a while but we'll wait and see until the then I'll see you guys soon Crow your coins,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,and it's based off of epochs and things and Mining cycle But ultimately it's about every four years and typically when this happens that's when a bull market starts because now bitcoin's incoming supply is cut in half while demand continues to rise with fomo institutional investing and things of that nature and while Bitcoin Rises and typically Peaks though as Bitcoin Rises and Falls Rises and Falls yes even through a bull run even in a bull run we see 20 sometimes even 40 pullbacks on a bull run okay and and that's generally all before it gets really parabolic and you know we're seeing some similarities to the 2017 cycle uh more than we are the 2019 cycle which was substantial growth all at once maybe that happens this time maybe it doesn't so we're kind of averaging it out now if we look at where we are in the cycle right now for cardano this is about uh this is about where we're at okay so we're very we're very close to like June 17th,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,the price had bottomed it's come up a little bit and it started to it's it's down a little but from its peak it's much I mean it's doing pretty well okay um and so when we when we look at the price action and where we're at we've got about um I think it was something to the effect of a little over uh about a little less than a year rather sorry so if we see if this is this bottom line here is where we're at okay so if we take this and then we go 365 days this is just past the having and I and I did this for a reason so we're basically going to say if we were to average in from about now which is where we are in the general pricing cycle in the current market and we were to average in all this time through the next having for a total of 365 days what does that look like and the thing of it is is this isn't necessarily um you know obviously the pricing is much different now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,right so back here you know the price was around five cents uh at this point here it was at about eight cents and it continued to drop down even further we got some new lows we were down to like a penny at one point but the thing with this is where we are in the market a lot of people are thinking well cardano's sitting at around 36 Cents it made it the bottom is in the bottom was back back when it was around 24 25 events and and there are a lot of people that believe that but we still have over almost a year to go until the next having and anything can happen and we can see here the cardano's price did drop even further given where we're at in the current macro Market where everything is kind of like hell in a hand basket right what's happening with the dollar what's happening with all of these other countries forming their own you know currencies,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,and I mean there's so much stuff happening and the the value of the dollar can continue to drop which I'm sure it will through inflation and while we're trying to offset that inflation it doesn't necessarily mean that the dollar is going to come up in value okay it's likely going to drop as it has I mean since 2020 the value of the dollar has not done well nothing in the economy has done well I don't care what anybody's trying to fool you with it's just the way it has been um so now let's go to the current current market all right so this reflects exactly what I'm talking about in terms of where we are uh in relation to like the next having now this is just directly to the next having this is 327 bars from the current market if we were to pull this out to uh you know about 365 days to give us a full year we're going just past the next having which is this green line here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,so what does this look like if we were to average in starting today and you can see how similar this looks to that previous cycle I mean it's pretty much identical okay here's the bottom we rose up I mean it's very similar okay what you can also say though is that the um the the volatility is much less significant in this market because you know honestly there's a lot more going on with cardano today than there was back then so the price volatility may not be as as you know ebb and flow all right so if we were to start averaging and what does that look like so I basically created this this is um DCA hyphen cc.com this is a cardano uh DCA calculator to basically let you know what you would have if you average did so much a day so much a week so much a month and I've already done a calculation based off of this period that I'm going to show you but basically I put um five dollars let me see if I can zoom out uh I mean,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,I can but it's not necessarily the the framing of this site is not that great especially for trying to show what I'm doing at one point it was doing pretty well but then it I don't know it resized or I don't know but anyway so I've got five dollars a day ultimately is what I have in here and then I started it from 6 17 20 to well it should be 2019. um so yeah okay so it's 6 17 2019 is where it started and it went 365 days basically to 617 2020. and in that time period starting from the very first date in the chart all the way 365 day days later we got an average price of five cents okay I know the price is much higher right now that's okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,that's not the point but in that 365-day period we invested a total of 1830 that's it we invested eighteen hundred and thirty dollars over the course of one full year starting at basically where we're at now in the same Market what did that now and this and and as you noticed I stopped it just after the having because if you don't want to average in us the price is continuing to go up post tabbing while that's entirely up to you you can you're probably still going to do well but that's not what this video is about this video is about showing what getting into the market right now could potentially mean by the peak of this Market all right so and and if you think about it if you look at the price action this this green line is the um is the having this red line is approximately where I see the peak having a being right so from the having alone you're looking at another um 490 days,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,so over a year from the time of the having so we've got two years at least I mean we've got two years until likely the next peak of the market all right so you're basically investing for a year and then you're sitting and waiting and keep in mind this doesn't this DC CA doesn't count take into account staking rewards Because by the time all is said and done when you've when as you're averaging in you're also generating a staking yield if you're staking it to like the crow node or any other node for that matter that's doing as consistent yield it's been around a while you're going to generate roughly four and a half percent annual and you're gonna get basically that much back in your cardano based off of what's in your wallet so you're looking at eighteen hundred and thirty dollars and then from there you know we've got the calculation here I took that eighteen hundred and thirty dollars worth of cardano which equated to around thirty six thousand six hundred cardano all right I took the 1830 at an average price of five cents,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,and then that gave me 36 600 Ada and then I multiplied that by the previous Market Peak which was three dollars and fourteen cents so your average price basically got you 36 600 Ada over the course of that year you held on to it through the rest of that market the Ebbs and flows of the bull market you made a hundred and almost a hundred and fifteen thousand dollars minus your cost which Was Eighteen Thirty multiply that as many times as you want over okay and that's honestly that's the gist of it now obviously the numbers are going to be different here because you're starting at around 36 Cents maybe the price continues to go down further before it starts to come back up that's okay that's what averaging in is when I started averaging in I started my averaging in process at about 50 cents as you can see it's down to 36 Cents it's gone even a little bit lower and I bought you know a pretty decent sum of that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,so and if it goes into the 20s I'm going to continue averaging and further but the thing of it is is we could always be wrong that's why we average in we average in because we want to get into the market to start things off it doesn't necessarily matter where we start in the market as long as we're consistent with it that's why people say buy the dip buy the dips because they're averaging their position down depending on where they bought it originally okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gUVR6AzMtqI,and then once and if you do start to average into cardano over this time period and why cardano because cardano to me is my number one it's my number one holding I've been following it since 2017 and against all of these other tokens out there the 20 something thousand tokens in crypto space cardano's really one of the few that has been tried tested many many many a times has proven all the futters all the haters all the competing blockchains and their big budgets and buying advertisements buying flood against cardano trying to hold it down so they can continue to rise up and basically make their profit from their uh multi-million dollar investments into their POS andomics uh genomic schemes um and and really tried to hold cardano back,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

qDmwBAjwRSc, foreign [Music] greetings ladies and gentlemen I am the crypto Crow today we're going to be talking about hedera hashgraphed and the hedera network and this is a project that has a pretty sizable Community okay granite and the technology behind its blockchain is very unique to what we what we typically see in the blockchain space the way that their their Ledger system is distributed and the overall architecture is quite a bit different and I know that there are a lot of people out there that believe in its use case but the problem to me with hedera hashcraft is I discovered it you know years ago and the price of the project just never seemed to grow significantly as it relates to the price action of a lot of the other leading cryptocurrencies in the like even the top 100 market cap and and I don't even remember where hedera hashcraft was or if it was even in the top 100 at the time honestly,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qDmwBAjwRSc,but I just know that there were a lot of much better performers in the space and I think some of that is obviously just due to the overall adoption of the of an era on a public scale now there's some evidence to show that there are some pretty significant Partnerships with hedera hashgraph and a lot of other projects uh and major traditional companies in the world for a variety of different use cases of which they may be basically bubbling up under the scene before they just explode all over everybody's faces sometime in 2024-25 as the parabolic Run begins and that everybody realizes hey I didn't get into hedera now I want to and you're buying at highs waiting for the market to correct after the peak which is typically the case with a lot of stuff um so I don't know exactly what's the comfort for hedera I've done some videos on it in the past,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
qDmwBAjwRSc,but we're going to take a look at some current news breaking hedera Network experiences technical irregularities Community alleges exploit in brief the hedera network is undergoing an exploit in smart contracts many dapps are impacted so these decentralized applications are being impacted and the tvl and the blockchain dropped by nearly 25 percent this isn't good hedera Network faces an ongoing exploit targeting the decompiling process in smart contracts The decentralized Exchange Dax saucer swap Labs has asked users to withdraw their liquidity this is not a good thing not not at all saucer swap Labs a Dax on the hedera network encourage users to withdraw the liquidity immediately as an alleged ongoing exploit hit the blockchain but you know what I will say at least officer swap Labs is trying to protect everybody instead of keeping it quiet um you know too often we see people that just they're so worried about accountability and they're so worried about uh you know people coming after them because an error was made or a mistake happened or something that cost people money and then they tried to hide from it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qDmwBAjwRSc,and they try to lie about it well saucer swabs at least is saying hey there's a problem get your liquidity off of here until we get this resolved and at least I respect them for that which actually helps me kind of build some trust and for that I'm going to give them a follow right now because that's actually commendable eighteen thousand followers on saucer swaps saucer swap Labs I'm going to take a look at them later an ongoing exploit has hit the hedera network this morning this exploit is targeting the decompiling process and smart contracts at time of writing attackers have hit Pangolin and heli swap pools containing wrapped assets we are unsure if it if other HCS tokens are at risk too so it's not necessarily hitting saucer swap apparently but it's hitting others and they're saying listen until we man that is actually that's commendable um so good on them for for being proactive and trying to protect its users I mean because ultimately they're gonna they're gonna take a hit,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qDmwBAjwRSc,I mean if they have an application out there and people are they're telling everybody hey pull your assets off of here we don't want it because there might be an issue until we know what it is we don't really got we don't want you guys risking your assets on our platform and you know that that good on them the decompiling uh process converts the contracts byte code into more readable solidity like code allowing for a better understanding um you know good on them for actually coming out and getting ahead of things and and but basically saying listen we're not sure what's going on you might want to pull your assets off of here uh so yeah I feel pretty good about that hopefully that gets resolved this doesn't necessarily kill hedera hashgraph,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qDmwBAjwRSc,it's just just there's an obvious issue an obvious exploit that needs to be addressed and you know we see this time and time again do we not when it comes to the cryptocurrency space and everything going on in the market on a regular basis we're always seeing exploits hacks we're saying like Solana you know constantly it seems nowadays just going down and shutting down and having to reboot itself and all kinds of stuff and then in the same token we see people complain about how long cardano takes to develop or reach new milestones in their development when they have teams of hundreds of people building this stuff out and they're trying to build it in such a way where they don't have issues like this they're taking their time to Market and every time they bring a new Milestone to Market it actually works and that is a beautiful thing to anybody looking to build especially Enterprise level applications with potentially Global use cases um you can't you can't throw a lot of this stuff on a crap blockchain,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
qDmwBAjwRSc,um that was just basically thrown together to be first to Market and then decides to patch any holes later you have to you have to go about it with the right approach and often oftentimes we can see listen if the scientific approach is good for you know creating medicines and other things that can basically help or hurt human lives I think that same approach with peer review studies and things like that should also be pretty beneficial to anybody risking assets on a blockchain so you know listen I'm not saying I I am down on hedera hashgraph but I'm just saying you know security audits are a real thing and it's something that every major blockchain needs to have and continue to have ongoing especially as they're updating applications they're updating their blockchains and things so uh hopefully hedera and they figure out exactly what this is and when when they discover it I'll be sure to share that as well and then until in the meantime Crow your coins and I'll see you soon,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY, okay so now we're going to talk about hot wallets specifically we're going to give some examples of different hot wallets that you may or may not want to try out uh there are some that I've found to be better than others some are more multifunctional than others some have built-in uh token swaps some are multi-chain wallets that you know basically they support a variety of different blockchains and are you know there's a lot so we're gonna we're gonna start with uh the three primary ones for me ultimately that I've that I've kind of grown to like over the years um the very first one actually let's get to the the easiest one which is metamask now I'm gonna say up front I don't particularly like metabask though it is easiest to use it's one of the easier wallets it is a browser-based hot wallet there are there's a lot of functionality to it but since ethereum 2.0 merge there's some other issues associated with it that I won't necessarily get in right now that's not vital But ultimately these are it's a plug-in that you download for your browser,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY,and then it will operate from within your browser,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY,and I will show you setting those up I will show you setting these up at in individual videos but for now I'm just going to go over what's available um it's there are a lot of different platforms like defy applications there are a lot of different things that ultimately plug into your metamask with your permission you have to click approve on these transactions and things however there's a lot of scammy stuff associated with these wallets not from the wallets themselves but with the way scammers and hackers get can get access to these hot wallets because by clicking some different links that you might find either through phishing or otherwise it could potentially open up ports and and vulnerabilities in some of these things and typically metamask being one of the biggest erc20 wallets out there especially the biggest hot wallet out there uh they're always working on patching things another thing that you want to look for when you're looking for these wallets is that you want to make sure you're getting the right address because and you never ever ever want to click ads like if you Google you know crypto hot wallet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY,and you see an ad for metamask you don't click those because generally those are hack those are you know and Google Facebook YouTube they're all super slow at removing bad stuff uh I mean I should say I mean if it's political they'll get rid of it immediately but if it's like a hack or if it's you know something that's nefarious and affecting a lot of users tens of thousands of users and stealing their money it could be a while until anybody lifts a finger I don't know why it's the case but we've we've found that that's why they just stopped at one point they started making it really difficult to even buy advertising and that's a whole other topic but to be on point here madamask is a good wallet but it is definitely something you want to be very careful when you use and that is primarily for um ethereum and there are other blockchains like binance smart chain and things like that that will function on metamask,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY,but it gets a little more Technical and that's not something we're going to go over right now because I don't see you using any of that in the short term now this is Nami wallet which is for cardano specifically uh it's very very similar to metamask but it's for the cardano blockchain and the cardano ecosystem uh I use Nan uh Nami uh for like play funds and things that I'm experimenting with uh definitely not my my main wallet at all I I won't even say everything that I do for for my the main bulk of my stuff but it's definitely not Nami but it is a good wallet and it makes things easy and it basically functions in very much the same way as as metamask now for you um I would probably guess that Exodus may very well be one of the easiest wallets with the most functionality uh and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY,and and one that supports multiple blockchains so manage in exchange 255 plus cryptos and and nfts on your web browser mobile desktop and Hardware wallets get Exodus now uh there's so much functionality associated with Exodus it is absolutely a beautiful interface it is probably my favorite multi-chain hot wallet out there and again if you're using something like Exodus and you were putting and you put it on a computer that's not connected 24 7 to the internet then it can be act kind of like a cold storage wallet you just don't want to be putting these Wallets on any computer you're actively regularly using because vulnerabilities vulnerabilities can pop up and you don't want to you know you don't want to find out later that you made a boo-boo somewhere and you the next time you check your wallets they've all been drained and you're not sure why that does happen Okay so be completely warned here but this functions binance smart chain cardano,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY,I mean a lot Stellar lumens ethereum Bitcoin Monero for privacy coins I mean basically the the biggest projects out there uh will function with Exodus I would probably suggest setting up your Exodus wallet before much else uh that way you have something that that's easy to understand with a really easy to use interface and because of how easy the user interface is to work with it'll start helping you make sense of some of the Lesser pretty or user intuitive while it's out there because you'll have a better understanding as to what's what um that's just my humble opinion uh but you can also download this on a mobile phone you there's a browser extension basically everything a lot of these other wallets have you can do with Exodus as well just make sure you back up your seed phrases for everything that you do make sure you keep them safe if you're writing stuff down don't keep anything wet or liquid around any of it and um and then you should be pretty good,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY,but these are the three main ones now there are other wallets uh that that are you know you can look up topless and things like that for some of these wallets I won't I don't use wallets that I do not see uh have a long history of being successful in invulnerable to hacks so just because somebody says oh check out this wallet this is really cool it's the latest and greatest I'm not touching it until it's basically proven itself over time uh because I don't want to get in at the front of a new trend or somewhat new wallet and there are a bunch of vulnerabilities that haven't been patched out,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY,yet so be very weary of stuff like that a lot of hot lists top lists things you you never really know um you definitely always want to be safe you don't want to take unnecessary risks so and one of the other things that I'll leave you with is coinbase while it's probably pretty good and and potentially secure but again it's it's all tied to an exchange directly which you don't necessarily want I always tell people you don't use exchanges as a wallet you use exchanges like a public restroom you go in you do your business and then you get out you don't leave anything important there just what you don't want so let be that as it may uh so yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
hxsajHMvJoY,I mean there are a lot of good opportunities out there there are there's a lot of good software but one tip I would say is check Reddit uh if you're an internet sleuth at all and you know go to reddit.com join the community for whatever blockchain you're most interested in getting involved with or whatever wallet and look at the feedback what is the public saying what's the latest news what's the latest going on this is something I would implore you to spend a little time with and make sure you're downloading something that's safe you're not just using random links thrown around the internet you're just using Reddit to maybe get a little understanding as to you know what is the current sentiment of of the particular wallet you're interested in and uh in in the next couple lectures I'm going to show you guys how to actively set up some of these wallets what steps you need to take and really just how easy it is uh so we'll get to that in just a moment,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JGbO6zep5Bg,so we've talked a bit about centralized exchanges now we want to dive into decentralized exchanges now a decentralized exchange is vastly different than a centralized exchange and I'm going to be very upfront with you it's not anything I would encourage you to use right now I'm none of these uh and and you're going to be tempted the deeper you get into crypto uh the deeper you see some of the gain potential of some of the tokens readily available on these decentralized exchanges um you know often you're going to be able to get first crack at uh launch tokens for particular projects you might be interested in but there are a lot of issues with decentralized exchanges in my opinion uh number one they are to me they they feel and operate in a very insecure insecure way um one of the issues that I see on decentralized exchanges are fake tokens uh to give you an example let's say let's use cardano for example let's say cardano is launching and they're releasing their new token and they're going to do it on a decentralized exchange first well let's say I there's a big fomo rush and everybody's trying to get these uh cardano tokens it wouldn't take very much for somebody to create an artificial token that does nothing it just has the same logo the same name you can create fake tokens fairly easily uh they would obviously not have the same policy ID in the same blockchain data and so forth but very few people check that stuff when they're using any kind of exchange and ultimately you could be spending your Bitcoin or your ethereum or whatever your your primary layer one token is to buy these alt coins and not be any wiser that you're basically buying fake tokens and because it's a decentralized exchange there really isn't anybody you can call to get help or it'll say hey I just bought these fake tokens,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JGbO6zep5Bg,I want my money back it doesn't work that way a decentralized exchange is basically a peer-to-peer it's like almost like a direct transfer of tokens from one person to another's wallet uh practically instantly and it all takes place on the blockchain so you don't it's like a d if a decentralized um or if a centralized exchange is more kind of like your bank where you can go into the bank and they're the middleman between you and a banking transaction a decentralized exchange is the same methodology between you know being able to send value with Bitcoin from point A to point B without the bank a decentralized exchange is a very similar Beast altogether and the majority of these decentralized exchanges operate using their own token uh for facilitating these transactions so that's where you'll see like uni swap token or pancake swap token they all have these tokens and they and oftentimes when a new Dax launches the value of these tokens goes up quite a bit current trading volume right now on uni swap version 3 is over a billion dollars a day which is pretty significant and it's up over 25 percent there's 800 different tokens available on this decentralized Exchange so you know people are using these and and using them successfully but you can also find out that you know using some of these exchanges these decentralized exchanges when you're making transactions within one of these platforms you have to basically allow uh certain permissions and things in your browser wallet so you have to enable hey you have to connect your wallet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JGbO6zep5Bg,okay when you do that you're giving certain permissions for this exchange platform to to use your wallet and then anytime you make a token transaction little Windows pop up do you approve this do you approve this fee do you approve this slippage this and that and that stuff can change quite frequently but you'll notice that there's it's basically a token swap is ultimately what you're doing you're not putting in limit orders you're not saying oh well I'll buy this token for that token when the price reaches X doesn't work that way it's pretty much instant and and it will alert you if the slippage is too high or you can set your settings to say oh I only want like point six percent slippage outside of that I'll wait um so and and you know to each their own,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JGbO6zep5Bg,but when it comes to decentralized exchanges personally I just never trusted them uh especially because a lot of decentralized exchanges they're launched by Anonymous teams and quite frankly I think anything can happen and a lot of these decentralized exchanges are I don't want to say um exclude excluded from regulatory Authority but if the team is anonymous and it's all done on the blockchain and there's nothing leading anyone to developers or teams who do you go after if an exchange or a decentralized exchange were to go south become a bad actor get hacked somehow something of that nature so but at the same time these decentralized exchanges they're not really doing they're not custody providers so you're not storing crypto for the sale you might allocate a certain amount of crypto for a particular asset that you're looking for and these decentralized exchanges create the liquidity between you and somebody that's either looking to buy or sell whatever assets are being traded so you know I think they're fruitful and I think they're useful but not necessarily for me and I've been in the space since 2017.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JGbO6zep5Bg,and primarily what I see a lot of a lot of volume that I see on decentralized exchanges are a lot of shady um high yield apy type crap coins and and and things of that nature and that's just not my my bag either so you'll learn more about decentralized exchanges over your journey in cryptocurrency but for me as yet I haven't really found any significant reason why I want to play with any of them but to each their own,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho, hello guys and welcome to the Moon my name is Carl and I'm going to bring you this DaVinci j15 collaboration bro welcome back to the office oh good to be here man oh you know how I am in the pot five by five I know I know no need to ask anymore I know how you doing I'm I'm very good bro yeah so what were you doing the last weeks we were like you were you were out and about weren't you what yeah I was flying around a little bit yeah yeah I was in Sweden I was um celebrating my little brother's 18th birthday oh that's cool that's cool how did he like it how was his birthday he loved it he was super happy he's 18 but he's mentally disabled so he's more like a 10 year old like maybe eight-year-old or even maybe maybe younger in like mentally,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,but he he gets so happy from from uh from all kind of like um celebrations and and family interaction actions and I actually um I I went to Sweden without telling him so he it was a surprise awesome awesome man if you want if you do you have like any videos with him in your uh or Lifestyle Channel um I do but I didn't upload it yet stay tuned guys oh considering that our turkey video that was funny yes it was guys you have to go and see me and da Vinci when we went to boardroom in Turkey to uh to um to a hotel that was a funny funny video yes it was just yeah anyways we're going to be talking about kyc and AML and uh which exchanges are the that have no kyc and AML and why you would want it and why you maybe even want kyc right so we're gonna be talking about that so um do you know do you know what kyc stands for know your customer so know your customer rules and regulations,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,so what so those rules and regulations just all it means is that you they need to know your name date of birth right and uh possibly your address your local address now um not all cases that need your address they just need who you are or need some sort of form of ID just like a bank would need a formal ID right so that's level one usually that's considered level one of kyc yeah and so there's level two which they require some sort of utility bill now I'm going to teach you guys something okay not saying you should do this I'm not saying you should do that but you know back in the days when I was growing up and that was a long time ago in the galaxy far far away oh wow were there dinosaurs roamed the Earth I have a feeling it's gonna be good to try to get into clubs when we were on underage right in in Kent in Canada it was actually only 18 in order 19 actually 19 to drink 19. but we still wanted to drink when we're 16 17 and 18.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,so how do you manage do you think we managed to do that well we would make fake IDs and it was up to the the owner of the establishment of the certain determine if the ID was fake or not I maybe did this also foreign [Laughter] and so you know maybe maybe some people might uh in the future want to do that with exchanges yeah I don't know if you'd want to do that right but oh yeah you can probably do that and then um but they aren't IDs today like a little bit more um sophisticated so it's like yeah but the Chinese people make excellent copies oh they do yes you can buy them online lots lots there's lots so that's what people do probably yeah you know what you can buy a whole bunch of binance kyc accounts right um and and do spoofing right and how is it done what would fake Chinese IDs that's how they do it oh wow right and we're giving really bad ideas I don't know well that's what other people do that's what yeah yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,I think I think personally I mean I did kyc on on by bit yes I made kyc on binance because I I trust them yes you know but but I don't want to do kyc for like a random random something you know because I then you have to trust those people because they will have your identity in your they they will literally have access to your passport copy and maybe even your address and everything if you send it to them so this is not so good no yeah so you have to be careful that way because there's been a lot of leaks right for example uh some of my uh commonly used passwords is actually available on the internet right now because of uh all the leaks and cracks and stuff like that that has happened in the past years so I don't use those commonly used passwords but they're there in fact people sent me emails saying hey I have your password so I've seen everything and you better pay me x y z and Bitcoin I'm like whatever I give them I said read between the lines see these lines yeah okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,so kyc no no your customer models they have to do it they have to act like a bank and then there's other rules after that right so if if you pass the kyc it might not be over your nightmare might not be over if The Exchange supports AML you know what AML stands for anti-money laundering yes those are anti-money laundering rules is not for monitoring money where if you're a criminal you're like a drug dealer you're not allowed to actually transfer money here no no no no it's not for that no no it's to ensure that you pay your taxes and so they want to know where with anti-money laundering rules they have to know where the money you deposited into the exchange came from did you pay taxes on that money okay and if you didn't right well out you go yeah and so that's the rules of anti-money lottery,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,so what they do is you have you have to prove where you got the money and if they don't believe it if they're not satisfied with what they tell you right that you have to you have to find proof and give it to them in order to cover how you got the money right so if you got it from inheritance you got to prove that the inheritance did occur right and the dates that it did that you did tell them that it occurred and it has to line up so make sure you don't like make up stuff because uh yeah it's got to match up with what you tell them in the first round of AML it's a pain in the butt trust me because I you know what I'll tell you a story of my email stories it's horrible the bittrex the the the exchange that is now bankrupt bit Rex bittrex bittrex yes got bit wrecked Eminem So they they were around like in the very early stages when I jumped into crypto like 2017 that's where I was buying coins yes so was I yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,and I moved the account from like twenty thousand dollars to 10 million right trading the the wait you took twenty thousand dollars to 10 million yeah how did you do that using the little lady strategy no yes no and I'm not joking 10 000 yes dollars to 10 million yes okay that's the topic of next week that's the next video topic for sure bro did you ever make a videos called twenty thousand to ten million no I haven't why I didn't think about that  that's a great video man so anyways what happened was going on with the rest of the story they wanted to they wanted to prove me to prove how did I get 10 million dollars I'm like I traded on your exchange and then you know what they asked they asked for all the trades they should have the chance you should ask them that's stupid no I had to download the trades from their website to give to their AML compliance officer strange I know it was annoying,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,so I think these things it's just it's it sounds like you know Legacy stuff like back you know Banks like these like old systems like it really is um it's annoying so I'm personally very annoyed with the with kyc um I still did kyc now on by bit and buy this because if I don't then I can't use it so I have no choice um but it is annoying I I have to agree you know it's not nice um I asked them multiple times is it possible can you just like make an exception for me like please but they said no no no no it's it's uh it's very important for them if they want to have like a specific license in like a specific country they need to do it like that exactly um it's unfortunate so they have to do it and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,and and it's sad because it makes it very difficult for you to operate with them and especially with companies that just like what happens is they they don't even tell you about the AML they don't tell you that they're going to do AML with you only if you deposit over a certain amount like over fifty thousand over a hundred thousand it depends on the jurisdiction that they're from that they have to do AML only after you deposit so that means your account gets frozen the second you get over that point and so you can't withdraw it's horrible yeah yeah it's crazy it is crazy actually yeah it's okay um summary should people do kyc or should they not well I I think that it's best to do kyc,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,but I know that a lot of people out there don't have any ID they don't have enough ID so there are options if you don't have an IED we've mentioned a few in today's video by the way for people that do care with you and buy a bit I think they're giving now like a hundred dollars as a bonus for doing kyc if you want to do it I have a link down below to buy this there you go yeah so yeah you might as well take that 300 and make a trade I'm sure you can give them some nice trades right the next one definitely so yeah that can turn into a nice big profit if you take some trades so with that said right um kyc I think it's gonna be a necessity in the future going forward because they they have to slow down crypto there will be exchanges right do you have any exchanges in your list of um that don't support kyc,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,well right now I see many people are going from by bit over to bitflix and I have a link down below to that as well um it's it's just providing Alternatives really because Bible is my my favorite exchange like I I love Bible I'm I can't see there I'm trading there um but for everyone who who don't want to be on vibrate anymore many people go to bitflix and um I think it's up to twenty thousand dollars um withdrawal per day or something like this there you go that's very good that's what by bit has been for years but now by Bit by Bit is doing kyc uh upon sign up which is like very early stage kyc it's um yeah makes it tough for people to to trade if they uh it is what it is have they done AML on you in the Bible yet I don't you know I don't know because they'll ask you where you got the money yeah no they didn't do that actually they only did the full kyc like uh passport um address and and all of that stuff yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,yeah wait until they do AML that that's going to be a nightmare if they ever get to that you think they will do that they probably will have to eventually if they want to move up the ranks right of uh and does like etoro do that I I don't know I've never used Victoria because they're like fully regulated they probably do yeah after you put put in a certain amount of deposit yeah they will ask you for okay where'd you get the money yeah yeah that's just the way it is just the ways some things will never change I'm not gonna sing right because he's the singer I'm not me yeah okay um I think that was a very long video yes it is yeah should we should we let's wrap it up I hope you guys learned something I hope you learned some some sort of Knowledge from this that's why we do these videos we want to educate you provide you with the information you need to survive this this crypto attack basically that's what this is it is it's about attacking crypto do you think FTX was a huge inside job,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
0bJ0ZEHd6ho,and they did it the government did it uh like they created maybe FTX and then collapsed it just so they can regulate crypto or 100 yes do you thinking oh that's another video okay now we have two videos twenty thousand dollars to 10 million and FTX was an inside job just like 911. yes there's lots of information improving that yeah so there was 9 11 covet and now FTS yes all right guys thank you so much for watching um DaVinci has a very very nice YouTube channel if you didn't subscribe already you have to go and check it out right now uh links down below DaVinci j15 yes that's it and also my social media is all DaVinci exactly exactly all right guys see you next video bye,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
GU01L6I0BsY, hello guys and welcome to the Moon my name is Carl and I'm going to bring you this cryptocurrency video now let's take a quick look at the price of Bitcoin we are seeing a break uh out out of this uh triangle that I've been talking about for the past few days uh we do have a lot of resistance coming down here we have a resistance line coming down there um and in general I would say that this breakout we're seeing now doesn't change much we are in a downtrend here we have lower highs and we also have uh lower lows on this time frame here as you can see right there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
GU01L6I0BsY,and I even made a video yesterday talking about these lower lows and lower highs so for Bitcoin to change that trajectory on the four hour Bitcoin needs to go all the way up above this level which is thirty thousand dollars so as long as we're below 30 000 Bitcoin is technically still in a bearish trajectory here now there are a few things that could could uh could be seen as a bullish sign you know we do have um something you you could call a um let's say a falling wedge for example if this is a falling wedge then of course that's that is a potential scenario we break to the upside that could happen and you could even make the case that we're breaking out right now uh but I'm gonna stay a little bit neutral here because I I don't see uh the power from the Bulls,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
GU01L6I0BsY,just yet we did see a small break to the upside here but we didn't see any major volume and um I need more conviction more confidence from the Bulls here and the big resistance that we should be watching now in my opinion uh will be right here because of some previous support there resistance there support there resistance there this is the 27.9 000 level so Bitcoin could get a bullish break like this I would probably assume we continue to range here for quite some time um that is just kind of what I'm expecting as of right now in general Bitcoin is kind of a little bit boring right now right we're just kind of ranging here,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
GU01L6I0BsY,and I am still in all of my positions I didn't close any positions um at all since yesterday make sure to go to cryptojobs.com guys why because you can work in crypto look at this buying this is looking for marketing manager uh binance is also looking for an nft marketing manager so they're looking for a bunch of marketing people I guess that's a full-time position and here you can make ten thousand dollars a month on a b c d e uh it's a remote job so you can work from anywhere the binance job is also remote uh if you are in India you can work as an SEO project manager for this company um I would just suggest guys you go to cryptojobs.com the link is always down below you can work for Kraken you can work for for any company um actually you know buy bit has jobs here I have jobs here sometimes um so yeah I would suggest you go right now over to cryptojoss.com anytime I hire someone I always always hire through cryptojob.com because this is basically where I put my my job offerings so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

GU01L6I0BsY,so I just wanted to make a disclaimer here that of course I use Hardware wallets I use Ledger I use engrave and in yesterday's video I talked about specifically engrave because angry engrave is the um uh coldest most secure Hardware wallet in the world so if you don't have an engraved wallet I would suggest you go below this video you click my Link at the top of the description to engrave because if you click my link you will get a discount on this uh incredible um Hardware wallet and like I said it's the safest wallet in the world in my opinion I have this wallet and I also have Ledger but as of,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
GU01L6I0BsY,right now I think most people don't really um trust Ledger anymore and that's why many people are going over to engrave so link down below and as always you have a link also to buy bit thirty thousand dollar bonus you have a link also to bitflix uh where you can deposit 100 and get fifty dollars for free um as soon as you meet the um the volume requirements um and you can also sign up to cast as always you get free tokens and um what else also of course guys okx is also an incredible exchange it's a great competitor uh to buy bit and bitflix and binance so okx and these are all my recommended exchanges if you want to trade it somewhere I would go to trustworthy exchanges I trust these exchanges I don't want to go to exchanges I don't trust because in crypto It's always important to to be careful where you put your money right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

_RkyQFB-ETg, hello gurus and welcome to another episode i'm here with an amazing group of people everyone here is very wealthy and special in in just life i mean here with mm crypto what's your number one tip for like abundance or just in life in general um i think you should think of money and energy in terms of energy you should think long term not thinking that you are going to be rich the next day um in crypto long term could be already five years in other sectors it's a little bit longer and the thing i said first with my with energy try to add value to people right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_RkyQFB-ETg,and it's like an energetic response money flowing back to you so if you just think of your own benefit money is not gonna flow to you um i think these two things things think long term add value and think of energy i think of money in terms of energy and if you incorporate that into your life i think um eventually my money is gonna come your way and flow to europe beautiful and chris's channel is mm krypto on youtube slavik is a famous comedian in germany and movie star and stuff like this what's your advice i think do what you like i agree with chris also but also it's very important to do what you like it's very important you have to love it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_RkyQFB-ETg,and then it will come automatically and you can watch slavic on crypto slavic and this is mo from mo what's your channel on youtube the english crypto or just the german one depending on where you're from i think moe's going to be one of the youngest if not here it's probably one of how old are you one of the richest just had birthday a few days ago actually happy birthday very nice no but now let me let me add the stuff to what's loving and chris said i fully agree with them first of all but as i know your channel is very focused on trading as well right so i wanted to add some stuff there and i think that you have to make a big difference when you're investing and also looking at at the just building your own business right because most people they build their own business right this is the start and you can be emotional there right you should have your emotions you should be very excited to build your own thing,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_RkyQFB-ETg,right that's where your more motivated motivation comes from so when you're building stuff i think emotion is good but when you're investing i think emotion is something you should for sure keep out and i think most people have a little bit of a difference of a difficulty there because most people treat investments the same as they treat like building a business they are super hyped about it they want to do it right now they want to do it quickly and that's good if you want to build something but if you're investing so if your trading channel right i think you should keep emotions out and make a difference there you learned this lesson what's the biggest trade you've ever lost in your trading career even though he's 22 it's gonna show live on youtube actually on my channel it was a three it was a 19 million long position with a 10x leverage and i lost i think like 2.8 million dollars in unrealized profit and 560 thousand dollars in march there's youtube video about it it was one hour and i was on a jet ski it was a very um yeah beautiful,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

_RkyQFB-ETg,stochastic is overbought by volume coming in let's go in the four hourly see what's going to be happening on the four hourly stochastic is coming down from overbought but it's managing to hold here bitcoin the only thing volume has been dropping off but we're still clearly seeing this giant w formation here with volume spikes so i think it's it's very possible that bitcoin does break this big resistance we're at a very strong resistance the target will be 52k ema ribbons we are above the ema ribbons right now and it's holding above the ema ribbons that's bullish bp vr we have a lot of support now at the 42 000 42 000 mark,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_RkyQFB-ETg,and now we've got a lot of support which is beautiful before we only had support down here at the 38k but now the 42k has become a strong support so i still think we're bullish going to the 52k if we can break through here on the hourly we are also turning up with volume building with pressure building but again we need a volume spike to break out of this 48k to go to the 52k i'm going to show you my trades if you want to trade like you're seeing me do under the video here um you can trade using the software that i do under the video go down below hit the thumbs up button join more than let's get a thousand likes on this video hit subscribe join more than 70 000 people click the join button to follow my live trades in stocks in crypto in bitcoin in all coins you see my trades live as i make them in the markets and if you want to join bitcoin trading on buybit this link down below if you go down there click it you get a sign up bonus of 4 600 us dollars now when you deposit bitcoin bitcoin trading on buy bits sign up four thousand six hundred us dollars a bonus,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

1Boq66u_W6E,it's breaking out here like I said yesterday the trade from yesterday massively in the profits and I see a big W formation here but we're right at resistance but a huge W formation if this breaks out on bitcoin this W formation we're right now on the resistance line if that W formation breaks out it will be taking us here on bitcoin Thirty one thousand will be going to 31 31 000 that was a big move yesterday from from twenty five thousand twenty six to twenty five thousand nine hundred twenty six thousand to twenty eight thousand three hundred almost a five percent move and we're breaking through the resistance right now you can see we're above the line getting rejected but breaking through four hourly stochastic heading up hourly stochastic heading up with Volume 15 minutes also heading up with volume it's breaking through right now it's trying to go through um bad move to close my long yesterday in the morning on bitcoin I had I had quite a big long on there and I closed it but that's okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
1Boq66u_W6E,I still think we're gonna move up from that trade yesterday in the afternoon I made this trade which is also massive in the profits if you haven't opened the trade yet I would open a trade on support So support would be there and stop loss right underneath the support here this is the trade setup I would open on bitcoin 40 risk to World ratio trade racing 179 dollars to make 7199 without leverage with 10x leveraged 71 000 of profits this is the trade I'm going to open on bitcoin right now um let's see is it gonna pull back though I need to make sure if it doesn't pull back in Bitcoin rips here I want to be in the trade so this is what I talked about yesterday sometimes and that's what I thought yesterday that we could miss out on the move if it broke through and it did break through we were here when I made the last video and went long in the morning of yesterday we were here when I went long,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1Boq66u_W6E,so I went long and then that was a bad move to close it but in the afternoon trade that's already gone through we were here in the afternoon so we already break through here um so where'd I go along here or would I wait for a pullback that is the question we're at resistance looks like it's breaking through the I don't want to miss the trade and not be in the trade as Bitcoin rips higher but I think strong resistance where we are right now is here so it opened this long better risk to Road risking 125 dollars to make six thousand nine hundred twenty dollars without leverage with 10x leverage 69 000 that's the trade I take on Bitcoin now I'm gonna set up this trade um if you want to trade under the video it has exact steps in the description of the video you have step one take take the crypto Mouse course to learn how to set up your trades and learn technical analysis step two this is in the description of the video sign up to buy,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

1Boq66u_W6E,I'm gonna buy some more FX here s here I'm gonna buy another thousand dollars of fxs at the current price I'm also going to buy another half a Bitcoin here in case Bitcoin decides to run I want to start building the position it's up around five percent today 0.5 but I'm gonna buy another half of a Bitcoin 14 000 worth confirm I just bought another half a Bitcoin just then um I bought one thousand dollars of fxs that Bitcoin trade is filled I just bought half a Bitcoin there and I'm gonna go long on bitcoin like I showed you in the video in the technicals and so I'm going to go along from 20 The Gray Line twenty eight one three four stop loss Twenty Eight so twenty twenty eight one three four I'm going to do a thousand dollar trade with 20x Leverage take profit will be 35k and stop loss is 28k 35k 28k,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
1Boq66u_W6E,so I'm risking 92 dollars to make 4 765 confirmed I'm going to make it because that risk to reward is so good I'm going to make it a three thousand dollar trade with 20x leverage so it's a 60 000 trade so this trade will then be I'm risking 279 dollars to make 14 300 open long so it's a the order will automatically open at 28 134 two Bitcoin trade it's gonna it's gonna be fifty eight thousand dollar trade take profit is at 35k stop losses at 28k confirm order submitted so my order here on bitcoin is now set to bitcoin trade yesterday's long didn't open on bitcoin at 26 900 so I missed that long it's already up a thousand dollars I've got some additional trades that had Toyota and I've got that Bitcoin trade waiting to execute it's going to execute at 28 134 can it pull back a hundred dollars before we don't hopefully we don't miss this trade,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
1Boq66u_W6E,but I do think it will pull back before execute and then start moving up we're at this resistance but again what you could do is you could wait to see if this resistance holds so you could do two things here you could wait to see if it gets rejected if it gets rejected then going long at twenty four thousand that's one possibility if it breaks through though and that's what I think based off the technicals I think we're going to break through so I would um I would try to go along on a little bit of a pullback onto support just pulling back a little bit and then going long taking the target to 35k um that was a big move today let's see if it has any pullback we move from we moved from 26 25 800 to 28 000 500,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

1I7Cg64gDS4, hello gurus welcome to another episode I hope you're having a beautiful day we're going to jump into Bitcoin and ethereum and I'm going to show you technical analysis we're going to try and predict the movements of Bitcoin and ethereum hit the Subscribe button 178 000 people smash up thumbs up button down there and turn on the Bell turn on all notifications and follow the the steps down below to to learn how to do this how to set up your charts how to trade and how to trade on buy bit the links in the description and the pin comment let's jump into the Techno and buy a bit until the 31st so in two days has a free one thousand dollar trade and you can get up to thirty thousand dollars worth of bonuses let's jump into the technicals for Bitcoin now we're going into straight into Bitcoin yesterday we had a pump up um yesterday I had a long open and I closed it around here and then it shot up I opened the shop,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,but then I announced on the video that I closed the short because I didn't I thought it would pump it looked like it would pump after the video I shared in the telegram now we're at this strong resistance line you can see here on the hourly Bitcoin keeps coming up here hitting this resistance hitting this resistance and getting rejected hitting this resistance most likely getting rejected to come back to 25 000. however this pump happened just now because it looks like the US government is going to release receive um they're going to get the debt ceiling past they're going to open up the debt ceiling on the hourly we're overbought it is climbing we've got on the 15 minute we are claiming we have this trend line here we're currently climbing up this trend Lane and I would say that we're through and this is one of the resistance line also on the 15 minutes,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,so this is the channel we're in on the 15 minutes on the hourly you can see we're coming up to this bigger resistance and on the four hour lead this bigger one which would be here this is the resistance here at 27 700. I think because of this debt ceiling news we can get a pump on there and then get rejected but we'll monitor it closely if we just look at this we're in an Elliott wave count I would say we've got a kind of Elliott wave that from the bottom down here at 16k one could say that's two three and this is a bigger move and then this is the correction maybe to here and then fourth wave here that's what I think will happen to bitcoin um but it is holding here it's got a double bottom bounce at 25 000. so it is holding so we've got to see if these waves continue I would say that it will break through here because of the debt ceiling News 2 27 900,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,but again we're at this resistance line on the four hour you can see multiple touches so most like like if it can't break through get rejected and come down to 25k so we need to wait to see what happens here whether it breaks through um then if it breaks through we can go um you could short here with a tight resistance so you could go short on the hourly we're also overbought so what could happen two two trades you could take it could go short from here I would go short from here from this resistance because so many times it's been rejected here at this um at this 27 500 you can see multiple times getting rejected but it is attempting again it is a resistance line on the hourly okay if I zoom out to the four hourly still in this descending triangle which usually plays out like that and then breaks out so right now it's at a descending triangle we also have this very strong resistance line here on bitcoin that pulls down we're in this bigger Channel,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,but I think it could break out here just because of the debt ceiling so the debt ceiling is four hourly overbought hourly very overbought we've ever bought on a lot of time frames you can see here as well okay we could go long take a long just to stay in the lungs at the moment to the to that and I would open the trade a little bit under where we are right now onto these supports there's a very strong area of support on this Lane so it opened the support there stop loss under the weekly and take profit at the White Lane 5.3 restore rotational trade opening the trade at 26 916.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,a stop loss 26 691 take profit twenty eight thousand five point three risk to Road ratio risking 225 to make 1204 without leverage with 10x leverage 12 100x leverage 120 000 of profits that's the trade I'm going to open on bitcoin right now so opening 26916 if you want to trade like you're seeing me do Under the video in the description you can follow these steps take the crypto masterclass to learn how to set up your charts and trading um sign up to buy bit to get that 30 000 free bonus and a free one thousand dollar trade and join the the telegram group where you can all trade and learn together it's a free telegram group and you can watch this free trading video where I teach you how I'm doing this um so those are the in the description of the video step one two three four so over on private in this account my Iota trade is ten thousand dollars in the profits now ten thousand one hundred and eleven dollars if you've been following this video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,I I put in twenty thousand dollars in this trade and made ten thousand dollars so far it's a ninety seven thousand dollar trade up fifty percent which is beautiful if you've been following my trades here and this account I have 287 thousand dollars I've got forty two thousand almost forty three thousand dollars of mcrt one Bitcoin in here 17 000 of uni swap up a little bit today I've got fxs up a little bit I've also got twelve thousand I'm gonna buy another thousand dollars of fxs at the current price by a thousand dollars um also I'm going to open this long on bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,so I'm going to do a 500 trade because I want to do less I want to do not so strong of a trade here because of these resistances so I'm going to do 500 trade with 10x leverage actually let's I'll make it 20x leverage 500 trade with the tight stop loss 20x leverage 500 trade opening price at where I said in the opening price 26916 26916 my loan from yesterday would it would have been much better to keep it open actually 26916 take profit is going to be at 2812 812 wait two eight one two one and stop loss two six six nine one two six six nine one so I'm risking wait two six six nine one two six six nine one it's too little risk to run risking four dollars to make twenty one dollars so I go to up the number of I order up the okay confirm but I gotta up this order I think it's in order by value let's do order by cost,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,so then this trade now order by cost will be order by Cost Plus to 500 dollars and then so this will now risk 81 dollars to make 437 confirm open long it will open along at 26 916.0.363 Bitcoin nine thousand seven hundred dollar trade isolated 20x leverage take profit stop loss set confirm that trade is now set on bitcoin I've got more buy orders for Iota but Iota is not pulling back here which is interesting but I've got a lot of buy orders for Iota set going down so I'm gonna but it doesn't look like it's pulling back at all which is interesting uh my Iota trade again is up ten thousand one hundred dollars in the last few days which is beautiful 50 and I've got that Bitcoin trade set let's jump into ethereum trade now so that's my trade on bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,and then once we get to this resistance then we have to pay we have to watch what happens because either it breaks through here Bitcoin breaks through here and it doesn't come down to this white trend line 25 it just breaks through and pushes up so we're gonna watch what happens at this 28 000 mark this is good news for Bitcoin this debt ceiling race let's go into ethereum now and then I'll do Iota because I want to see what Iota is doing um ethereum 1848 ethereum looks bullish here turning up as well on this debt ceiling news this this inverse Head and Shoulders got rejected so that means it's really good news that we didn't have these inverse Head and Shoulders play out on the four hours we're getting a bounce on this trend line on The Daily I'm seeing big cup in Hindu and bottoming formation double bottom with big volume coming in since the bottom at 1000 or 700.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
1I7Cg64gDS4,inverse Head and Shoulders looks like a cup and handle stochastic is turning up on the daily on the four hourly stochastic also turning up we've got this this kind of descending descending triangle playing out here and it's at the resistance line ethereum could go for a strong run right now if ethereum breaks out right now the target will be the base of the triangle as I teach in the crypto Master course tiger will be 23 2300 which if you've been following my videos I talked about that being the target a long long time ago um do you guys remember when we were buying at 700 700 I told you my target was two thousand three hundred dollars and now we're very close if this breaks out right now ethereum crypto could go for a strong run and it looks like it could do this very soon so I'd go long on ethereum as well opening Along on ethereum from here a little bit of a pullback to the supports whereas the support I would say the supports are here stop loss just underneath the weekly and take profit at the Target 21 wrist toward ratio trade risking 24 dollars to make 507 without leverage 10x Leverage is five thousand dollars 100 100x Leverage is 50 000 that's the trade I would take on ethereum on the four hourly of heading up on the hourly heading up big pressure now because of this debt ceiling race this news of the debt ceiling race so just now they announced that they're going to raise the debt ceiling also don't forget on by bit um you've got you can get up to one thousand a free one thousand dollar trade when you use the link in the description and the pin comment so going down below follow the steps start your journey in the crypto we'll take the crypto Master course sign up to baby get 30 000 bonus and a free one thousand dollar trade and join that free telegram group and then take that um that free trading and my trade on Iota is up 9800,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

dEbbTTdWupY, hello gurus welcome to another day I hope you're having a beautiful day we're gonna jump into charts for Bitcoin I'm going to show you some mcrt stuff which is amazing the smart contracts the lobby systems we're only building something I'm really impressed with what the team has been building I was looking at looking through all the websites and all the different things amazing I'm going to show you some in the video but,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dEbbTTdWupY,Queen by the way first I just want to say everyone look at my watch list look what we've been buying what we've been trading look at my watch list from yesterday do you all see this it's like every single one is green and these are very different like asset classes very different things and look at my watch list Booyah everyone this is this is skill this is like Mastery of attack of an art this is something that I built a big position on Iota if it plays out 1 697 percent gain so 16 times I've got a hundred thousand dollar trade so it'll become 1.6 million if this plays out now it might it could be delayed more it could take years but it's on some major support here it's stochastic very oversold so I built a big position but anyway that position is already up on by a bit I opened it the last week it's up already ten thousand nine hundred dollars it's a hundred thousand you know if you remember I tried to get it to 250 000.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dEbbTTdWupY,now it's at like 10 900 but 54 because I only use 20K so it's already made almost eleven thousand dollars plus so I have Thirty one thousand dollars now in this from 20K now plus almost 11k so I have 31 000 from a Trader open last week if you follow my video in this account 288 000 mcrt Bitcoin uni swap fxs that's what is in this account and on my watch list I have some stocks but let's jump into Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin green a little bit big volume coming in that channel you can see this clearly this channel here most likely playing out like this let's go closer this is each candle becomes daily now just zoomed in so each of the candles is daily you can see here that it's on some support it's trying to hold here but most likely coming to the channel most likely coming to here but it's climbing so even though it's it's moving sidewards so it's not dropping even if it comes down now it's not 23 like it used to be it's like 25 now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dEbbTTdWupY,you know what I mean because it's moving sidewards even if it comes down to the bottom of the channel it's not so big of a drop anymore volume turning stochastic turning up four hourly volume overboard double wave as well usually on double top on on stochastic it could mean top it's getting rejected got rejected off this trend line exactly as I said if you took the trade from early today congratulations already in profit it's got rejected here and if it's hard to hear you need to see because usually it should play out 70 of the move so it should come down like that then break out that's what would usually happen it's getting rejected here but again Bitcoin is showing strength on the the four hourly and the daily before I looking overboard but the daily is not that's why I think and with the pivot the FED Printing and things like this I think we could get a spike out of here so that's my intuition I think we're going to get a spike out of here um I had some Longs open,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dEbbTTdWupY,but I closed the long yesterday which was a mistake actually Bitcoin is up a lot from that previous yesterday long but I think I'm going to go along here on a rejection so I'll put along from this supports because it's built a lot of support here from 27 122. I want to get a big long for Bitcoin but it's at resistance it's at resistance that's the only thing it can come down to 25 and even come down as I said to this 24 but it's not such a big drop so it's worth the risk to reward so I'm going to open a Bitcoin trade here on the support so on this support here stop loss below the weekly and take profit I make it I make it a really long-term trade for Bitcoin foreign trying to do it with all of this is done by my phone the recording the trading stocks I also buy a lot of stocks in,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
dEbbTTdWupY,so okay now we're going to find where the big resistances are where are all the big resistances where we need to put take the profit the first big resistance is the top of this White Lane the next big resistance is these previous supports that have turned now into resistance so 20 this is where here at 29 000 we have so much resistance so that's a point where it's going to hit resistance very strong resistance 29 almost 30k is a very strong resistance so that lines up perfectly with the toggle of this breakout from this triangle that I showed you before which is beautiful so longer term that's the trade setup would set on bitcoin and then I go closer just to see how I can sit so it can pull back a little bit here to the bottom of this channel so here so this is the trade I could that's how that's how it's set it because on the 15 minutes an hourly is pulling back 15 minutes well look at that cell spec,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
dEbbTTdWupY,but I ate the cells very quickly not major drop could really miss out here if it could just shoot out of here but I think one more rejection then so that trade will be a longer term one but I would leave this yeah that's the big resistance at 30k but I would leave this trade out of here because if that's coming out of here it could go for the the biggest resistance for Bitcoin is up here 22 times restore reward risking 362 to make 8 192 dollars per Bitcoin without leverage but remember you can buy a thousand dollars of a Bitcoin with 10x leverage it's 810 000 no 81 000 with 100x leverage 810 000. so this is a trade that I would take on bitcoin but I already have I've got this Iota trade up 11 000. I've got this Bitcoin trade that's set here at 26.96 I mean 26 916 is pretty close to where we are right now there should be a pullback to that level so I'm already gonna go along but let's put that border but I'll take the take profit at 35k take profit at 35 000.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
dEbbTTdWupY,that makes 2934 and I risk eighty one dollars let's let's take more risk because it's nice trade can I risk 114 dollars more risk okay 114 why where is uh 26. so 114 to make 2 900 but then I'm gonna I'm gonna add more to this trade so I'm going to add more to this order I'll make it one big two Bitcoin to bitcoin so now I'm risking 630 dollars to make sixteen thousand nice restored beautiful so that's on bitcoin if you want to trade like me or also check out mcrt I I recommend looking at it um doing your own research this is the yearly chart for mcrt the yearly chart for mcrt,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

F1uos4QIWNM,James love you thank you and you can see here um also mcrt is pumping and it's even pumped more today mcrt is doing amazing you can get it on by bit um mcrt is pumping which is beautiful I'm the founder of that project these were my some of my games yesterday 2 900 BNB and Bitcoin uh this account up now more than 170 000 uh I also set an order for avax yesterday and that was some of the stock gains this was in the middle of the day and I also said in order for avax at 14 a 20 000 trade on the news that AWS partnered with avax which is beautiful so that's what's happening on bitcoin um that's what's happening in the market and again join the links down below let's see what else we got we just got a lot of um a lot of games Guru you're changing my life thank you for the lessons let's check out BNB as well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
F1uos4QIWNM,so I can show you what I think is going to happen for BNB these are gains from the students just from yesterday this is only from yesterday everyone this is just one day not the day before the day before was up here and you can see the gains from everyone this was the day before yesterday and same thing many people can graduate 309 um six many people thank you James well James this was the day before and it's been almost every day which is epic look at all these this is the last few days congratulations to all of you let's go into BNB so we can track this trade that's my target for Bitcoin and the trade setup again trading would on by bit and that's the long I have already set my take profit on by bit is already set um 170 I might take profit on bitcoin is set at 25 000.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
F1uos4QIWNM,if it hits 25 000 this trade will make eighteen thousand dollars of profits and it's already in profits on B and B and Bitcoin let's check out BNB now because I have an active trade on there and avax also pumped 30 after I made that that trade set up um which is beautiful BNB is pulling back a little bit still bull flagging it is overboard on the four hourly it's sitting on the support line now it breaks through the major resistance the next big resistance 295 but the huge resistance is at 322 and we zoom out we can see this formation for BNB um as a giant bullish pennant so this could have a huge move on BNB but the real big resistance on BNB is actually not into 334 and I've got the take profit on this trade at 322. let's set it for 334 and that will give me a profit of six thousand dollars on this trade which is beautiful,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
F1uos4QIWNM,so that's the updates in the market um thank you for watching everyone big congratulations to all of you my goals to make you all rich and to show you what I've been doing for 21 years love you all have an amazing day hit the Subscribe button smash the Thumbs Up Button this channel from cryptocoon I'll see you all again tomorrow,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rR7gKAZFtcI, hello gurus welcome to another episode hope you're having a beautiful day we're gonna jump into the charts for Bitcoin Bitcoin pumping congratulations all of you saw on my telegram everyone I asked to share your gains and it's like thousand people posting amazing gains thousand percent six hundred percent thousands those amazing and fxs pumping Bitcoin we're gonna jump in charts hit the Subscribe button smash that thumbs up button is Bitcoin going to keep going is it going to pull back what I think markets let's go now so it's seeing Bitcoin breaking out touching this it's already on the EMA um The Golden Cross resistance you can see here it's the 50 moving average I think hold on it's the style 55-day moving average is the orange one 200 moving average is the yellow one so it's the 200-day moving average we just hit and it didn't get rejected very strongly which is interesting,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rR7gKAZFtcI,but you can see it perfectly touches the 200 moving average on the on the Daily overbought Four early but no double tops or anything we've still got kind of a kind of hammer formation on the last candle the Bitcoin trade we got from 22 500 pumped beautiful hit Target already hit the take profit made higher low and higher high and it looks like something giant like if you zoom out also on the daily something big happened with the golden cross nice but the stochastic is overboard on the four hourly so some pullback on The Daily also but heading up on the month on the weekly it's like curling up like really strong bull flagging on the on the stochastic this one here these two red and blue land above the dotted line it's overbought,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rR7gKAZFtcI,but it's like kind of dub if it doesn't double top here this will be a big sign that we keep going next resistance 28 959 this one is a strong resistance that I talked about when we're buying it at 16 17K this is exactly this top here 25.29 but in my opinion it's breaking higher resistance and go to 28959 which is beautiful long term if you zoom out it's bouncing off the bottom after a drop from 69 000 to 16 000 and we're getting a bounce the big resistance you can see here back in May 2021 we bounced off these supports so 28 000 959 is also a big resistance but close to the bottom you can see it's bouncing off the bottom which is beautiful if you want to trade Bitcoin over trades open and the people in telegram this trade 7173 in the profits in discount 1.5 Bitcoin USD I was I moved I've still got a hundred and seventeen thousand I'm missing the pump a little bit on bitcoin,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rR7gKAZFtcI,but that's okay because also fxs and stocks are pumping diversify is good even if you can make heaps of money on bitcoin don't go all everything in one thing pick like seven that are amazing Matty cup stand up gaming tokens pumping which is nice um Bitcoin 24 8 let's look what the total market cap tells us to see if we pull back as well same thing exactly the big resistance you can see on the total market cap 2021 pull back to 1.18 trillion and now we're sitting at 1.07 trillion big resistance where it was previous support is now one point one eight trillion so another 1.100 billion to add to Big resistance which is beautiful um thank you for watching everyone if you want to trade the Subscribe uh join buy bit down below I'm trading on buy bit binance is also the two biggest exchanges for trading um both the reliable both are pretty big they're the biggest exchanges they're and they have backing or showing their audits and things like this um would I be selling now whenever something gets very overbought Bitcoin know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rR7gKAZFtcI,but whenever something gets very overbought if you want to actively trade sell it when it comes back down on a correction buy it again um if you're holding Bitcoin for long term this was a really good entry especially especially if you've got it at 16k which is beautiful now you have lots of money what do you do that's the question first you're going to learn you're going to start googling how do I how do I retire what do I do and it's going to tell you go on walks read some books go out with friends blah blah blah and then you're going to get bored then you're going to go live on an island and spend like four years living in Ireland doing like nothing smoking chilling riding motorbikes then you're going to want to start doing stuff again,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rR7gKAZFtcI,and then you're going to want to do something that you're very that you love and that you're passionate about so go straight to that build something or do something that you love to do from the beginning then it's not work then you're making money and working all the time without actually working yes thank you for watching have a nice day and I'll see you all again tomorrow,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA, hey what's up everybody AJ writes crypto here and welcome to the price prediction department for today's price prediction Department buy a high level of demand I am going to cover Quant first of all I have to say I mean Quant was just trending on Twitter yesterday I am very impressed uh with the community as a whole I do personally hold a little bit of Quant myself first of all I just want to send out a sincere thank you to all the positive feedback I've received for this segment of the show I have so many people reaching out to me like I'll cover this coin cover that coin and listen I hear you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,I got you I have a list this long of all the coins I'm going to cover but still let me know in the comments what you want to hear and whatever coin like shows up the most is the one I'm going to cover on the next episode at the end of this video I am going to give some of my Quan away to people on Twitter who accurately guessed my price prediction so stay tuned for that so let's jump into my Quant price prediction thank you [Music] thank you Quant with the ticker qnt is the coin for the Quant Network which was launched back in 2018. the Quant Network consists of the over Ledger operating system multi-chain apps the over Ledger Network the over Ledger Network Marketplace the treasury and the Quant token which we're going to dive into today I'm not going to dive too far under the hood with Quant,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,but I do want to say that the over Ledger operating system is like the Beating Heart for Quant so when you think about Quant I really don't want you to think about it as a blockchain because technically it's not a blockchain but that doesn't mean it doesn't work with blockchains basically how I see it if cities on a map where all other blockchains right Quant is like the highway and the road between all of those other blockchains Quant is the king of interoperability and that is why this coin is in such high demand according to the Quant website overledger is the world's first single API Gateway providing Legacy systems with access to all blockchain networks basically how the over Ledger operating system works is that it sits on top of existing blockchains and it doesn't just sit on top of blockchains it can sit on top of other Legacy Technologies which is why Quant will be used in things such as like the cross-border payment system it will be used in the future of cbdcs and stuff like that there are some people in crypto that don't really like the ethos of Quant that much because Quant is working hand in hand with governments such as the bank of England to put together cbdc's for the future so for all you anti-cbdc crypto fans out there this isn't exactly the project for you the way I see it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,I don't discriminate against charts if a chart has profitability regardless of what it is connected to it doesn't matter to me I will get into a project if I know it's going to be profitable there is a fine line of morality there love it or hate it but that's how I operate I am in this game I am in the this trading game to make money and I'm sure most of you out there are as well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,so basically how it works is that without Quant you can't connect to the Quant Network and if you want to use the over Ledger operating system you have to be connected to the Quant Network and that's where developers can make multi-chain apps also known as M apps when I think about Quant I think about Gilbert Verdian and all of the utilities that Quant has in the real world first of all quant's founder and CEO Gilbert Verdian has an excellent track record it's actually impressive when you look at all of his former roles in jobs that he had this guy worked at BP for digital security he he worked as a security lead at the ministry of Justice in the UK he was the Chief Information Security Officer for vocal link which is a MasterCard company he worked in cyber security at the bank of England he worked at the secure payment Task Force at the Federal Reserve and he is also a founder of the iso standard TC 307 and that's standard tc307 is now used in over 60 countries to help guide blockchain development this guy is the real deal so basically we're looking at a guy that has over 20 years of experience in the cyber security industry what made him want to create Quan and the over Ledger system is that he used to work in health care and in healthcare you know some patients have different files and different hospitals and there's all this different data all over the place and interoperability kind of helps you know connect all of those Pathways together,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,and then he realized how much of a utility that would be to apply it to blockchain technology and that's exactly what he did and when you look at all the things Quan is capable of it really gets me thinking I mean the real world utility for Quant includes cross-border Payment Systems supply chain cbdc's Regulatory Compliance digital identity management The Internet of Things connectivity defy and not to mention government and public sector applications and on top of it all is what Quant can do for Enterprise adoption yes retail can get you pretty far in crypto but is going to be the Enterprises that really Drive Mass adoption and crypto in the future and Quant is very much involved in this equation obviously Quant has a plethora of important Partnerships,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,but I just want to talk about two in particular the first one that stands out to me is cyanet and Saya chain and these are existing Financial infrastructures that already have access to over 570 other Banks and financial institutions and since they're partnered with Quant they have access to the over Ledger which unlocks that interoperability that connects them to so many other you know distributed ledgers other blockchains other Banks it's not just about communication between blockchains it's about communication with everything and the other partnership and in my opinion the more impressive one is with Hyper Ledger hyperledger is an open source project focused on developing Enterprise grade blockchain Frameworks tools and libraries some of you may know that it's hosted by the Linux Foundation another thing you might not know is that half of the Fortune blockchain 50 companies use hyper Ledger it's really just impressive when you look at the list of all of the companies that use hyperledger foreign [Applause] [Applause],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,[Applause] if you can't already tell I'm pretty bullish on Quan and I could sit here for hours and talk about how it works and all the Partnerships and how they all work together but I feel like I gave you a pretty good rundown now let's get to the price prediction Quant is currently Priced,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,Right Around a hundred dollars it hit its all-time high in September 11 2021 at about 428 other coins are super difficult to do price predictions on because their circulating Supply is sort of a moving Target coins like Doge for instance you know Doge prints 14 million new coins every day so you kind of have to do that extra math and see how hard the market cap has to catch up to its inflating Supply Quant is a relief for doing price predictions on because it has a fixed supply of tokens at around 14.8 million notice I said million not billion this is less than Bitcoin if you think about Bitcoin you know it has a little over 19 billion coins in its Supply and how high that price could go and you think to yourself Quant has less coins than Bitcoin I kind of really start to get excited on what's possible for Quan's price action in the future like I said the max Supply is 14.8 million but the circulating Supply is a little over 12 million so there's a little over 2 million coins that are unaccounted for so when are those coins going to enter the supply the truth is it's hard to tell because if you go back on a snapshot to see how many coins were in the supply at the time in say February of 2020 it says Quant has a little over 12 million tokens and then if you look at a snapshot of just last week it says Quant has the same amount of tokens no tokens came out no tokens came in it's gridlocked at that exact number but there's still two million more coins left in its Max Supply it took me a little bit of digging to find this but all coin buzz says that those other 2 million coins are actually held by the company they are also unlocked which means that they could be sold at any time so keep that in mind but at the same time 81 of the tokens are already in its Supply and there's only two million more to go and even if those two million more are added in we're still 5 million less than Bitcoin Supply right now so the supply is super bullish for Quant there's other things I like more about Quant than other tokens as well if you look at a coin like Matic and you realize that the top 100 holders that hold Matic hold 85.8 of the supply that doesn't really feel the best when you buy a coin and you know the top 100 holders hold most of the supply but when you look at a coin like Quant the top 100 holders only hold 37.8 of the supply so Quant is much more friendly in terms of how many whales are holding at the top and it's also more friendly because it has some very very small Supply which means that the price for this coin which is only at a hundred dollars could go absolutely to the Moon think about it like this we've established that Bitcoin has a larger Supply than Quant,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,right so if Quan had bitcoin's market cap of 519 billion one Quant would be worth 43 000 not bad for a coin that's only a hundred bucks you know me I like to be realistic I like to do Moon math but I don't like to do this insane crazy expectation Moon map I want to keep it realistic to see what we could actually do in the coming bull run with Quan so remember the equation for Price predictions is market cap divided by circulating Supply,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,so we established the supply which has been the same for years actually was the same supply for the last Bull Run so like I said when Quant hit its all-time high of 428 dollars its market cap was a little bit over 4 0.8 billion dollars at the time since the supply isn't changing the only thing that is going to change for the coming Bull Run is the numerator the market cap how high can quantum's market cap go if Quant had a 10 billion dollar market cap it would equal out to about 828 dollars per Quant if we 3x the previous market cap from the last all-time high that would be about 13.8 billion in market cap and that would give us about an eleven hundred and fifty dollar Quant and since it's at a hundred dollars going to a thousand is a 10x but to be completely honest with you when I think about all of the utility with this coin how it's going to change the game for the global cross-border payment system it's working with the bank of England to make a CBD it is the road that is connecting the dots of all the other blockchains in existence this coin could change the game so for this price prediction is going to be one of my more bullish price predictions out of all of them I will probably ever do I might be shooting for the Stars just a little bit on this one so for my official price prediction for the top of the next Bull Run for Quan I am thinking somewhere between fifteen hundred dollars and sixteen hundred and fifty dollars where the latter is a market cap of 19.9 billion and like I said with this coin and how well the supply works with it this coin could go much higher than that I'm just trying to be somewhat realistic but remember if Quan had bitcoin's market cap we're looking at a 43 000 coin it's absolutely ridiculous so boom there you go first of all I'd like to thank the community members of quan on Twitter that helped me out with some questions I had for this video to give them a shout out their names are at San nl11 and at the miles Braun thank you guys for your help I really appreciate it and also San nl11 has some really interesting threads on Quan if you want to read them on your own time also on my Twitter at ajrates,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZPH2ekOI5BA,crypto I said that I would do a giveaway for those who correctly guessed my Quan price prediction no one guessed it exactly but these three people came close at RK limmus hard flow coins and getting hangry and getting hangry said 1650 was conservative so if you are one of those three people shoot me a DM and I will shoot you over some Quant my name is AJ rates crypto let me know in the comments what coins you want to see on a future price prediction department and have yourself a great rest of your weekend foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] thank you [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZGap7kb14gI, [Music] what's up everyone all right well today is my 38th consecutive green day it is a small green day it's a day where i kind of got stopped out because i got almost to my daily goal i was up 4 000 and then i gave back more than half now i'm at 1 500 and i'm saying you know what this is my cue to walk away i'm moving in the wrong direction i had a good size loss on atxg and i had a good size loss on tlf and those brought me from just shy of the daily goal to you know 1 500 on the day and i think it's this is the time to know when to walk away so at the end of this episode i'll give you the link to the video that i recorded over the weekend on the habits the seven habits that um all of the traders at warrior who have verified over a million dollars share and that was ten we have ten traders who made over a million dollars well now we have 11.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZGap7kb14gI,herman just got his million dollar badge today so super excited for him he had a 500k badge i had already done an interview with him uh when he got that 500k back badge it's in chapter 17 of the warrior pro classes where i interview profitable traders so now he's gotten an upgrade to his million dollar badge as always you guys know this we don't uh we don't track the typical result of traders in our community we don't have access to the broker statements but we do give traders the opportunity those who are doing well to prove it by sending over their broker statements and so we've got now 11 traders in the community who have verified over a million dollars in profit big thumbs up big pat on the back we're really proud of you guys her mom great job so we're gonna do another interview soon um for members that um are probably curious to hear more about his strategy he is a small cap trader uh,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

ZGap7kb14gI,so i'm going to do my recap here today was a uh just a sort of disappointing day in a way it is my 38th consecutive green day so i can't complain about that i'm up 435 in my retirement account plus 1100 in my main account you can see how with the press of a button i can switch between those two accounts at lightspeed which is nice um i like being able to do that but um in any case so um today started um it started fine i got some some good trades my first trade of the day was on qnrx so let's look at qnrx um looks like i actually already had it up okay so pre-market this was uh on our gap scan you know it was it was looking interesting and i took a trade on it my first trade was right here that micro pull back there to anticipate the break through four we got up to four double top i made about 260 on that first trade so relatively small winner but you know green is good um it sold off dipped back down,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZGap7kb14gI,i got back in it as it came back up over here going into the open and we got a test of 422. so in total only 339 of profit on qnrx nothing really exciting but you know again small green trades is good uh the next one was um tlf and this one was mentioned by some traders as being an otc uplist and it squeezed at like 7 55 8 am from 8 bucks to 16. then dropped all the way back down here and i got in it at about 8 48 850 as it started squeezing up right here i only got partial fills first trade uh filled 150 shares i then added and got myself up to like 1200 shares and i took it off the table as it squeezed up for eleven hundred dollars and didn't realize it but i was in my main account for that trade i had logged out,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZGap7kb14gI,i had uh changed one of my hot keys and then saved it logged out logged back in and was in this account when i logged back in by default so made that 1100 there then switched to my retirement and traded it again and i ended up having a really nice trade on it right here for the breakthrough 928. we got to move up to ten uh nine seventy and then up to ten dollars and then i got back in right here and this was my biggest position of course of the day six thousand shares right here for the breakthrough ten and it flushes down to nine and i went from up on it to red and i i was up at that time in this account like around 3 200 something like that and that dropped me to up only 700,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZGap7kb14gI,so it was like a 20 you know 2500 loss it was a good size loss and not bad considering i had 6 000 shares i suppose but you know i lost like almost 54 you know 40 cents a share um i was in in the 80s and stopped out in the 30s or 40s 9 30 9 40. and it just ended up selling off so in net i'm only up like 600 on tlf and then i i was like okay you know what at that point i was up 700 net in this account plus 1100 here so i was like okay i'm at 1800 on the day i was at 4 000 roughly i need to be really careful here and my next trade was atxg at the open it pops up right here and it breaks six,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZGap7kb14gI,i jumped in at like 605 or something like that it squeezes up to 645 up to 694 and i was like finally here we go dead cat bounce we're gonna have a green a green candle on the daily let's go and then uh it pulls back off of seven i bought the dip at 650 it goes lower i add more at 628 it goes lower add more at six and then i finally stopped out and it broke six and i went from up 1100 on it to down 270. and at that point i was like you know what i'm done this is this is stupid i'm frustrated and that's that ability to recognize in myself that i'm getting annoyed i've had two kind of bigger losses today uh small winners and bigger losses that's not great but some days are going to be like that and so i'm going to walk away i'm going to keep it my 38th consecutive green day and make it a 1500 day i was at four so dropped down a bit,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZGap7kb14gI,but you know whatever it is what it is so we'll be back at it tomorrow i saw shph went up three halts in a row of course didn't want to chase that so no trades on it not taking the risk um it's just i'm not in the position to take that risk so missing that opportunity sai do oh i got a couple trades on sideu on the break of four but that wasn't even that clean i got in at like 399 it goes up to 411 drops down goes to 417 drops down goes back up to 428 and now drops back to 340. so it just feels like things aren't super clean today um which is a little bit disappointing but you know it's the way it sometimes goes i i think we're still kind of you know we're back from the long weekend this is a back to school week for a lot of kids so i think that it's just kind of a funny first week of september kind of the thing that we're in the overall market is still pretty weak we're right at this ascending support trend line,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZGap7kb14gI,so it's just a time i think to be a little bit more cautious and you know i'm i'm grateful to be locking up small green days i mean i i really i can't complain sure it would have been nice to finish up four or five and hit the daily goal but um oh and there's shph halting down no surprise there predictable um so you know it's just the way it goes um but you know what was pretty exciting was um uh seeing my 11th student earn his million dollar badge today her mom really proud of him he just earned his million dollar badge today which makes him the 11th student and my now latest student to make over a million dollars trading so nice job herman congratulations he's a small cap trader he's in the small cap room and um i have an interview with him already in chapter 11.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

ZGap7kb14gI,all right so that's it for me choppy day but a green day and maybe tomorrow will be a little cleaner and a little easier one of the things i talked about in case you didn't already check it out i talked about the seven traits that um i think all of my millionaire students have and that anyone who becomes successful um share i've got them right here uh but rather than just list them all off why don't you guys check it out on the video that i'm gonna put right here all right so my 10 millionaire students well now it's 11 but these are the traits that they seem to maintain all right so check that out and i'll see you guys back at it tomorrow morning,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI, all right everyone so I'm going to go over my trades for today and boy look at that rejection candle that we just had on v l o n holy smokes this thing was just at the halt up level at 119 and the bottom dropped out it just flushed all the way to 95 cents I mean this is a big drop for a cheap stock well I guess vlon is my biggest winner today um but I so today was a tough day and I'm at my Max loss because I know I spent over a thousand dollars on commissions so I'm down five grand today so daily Max loss five thousand hit the max loss shutting it Down live to trade another day I could certainly keep trading and I'm exercising discipline to stop before it gets worse the writing is on the wall the problem today is I had um you know I had like 15 base hit trades and then I caught a three thousand dollar loss on licn,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,and I didn't expect it I didn't see that coming so we'll look at that trade for sure and then after that I jumped into a trade on gns with 10 000 shares which was a little aggressive and I caught a 20 cent flush on that and that that was basically that that was it I was like all right writing's on the wall I'm being too aggressive I got a that was a that was one of those kind of jumped right in quick and added double the loss on the day so anyways all right let's go back to the beginning of the day so uh today I started first trade of the day in the red xpom right so xpon uh I'm down uh what is it 600 on it uh so I started on xpon let me switch over to my other time frame so first trade was on xpon this was uh at about 7 A.M uh I jumped in this it was actually 7 20. so it was not there it was right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,all right so it breaks through the high right here the high of this candle was uh 373 and I got into 382 and 389. it hit a high of 393. I got in high uh I thought because it just broke out and it was you know it was squeezing up that it was going to continue so it was a momentum trade basically jumping in 10 cent stop just let's see what it does it stalled out and it took a 400 loss on the first trade I got back in when it came up right here and took a 200 loss right there which put me down 600. two losses in a row in xpon I don't like that down 632 on it I was like nope I can't trust this stock anymore did not go back for it that was it two trades two losers that was that all right so that was xpom the next trade was on comms and this actually recouped the 600 I was read on um on xpon and I got myself up maybe like 100 on the day comms I close I'm I'm at 434 right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,but I was up a little over a thousand on it so gave back half my gains on it but anyways um so I started trading that one uh right in this area so we got a break of v-wap right here we got a pullback and then we got this move here through 577 up to a high of 6.608 I hit my Peak as it hit 608 but I then added back at six it went lower I gave back some profit on it and anyways um it didn't end up giving me really that much in profit but I did trade it first on the break of v-wap right here then on this breakout right here and I traded it again as it came back up right here uh I traded it actually one last time at the open so I traded it on I guess four different um spots on that chart and yeah I thought I had more in it but it didn't,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,and now you're kind of already seeing a little bit of jumping around which I'm okay with I cut the losses on losers I focus on the winner I focus on what's strong comms was uh one of the leading gappers when it was at its peak the vlon we'll look at that one for sure that one's a cheaper stock clnn I saw it uh move up floats 44 million shares I expected it would be choppy and yeah it was pretty choppy you got a nice squeeze there up to 240 more than I expected and then it sells off so that was clnn no trades on that one for me so the next trade after coms uh let's see was MTC MTC I'm up 577 on it it's not much uh I got in it as it broke one dollar so 99 Cents it ends up oh actually I guess it um had another trade right there I didn't see that anyways I missed that one,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,but I traded it right here from a dollar to a high of a dollar eleven ten thousand share starter position average four cents five cents a share 500 bucks took two trades on it uh I thought what I liked about this was as it was hitting this high it was the leading gapper in the whole market and I was like okay here we go leading gapper this stock is squeezing it's a cheaper stock but Traders are focusing on leading gainers and that just kind of rolled over I'm surprised that it came back up from a low of like 77 cents all the way back up to 127 but then it came back down so after um comes and MTC and the xpon trade I had Silo and you can see after all that I was up maybe like 700 on the day I wasn't up by a lot and I knew even at that time that my commissions were churning,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,and so I was like I'm I'm probably break even on the day so Silo that one hit the scanners popped up for a second didn't hold got out of that quick uh that was silo there was some news out on it uh this morning but you know it just didn't hold up well popped up there to three 353. so then I had let's look at licm all right so licm I someone called this out in chat and I looked at and I was like okay here we go I like that daily chart it's a recent IPO blue sky on the daily chart is over 425. it's got after hours and pre-market highs of five and it was at 450 and there was a bid the spread was pretty tight I jumped in at 4 55. I added 465. it hits a high of 475. I was like this looks good I had 10 000 shares and then it dropped to 418 on one 10 second candle I don't know it was just a big sell order I guess it pops back up to 450,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,and I got out of that with a three thousand dollar loss that was a big loss I didn't expect that and that's just unfortunately so what could I have done to avoid this well I could have said I'm not going to trade it because it's not the leading it's not one of the top three leading gainers or gappers and attention is maybe a little too dispersed today okay but it was a good daily setup I do like that daily setup a lot and these ones can make big moves so I don't know um I don't know it's just it ended up being you know one of those traits with that's a loser and I could have maybe just said it's not the leading Gainer and so for that reason alone I'll wait and maybe trade it when it's higher up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,but if I had waited I would have certainly missed a good chunk of the move but you know the the big flush there unfortunately you know that sometimes happens someone had a sell order ready to go it triggers and that dropped it so it was unexpected and it put me down you know because I was only up a couple hundred before that trade so that put me down you know 2500 on the day or 2800 on the day but I knew I at that point was already turning commissions and then I had um an immediate loss I jumped in gns that gns hit the scanners and I was like okay gns you know daily chart if it's you know we're on a pullback this could be this could be good Traders are probably going to be focusing on this one I jumped in it at um it was high I got in it like five uh sorry 650 655 665 hit a high of 6.75 and then it dropped all the way back down to 6 20. took a two thousand dollar loss on that one and I was like,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,okay I'm down at that point a little over four grand I was like this is this is not good uh I think I'm gonna have to probably call it here and that was that the time was about 9 23. so I was like I think I'm gonna have to call it um but let me just I'm not quite in my Max loss so let me just let's just see what happens um so v-l-o-n um it starts to pull away I guess it was at the open um so let's see I I jumped in this I hesitated I had the order ready for 15 000 shares at the open I was waiting for it to dip down it dipped down to 88 I was like do I punch it and I was like 88 cents that's a little cheap man you usually don't trade stocks even below a dollar so I was like no no just just wait on that for a second so then it pops back up here to 98 cents and I was like son of a gun that's 10 cents off of 88.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,but then it drops right back down back to 88 and I was like okay no you were right you're right and then it comes back up and I was like God dang it so my I was going through a little bit of an emotional roller coaster as it's up here at 98 I was like you know what I'm gonna punch him so I did I took 20 000 shares at 98 cents 99 Cents for the break of a dollar it goes up here to a dollar a a and it hits you see that topping tail hits a dollar a and then it was back down here like a dollar two uh and I was like uh I don't know so I take you know half of it or 75 percent of it off the table like a dollar three so that's you know 98 cents to a dollar three it's like 600 bucks on 20 000 shares but it's like a three cent winner uh then I add back at a dollar a and it goes into a halt here at a dollar eleven so I was like okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,well I'm up three cents for my dollar eight average it opens and hits a high right here of a dollar eighteen it goes up to a dollar twenty three I took my profit it dips down I added back 7 500 shares a dollar ten got a little exit up here a dollar twenty so kind of traded it in this range but I added back right here on this candle uh I think it was 15 000 shares might have been twenty thousand for the break through the highs and it dropped here and I stopped out at a dollar ten so I was up a little over 2 000 on vlon at my Peak which had me down 2500 on the day but then on that drop right there I gave back 1500 of it and I was like all right that's it I'm basically back to down four thousand and now I've even though I made 600 on vlon I turned commissions trading it so I'm like more or less I'm basically back to where I was before I even started trading it I mean I,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,okay I made a couple hundred bucks but not it's not significant at that point I was like you know what it's 9 45. I think the writing's on the wall call it so uh I called it and that's it 5000 read on the day not a fun way to start the week um obviously so closing that down the good news and there is some good news here um the good news is it's early in the week so early in the week is um you know there's a lot of time to recoup losses also good news it's only my second red day of the year that's that's really good news but both red days are Max loss I've had two red days this year but they're both Max loss this red day is a little smaller at five thousand it gives back what I made on Friday uh but I had a slow day on Tuesday or Thursday Wednesday and Thursday last week but last week was a good week um you know twelve thousand fourteen sixteen so it was like 20 000,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NWeH-uOyTyI,you know 21 000 a week that's not bad but of course gave back you know 20 of that today here um you know but I just kind of look at it as all right I gave back Friday's profit that's you know only one day backwards really not a big deal and it was good that I called it where I did because I don't think it would have gotten any better if I kept trading I think my next best chance at having a good trade is going to be tomorrow so I'll be back at it tomorrow bright and early and hopefully we have some better momentum because even though vlo n was good this is a little bit of a tricky scanner today and you know that was the market we had it's unfortunate that I caught that big loss on licn or whatever it was um that was unfortunate but you know look it happens so you know cut the loss move on and that's what I'm doing all right that's it for me I'll be back at it first thing tomorrow morning,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A, Warren Buffett and how to invest that is what it's all about today you can go by the words that people say and he says quite a few we're going to take a look at him and then we're going to go ahead and look at the actions that he actually does with his company I always tell people be careful what you hear what you read and everything else because at the end of the day actions speak louder than words Warren Buffett knows what he's doing he started I believe with a thousand and now he's worth billions so there is no argument that this man is one of the best investors in history but when it comes to how to invest in 2023 looking at what he says and what he's doing to me is screamed it was two different stories,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,so I'm going to give you the best stocks to buy now because they are the ones in my opinion that one of the best investors ever bought into and has in his portfolio did you know that if you take the top five stocks that Warren Buffett owns at Berkshire Hathaway it makes up 70 3 plus percent of his overall portfolio five stocks that to me is not well Diversified that is a little bit more risky and so I thought that was interesting I think a lot of people out there have to understand that when you hear what I'm going to teach you here when I teach you how to invest the Warren Buffett style is it the what he's saying or is it what he's doing that we do in this video what are we going to do there's no argument Warren Buffett is one of the top investors ever and I'm not here to dispute that I'm actually a big fan,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,but I do see a little bit of a little bit of difference between what he's saying and what he's doing so first things first let's get into how to invest Warren Buffett style and we'll say this we'll pull up an argue article that talked about what he discussed personally and this is Warren Buffett uh right here his is best investing advice invest in low-cost index funds consistently by buy an s p low-cost Index Fund he said I think it's the thing that makes the most sense I can agree with that I showed you buying vo I am absolutely showing you firsthand how that works out I'm gonna buy a hundred dollars a week for as long as I'm on here and I continue to do that and so we'll we'll see and stay the course that's what I'm showing you I'm going to continue to buy I'm not going to try to deviate I'm going to show you how dollar cost averaging Works in real life with real money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,and so we're doing that don't bet on individual stocks now this is where it gets you can argue we could argue right away in the beginning didn't you just say buy index funds didn't you say stay away don't bet on individual stocks if that's the truth on how to invest Warren Buffett is not doing exactly what he said is he he could take the billions of dollars he has at Berkshire Hathaway and just load him into an index fund and he could be set to go and of course that's not what he's doing I just told you he has over 70 percent of his money in just five stocks none of them are an index fund so pay attention to the next thing of course fees I brought up what am I buying and they could be cheaper out there I believe there are but I buy v-o-o that is the S&P500 Index through Vanguard .03 percent uh management fee that is dirt cheap one of the lowest out there I believe there are a few that beat I'm not sure which ones they are put in the comments down below what funds have lower than the Vanguard point zero three percent for the S&P500 if you know help us out community and take advantage of that and then of course start early and often as young as you are put as much money as you can as young as you can for as long as you can the magic of compounding he brings that up a lot and do your own research of course you're watching Youtube,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
J87kGYGDN6A,you're doing your research well I'm going to do as much research as I can pass the answers of the test over to you and you get to do the right thing based off of what we learn now and then he says keep a long-term view of course the longer in the market the more you should be able to go up to the market tends to go higher over the course of long term and invest in yourself of course make more money better yourself better everything so you can make more cash at work and invest more money now we have a lot of things I'm going to show you the stocks now and I showed you what he said I showed you that I think we can agree when it Warren Buffett how to invest 2023,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,I think that that holds very uh close to the heart if you will and how we probably should get through this a lot of people are calling for value stocks right now stocks that are making money a decent profit and of course check out the the dividends the p e ratios all these good things and if you could do that a lot of the analysts now are saying that's the route to go through because if we see a recession and that could be bad so when it comes to how to invest you want to make sure you're doing it the right way now of course we had a very wild very wild January and that's uh good news for all the Bulls out there before we get into the actual stocks he owns make sure you take advantage of the Weeble link down below this is one of the best things you do one dollar get you up to 12 stocks worth up to 30 600,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,it's the lowest I've received Link in the description take advantage of that and of course the MooMoo link I got this there put a hundred dollars in get five stocks worth up to two thousand a piece a thousand gets you 15 stocks worth up to 2 000 each so take advantage of them and it has a free stock screener then come on over and join us at the patreon even with the double Mo's on the screen we got good things going on now the first stock and I'm going to go over the percentage and then I'm going to show you his top 10 Holdings by the end of this video so the first of the best stocks to buy now if you were looking like I said remember this how to invest according to what he says,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,and I would argue how to invest according to what he does which one do you want to do what he does or what he says I personally like to go by actions I think he still contains some of the best stocks you can buy now and so the First on us on his portfolio the biggest holding for Warren Buffett is Apple stock that is it man I think he had and I think as we pull it up we'll pull it up at the end I believe it was around 40 percent he loaded up on Apple he obviously is a big fan and look at this this year year to date 20.74 outperforming the market that's what he's trying to do that's what he did so far with this stock but not all of his best stocks to buy now are going to be performing like that I pull up Bank of America that's next on his list that's the next biggest holding what's he have 6.18 up this year and we can take a look how's the S&P500 this year year to date 6.96 so it's actually underperforming a little bit,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,and we know as we looked at it apple is absolutely not performing up to that are way above that standard I should say uh so then we move to the next and I like this and look at the different sectors where he has his money year to date Chevron you guys know I have some of that and of course some other ones which we talk about on the channel so if you're not subscribed hit the Subscribe button I'll do the homework pass the answers the test over all right that's what it's about and here we go uh down one percent not too bad and I think energy rallies this year,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
J87kGYGDN6A,so I like his actions then another another Financial stock American Express of 21 he has Bank of America he has an energy attack and two uh financials and then we move into the last Coca-Cola consumers love buying these things right down five percent why is it down well what's going on well in my opinion and we're going to get into all the fun things after this one is that when people believe there's going to be a major recession it's a flight to safety stocks Coke is one of those safety stocks so people are now this year year to day so far as you can see in the markets believing that we're going to avoid it we're going to end up in a very good spot so when it comes to how to invest in 2023 if you believe there's no reset session you don't go into recession-proof socks you move into the higher risk moves because the market should take off and it did in January but lately this week we saw a lot of movement down what's going to happen well CPI comes out,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,and you know it changes everything we'll watch it and then of course uh what do the analysts think then we'll move into the other five stocks that Warren Buffett holds and how to invest in 2023 with a little bit of a different uh take on this so now as we take a look at the price predictions we start with apple and we can see what Wall Street thinks of this 15 upside potential up to 173 I thought it could hit 200 sometime in 2023. we'll see because if we hit a recession in my opinion it won't do it you can see what the analysts on Wall Street think and they put this all together on tip ranks I do got a link down in the description I really recommend this now Bank of America as well BAC 12 upside potential,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
J87kGYGDN6A,and you can see the analyst has some nice price Targets on it mostly green that's because financials usually do better than the overall market during a rate hike by the fed and then of course Chevron 11 upside potential based on what the analysts on Wall Street say that's decent the Chevron stock price prediction I thought we would see oil hit 100 a barrel that could push this up to that 192. and then American Express they have a downside on this though two percent which this is a little bit different than what we're used to uh I would expect the financials to continue but this really ran up big as you saw as I showed you a little bit ago and then Coke 3.99 it's got a little bit of a positive and we have a recession this thing could run up another I'd say 10 altogether if we have a recession that takes us into What mo tell us what he's owning,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,yeah if I can get this thing there we go this is what he was owning uh as of February 4th that was a a week ago uh Apple we got apple and you can see he owns 40 percent Bank of America 10 Chevron 8.1 percent American Express 7.7 and Coke 6.8 I believe that's over 70 I think it's 73 if I could add those numbers up right 73 and five stocks if you want to be like Warren Buffett and own similar portfolio go by actions or you can do what he says buy vo and be done with it or uh you know the S&P500 or whatever one you can find to match up to the S&P500 or go into what he's actually buying for me if I'm going to hear what he's saying I'm gonna do what he's doing not what he's saying I want to look and say he says buy this but he buys more apple he says do this and he buys Bank of America do this and he buys Chevron,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,I'm going to do what he's doing if I'm going to follow Warren Buffett Warren Buffett how to invest I believe in filing what Warren Buffett is doing on how to invest so uh when we look at 2023 this is what he has and then the other six I did not talk about crap Heinz yes 3.6 Occidental Petroleum another Energy company all right and you can see that here 3.4 percent Moody's uh 2.3 Taiwan semiconductor Manufacturing Company 1.6 byd an EV out of China one of the largest producing ones 1.3 percent now I know I think he was selling a couple of these shares here so for byd so you can get in there and see exactly what he is doing but now it comes down to this what do you think down below do we go voo if you had to pick one or the other not yeah I know there's a lot of other things we can do,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,but if you had to pick one or the other do you go with the portfolio he has here top five or top ten or do you believe in syncing your money into vlo only what would be your decision if you had to pick one follow his advice or buy into Berkshire Hathaway uh which one do you believe makes more sense and that's always the the million dollar question out there and uh we can take a look I'm gonna I didn't plan on doing this but you know what I'm gonna pull up something and I'm putting under the test right now we're going to take a look at Warren Buffett beat the S&P500 no I don't know the answer uh if he beat the S&P500 and we're gonna put in well let's we'll give him a chance we'll do one year five year than Max which is I think 30 years because I do believe he's in there for that Berkshire and wait till you see how expensive this stock is and we'll pull it up right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,so here you go take a look at that Berkshire Hathaway stock 472 how to invest in stocks how to invest in the stock market Warren Buffett will show you because now his Stock's worth 472 thousand dollars uh and I'm gonna guess he got some of the best stocks to buy out there in that portfolio Okay so one year it's up 1.49 or down one point four nine percent one year for the stock market down 7.43 Warren Buffett beat the S&P500 by around was it six percent yeah around six percent he did good if you own that stock you outperformed the market how about five years old Mo S P 549.71 Warren did you beat the s pi S&P500 54.33 so if you had Warren Buffett's stock you made an extra four percent over the last five years now the million dollar question this is always the one that I I like to watch this goes back 30 years uh I think it's 30 years let's see here more than that 39 40 years 40 years back uh Berkshire Hathaway was up 61 000 wow,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
J87kGYGDN6A,and then this one it goes back 40 years as well there you go and so that goes back February 25th just to make sure we're on the same thing May 3rd so it's off a little bit but this is up 61 000. how about the market 2 600. so did it pay did it pay to be in Berkshire Hathaway big time so if you had to choose which one you wanted to be in looking at the results that we have seen from Berkshire Hathaway I don't think it's close if I had to pick voo or go with Berkshire Hathaway I'm picking Berkshire Hathaway I'm gonna go ride the coattails of Warren Buffett and that's how you invest in 2023.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

6auT5dNCT9I,but some of you some of you who have been following the channel following the leading economic indicators you know what the path is you know it's screaming warning warning it's incoming and now today finally Elon Musk he must be watching the channel Elon don't be afraid to comment down below just say hi to the fans now in all seriousness he came out and said many of the things I have been telling you in preaching to get people ready for what is incoming and that is a recession for those that did not see I'll pull it up Elon Musk makes a dire prediction about the economy and folks it's not good remember this man owns so many different companies he has his ear to the ground listening to everything that's happening you put all the companies he has together and all the information that comes in about the global economy I don't think there's another person out there that can give you a better representation of what's happening so when Elon talks don't this look at Elon,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,like oh it's just one guy he's just giving his opinion he's telling you exactly how it is in real time this isn't lagging this isn't Ford leading economic indicators Elon is telling you how it is today and I I gotta tell you I still think he's he's out there he talked to Lawrence Summers Larry Summers AKA past treasury secretary for those that don't know who Larry is and Larry put out a post on Twitter today or I should say April 29th and it says if the Federal Reserve does what's necessary to contain inflation which I said they're going to they're going to I think a slow down slow down is likely to come he means recession let's be honest they don't like throwing out the recession word the odds of that happening sometime in the next 12 months I think are pretty good perhaps 70 percent he wouldn't even say the word recession it's almost like they're trained don't say recession you're going to scare the market and the markets drop if you tell them the truth don't tell them the truth everybody might be you know make good decisions then,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,and and so they continue to try to prop the markets up the best they can by avoiding the the difficult conversations but Elon oh Elon he's not one to get away from the truth and he says the FED data has too much latency mild recession is already here I agree I said Q2 I told you this back in Q3 and Q4 of 2022 that Q2 would be your recession we nailed it I'm telling you you're gonna find out after history looks and it'll say the recession hit in Q2 it's not just like it's not like the canary in the coal mine died one of the staunchest miners Credit Suisse died too and the cemetery is filling up fast uh further rate hikes will trigger severe recession here it is further rate hikes will trigger severe recession mark my words mark my words and what do we have coming up on May 3rd another rate hike,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,I can't agree more with Elon I've said it so many times that they have over done it with the ray hikes they are in constrictive territory they're trying to get break the back of inflation to the point that it happens overnight which when you do that which they can do what you're going to do is crush the economy to a point they have stimulus checks and you will see mark my words stimulus checks will be back and I believe they come back in 2024.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,you will see stimulus checks 2024 I believe because the election the recession and everything else that's what I'm calling for between Tesla starlink and Twitter I may have more real-time global economic data in one head than anyone ever think about all the information he gets between those companies I'm with them on this I think it's absolutely major so that leads us to the next question how can we become rich with the recession in 2023 if we know and we follow past historical data and we look to see what's exactly is going on what should happen during a bear Market with a recession in it now we've had 12 I believe since the 40s and since we had 12 bear markets and now we're in the 13th with a recession in them if we have a recession in this one which in my mind we're already in it but officially it's not so what has,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,the last 12 bear markets done when they had a recession that did they bottom before the recession or during the recession or post recession all 12 bottomed during the recession not before not a one bottom before the recession all right and so people who are telling me we have Bottom now in October I absolutely 100 percent disagree absolutely and I've got to tell you not once in the last 12 bear markets have we bought them before the recession so everybody telling me no it's a it's a bull market tell me why below what in the comments why do you believe fundamentally fundamentally not just because technically this or technically that fundamentally you tell me are earnings increasing are they're not going to constrict moving forward credit's expanding not constricting quantitative easing is happening not quantitative what is your Catalyst for this massive bull cycle to start I know what needs to happen we need to follow the tracks of the past and for those who have been with me over at the patreon you guys know this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,and if you guys would like to follow along with this I have the link down in the description new stocks added to portfolios I've been loading up you need to see what I've been researching and all this good stuff you can come on over and join folks I have the link down below become a member today I'm going to be loading up tomorrow on new stocks and selling some of the ones that are up from the latest rally I believe we're going to go ahead and see the market collapse back down to 36 3 500. if that is the case and we file a history we don't just you know oh I'm gonna my gut feeling,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,no I'm following the data leading economic indicators you got a mind like Elon warning us mark my words he knows that everybody sees this post he knows what he's saying and he is trying to help out everyone he is literally giving us the answers to the test before the test the question is how many people will actually follow his advice and understand that recession is coming and that we need to prepare at for it as investors how many people will actually listen or are they going to just put their head in the sand and listen to all the the the news people that want us to keep the markets propped up keep spending put yourself in debt record debt and credit cards uh student loans are coming back don't worry about it record debt and credit cards well we still have some savings left from the stimulus checks from 2020 2021 whenever they were oh yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,but that's going to be gone within 12 months we know student loans come back this August we know that they cut food stamps which was a major hit to the economy because now they got spent more money they were spending on goods and services on food things are getting ugly folks and unemployment will start to go crazy high and I think that's going to be bad right now you're seeing a lot of upper management getting hit and I think it works its way down to the front line workers sooner than later so folks it's not going to be pretty now what else are we seeing out there well I gotta tell you you know how you get rich in the 2023 recession you listen to what you're being told here in terms of the big companies speaking to us the biggest online retailer in the US is warning of cautious spending this is Amazon Amazon telling us that things are getting a little bit tight out there and it's going to get tighter I just told you why,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,but then I wanted to bring this to your to your attention people ask me I'll just go with some of the best hedge funds this and that keep in mind between 2011 to 2020 we had one of the biggest bull cycles in history long huge massive money made this is the average hedge fund return 5.48 all the way down annually and this is the S&P500. I'm going to tell you something right now you are better off on average investing in the S&P500 and just letting it go then you are thinking because you're with a high cost hedge fund you're in a high cost managed fund you're in somebody else's fund they might charge a ton of money to be in it like .77 management fee which is ridiculous high or you can put yourself in something like voo .03 percent it matches up the S&P500 it doesn't get too scared and sell everything during the bad days it doesn't go and go crazy buying on fomo it just is the S&P500,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
6auT5dNCT9I,it does what it does and you can see the returns I want you to take a look at this and understand how big a difference is these are not one year did a hedge fund average better better than the S&P500 and did you know to add to this over the long term ninety percent of hedge funds I'm talking 10 to 20 years out cannot beat the S&P500 they have too high a management fees and after you you know you see them driving around in their brand new cars flying on their Jets how do you think they pay for that they use it with your money they charge you too much,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
6auT5dNCT9I,and then they can't even beat the S&P500 you can do an an easy ETF for bonds an easy ETF for the S&P500 set it and let it go and you will outperform an over 90 percent of hedge funds in the long run keep that in mind I'm talking Harvard Yale Princeton all right you're better off just doing that and that's the truth that's the absolute truth they charge so much in fees it destroys their returns now if they didn't charge any fees at all some of them would be doing well but they charge those fees look at the different ETFs out there if they're charging 0.7 0.77.8.5 anything above 0.1 you're paying a ton of money for those returns and then I challenge you to go out 20 years and compare it to the S&P500 did they out beat the S&P500 90 will say no they couldn't beat it and so if that's the case I'm not rolling the dice for one year the best way to get rich with this recession is probably looking at the S&P500.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
6auT5dNCT9I,or if you really want to have some fun you know there's leverage products which I've been doing if we know the S&P500 if we have a major sell-off in a recession and we hit new lows the new bull cycle could end up making bank and that's one of the things I wanted to show you now keep in mind a few things before we get to it how to get rich with a recession I'll tell you this uh right here you can see and we got and I'll say in my mind vo one of the best stocks to buy now and that's where you can dial across average through which I've been showing you out to bring that up again in one of the next videos uh but what is the average rate of return last 20 years 8.19 and that's from 2002 to 2022.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
6auT5dNCT9I,then the average rate of return from since 2012 12.84 you can see and then since it's had 1957 they went to 500 stocks 11.88 average return you can just put your money in the S&P500 continue to do that and you should be able to crush long term against hedge funds Harvard jail Princeton all these big time Wall Street I went to the best universities in the world and I graduated first and at the end of the day you're going to end up beating them just getting in the S&P500 so just keep that in mind folks now what I want to show you let's go back and take a look at some things we had the 2008 crash right here right and when it crashed if you were able to get down there and buy in I want you to see this 500 gain right but what happens if you would have bought something like XP x uh we got a XL I believe it is yep there's the bull and we go out and we see how long it goes back to 2008.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
6auT5dNCT9I,we know the S&P500 went up 500 percent how much did this go up did it go up fifteen hundred percent or close eight thousand six hundred and eighty four I thought it goes up three times Mo well it's supposed to but this thing went up eight thousand six hundred percent over that 12-year period now if we just go out to 2020 before the crash you can see it's up fifty eight hundred percent my point is can you use leverage products if you're looking for more risk you can but remember I I'll show you this there's a cost to it and when it drops look at this this was down 75 percent of your money gone in a matter of days so when you when it's running it's running when it's dropping it is dropping but check this out from those days on if you bought in look how crazy this is 600 and something percent in a year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,wow all right folks that was what I was talking about in terms of how to get rich are you looking for the slow and steady get rich slow with Mo are you trying to roll the dice take some chances I got I'm trying to take some chances now just so you know hit the like And subscribe if you want to follow along come over to the patreon you'll see what I'm talking about and of course uh it for those who wanted to take advantage and get some free stocks I do have that down there as well we're putting these at the end here for a little bit the ads and you can see the MooMoo 15 free stocks all you got to do is put 100 bucks in you get five free stocks put a thousand you get 15 each stock can be worth up to two thousand dollars a piece so get those and then of course they have the free charting which I love take a look at where we're at right now with the overall looking at this chart you can see where we're at,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6auT5dNCT9I,and we are getting close to that 90 97.5 percentile means we are very close to overbought territory everything seems to you know you're seeing it roll up but I think we're hitting that top where it's going to pull back now and that's my opinion on this all right and when we were sold off here I said we got oversold here it bounced back up oversold here bounce back up but I gotta tell you here's where I thought we were overbought and we did drop down now we had a push up and I think we're ready for that next leg down and I think we're there and so if you like this chart and you want the free stocks hit the MooMoo down below,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

alsU4rXLN6c,hi everyone welcome back if you're new to the channel I am stockmo and I'm going to tell you this today we are bringing you something special I went out and found five of the biggest investors out there we're talking the biggest names in the business and I took their number one Holdings we put them all together in one video here to show you the top five stocks to buy now for 2023 based on what they're holding ending this year in other words if they're putting this much money we're talking billions of dollars into these plays we should expect that they believe they will do very very well in 2023 so this is going to be a very interesting one who are the five people I picked you'll see here in a second and of course what are their largest Holdings so think in your head who are the top five investors out there you'd like to see we'll see if we hit them or not uh now if you haven't done I'm starting the new 2023 portfolio hit the link down below for patreon come over and join us and I'm starting a short portfolio as well the patreon link is down there or you can join through YouTube and become a channel member hit the join button down below and hit Tesla cat supporter or higher you will get access to the portfolios you'll get access to the private Discord you can do it that way or the patreon come on over and join us and then of course take advantage of the MooMoo link uh all you got to do for this of course hit the link down below and you will get access to this you get 10 free stocks for a hundred dollars a thousand gets you 20 plus the entry and they can be worth up to uh 20 000 here or forty thousand here depending on the luck you got now let's get into the best stocks to buy we can say the best stocks to invest in in 2023 based on what they are doing this is going to be an interesting take on this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
alsU4rXLN6c,and uh what I'm talking about is this we'll start with Charlie Munger stock portfolio I went right in there and it's no surprise anybody that knows who he is he works with Warren Buffett uh they've been working together all their lives and what you see right now and let's take a look at it boom Bank of America this is it his biggest holding what I'm going to do with each of these now is that we are going to go ahead and take a look at it see the size I got take a look at the analysts out there what they think of a price prediction over the next 12 months you you can make up your own mind like I said I'm not telling you what to buy and sell I'm just showing you what the big dogs out there have I do have this in my portfolio,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
alsU4rXLN6c,and so I don't know it's not doing as well as I would like it to but with the FED raising rates of course we know that usually financials outperform as the rates go higher the financials can charge more and more interest on any money they loan out they do not pay out higher in terms of uh not dividends but I was going to say in interest to those who saved so the Savers aren't getting as much but those who want more money to borrow they're going to pay out the nose for it and usually the financials do well so you know uh that Charlie Munger loves Bank of America's biggest holding now we'll take a look at it though and see how he's done over the last year in turn I don't you know like I said they they buy throughout the years and they can build up this holding over time but I just want to show year to date of how they have done and you can see down about 29.88 and it is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
alsU4rXLN6c,and we'll take a look at the S&P500 that's what we're going to compare all these to it is absolutely underperforming the S&P500 right now so that's kind of the number I'm looking at 17.97 for that one all right so then we'll take a look at the tip ranks at the end but now we move into Who ah Warren Buffett who's his number one star what's his number one stock right here value of the stake 131 million in apple all right so we can come over and say apple 131 million Warren Buffett biggest stock so you got Charlie Munger with Bank of America we know that Warren Buffett also has a very large stake in Bank of America so you can count that between them but this is it right here 21.89 down for the year it's trailing the S&P500. so as we look at Apple you can see it's down 21 at 0.89 so it's been a rough year uh for those of with me you know I had an option on this we doubled our value sold out of that and took our profits,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
alsU4rXLN6c,but I still believe apple is going to hit 200 and uh hopefully sometime in 2023 I thought the summer before we were going to see a recession now that I think we're going to see a recession that could be pushed to the tail end of 2023 everything once we have a recession hit everything kind of gets ugly and we're gonna have to wait and see maybe we don't have a recession maybe we do now the next person I had to go out there I wanted to go with Arc of course Kathy what I know a lot of people follow her so I wanted to pick her biggest one and it was it comes to no surprise to me which is her biggest Tesla Tesla amount I own right now 731 million dollars and as we take a look at Tesla and how they have done you can see that it is down 55.23 this year so over the last 12 months almost 12 months it has actually gotten hammered,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
alsU4rXLN6c,and so she has taken a bath on this 55 down a lot of stocks rolling down and then the next of the best stocks to buy now the best stocks to invest in I went with Bill Ackman we wanted to see what he had out in his portfolio to go with the big name so we can see everything that's going on in the markets see where the big people are putting their money I like this one this one I I really like it has it in Lowe's and you can see out here uh the value of this I believe we had three zeros on there 1.9 billion dollars in lows so we come out and take a look at Lowe's stock how is this one done down 21 so every stock I'm showing you from the biggest Holdings uh from all these people if they held it for the entire year would be down more than the S&P500 at this given moment I like Lowe's solid stock to me personally,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
alsU4rXLN6c,I like it's a little still a little pricey 19.78 p e ratio I don't have the four uh PE ratios up but just taking a look at this you can see there's always opportunity this thing was up there about uh 261. without a 201 lost about 30 percent we'll keep an eye on it and then the last one we're going to take a look at and this one was kind of surprising to me George Soros uh rivian Automotive is his biggest one and we come over here and see it's a half a billion dollars 538 million dollars and then we take a look at rivian and 73 per 73.43 down Way Beyond what the market is okay uh the S&P500 so all these folks would have just put all their money in an S&P500 ETF as their largest holding they would outperform their largest Holdings now if they held that for the entire I don't know uh exactly I didn't go through every purchase they made because I don't have that,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
alsU4rXLN6c,but I just wanted to show you now to give you an idea though are these stocks the best stocks to buy now for 2023 are these the best to invest in in 2023 that's the question so now I come out and we take a look at the animals all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
alsU4rXLN6c,and this tip ranks link got it down below in the description I do highly recommend it uh as you can come over here and see this forty dollars and twenty three cents 24 upside potential by the experts coming out and you guys can see the experts here a couple of them over the last week 40 38 36 and so as we go into that one that was Bank of America Charlie Munger then we move into Apple which we know is Warren Buffett he had they have this at a 180 now boy this is drop through the look at this it has dropped uh now uh taking a look at that that has an upside potential 26.80 uh not bad and you can see where some of the the bigger folks out there have you can see over the last seven days 200 down to 175.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
alsU4rXLN6c,then we move on to who is next Kathy Wood with Tesla and Tesla right now 63.88 upside potential they see it hitting 300 or roughly 300 by the end of 12 months and as we go down you can see some of the names out there who are looking at this stock all right and then the next one out there Lowe's uh Lowe's who's the lows Bill Ackman with Lowe's you can see this one uh 17.52 percent I wouldn't think this was going to be the most wild one out there but I do like this one just to tell you I think it has potential and finally finally want to take a look at this one we had George Soros and you can see that rivian Automotive stock forecasts 86 percent upside potential and you can see some of the people out there looking a lot of green out there not too many people think that we should be shorting it or anything like that and there's a lot of side potential,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
alsU4rXLN6c,so when you look at this and I'm not telling you to run out and ride your coattails I'm just showing you these are some of the well-known investors in the world,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
alsU4rXLN6c,and I wanted to take a look and pick their number one plays in all their portfolios buy actions not by words by actions because wherever they put the most money in my opinion is where they believe they're going to get the most reward we got some pretty risky plays in there as well as I would say some more conservative ones you know Lowe's and Bank of America obviously to me are some pretty conservative ones and once you get into the EV space with Tesla and rivien and uh of course uh what do we got apple apple to me is not that risky either so a couple of them going with the the lesser of the risk if you will some of the other ones going with more risk now I do like getting out there and looking at these remember you if you look at Warren Buffett he got in the Occidental Petroleum and if you wrote his coattails on that that thing is up huge I think it was a hundred and something percent for uh the year which is just wild this thing is just rolling,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
alsU4rXLN6c,and so it is important to look at these now over at MooMoo they do give you the institutional tracker which allows you to see what these folks are buying and selling as they file their quarter lease and that's to me it's important so when they're taking up new positions I think it's always interesting to go out there and do our due diligence on it and see if it makes sense for our portfolio but if it's somebody out there who is selling everything and they're getting out and that's that's also important because it's a large sign they might say hey the Market's look good but they're selling everything remember actions speak louder than words and so file the actions of the Bulls the whales and you might be able to save your own portfolio uh some pain and if you're following along with some of those big buys from these folks and you're wondering what's going on uh you might even be able to get yourself some extra games we don't know like I said no one has a crystal ball not even them but they do have connection and a lot of money out there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
alsU4rXLN6c,and so I had to turn a blind eye to them is foolish in my opinion we can watch them don't they need we don't blindly follow them but definitely pay attention to the sectors they're investing in see if we can find ourselves a little piece of that pie either by that company or another one that we think is overlooked now if you haven't done it yet come on over check out my new portfolio the 2023 recession portfolio and the short portfolio I'm going to be starting the next week or two you can do that by signing up a patreon or here on YouTube by becoming a channel member at the Tesla cat level or higher and don't forget to take advantage of the MooMoo link down below get yourself 10 free stocks worth up to 20 grand just for deposit 100 bucks I appreciate you stopping by let's get out there and make some money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

U4a7mWvOaso,but I you know I make these videos I always have a lot of people come out and they say mo tell us about these things ahead of time I always do and so this is going to be another one of them things where I share with you you where I'm seeing the warning signs and what I think is going to happen over the next just couple of weeks I don't think it's going to take that long for this to happen and yes you can make a fortune if you do the Right Moves and these things happen there's no guarantee I never tell you what the buy and sell just what I'm doing but I am going to share with you what I'm doing all right and so we're going to try to see if we can make as much money as possible off of this now before we get into it of course make sure you take advantage of the MooMoo link down below click on it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,you'll get up to 15 free stocks worth up to thirty thousand dollars put 100 bucks in five free stocks thousand fifteen free stocks that is what I'm talking about and they can be worth up to 2 000 a piece for each stock I also have the patreon link down below if you haven't been following the brand new portfolios what are you waiting for the recession portfolio is doing well if you want to see the winners come on over check it out and of course I do share these online eventually we go through all of them there's not enough time to do everything I'm I'm doing over there in one video so it does take me some time but this is your chance of follow along and we got the high risk for those looking for some of the leveraging and some of that extreme stuff that's what I'm doing too,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,and I continue to put money into that one that's going to be a lot of fun walk as we go through this year we'll see how it makes out but that links down in the description private Discord we got the members only videos you get it all now so take advantage of that all right so what do we want to talk about here U.S stocks could fall 10 percent as pain trade takes hold before bouncing back later in the year this you continue to see these kind of headlines and it's for a good reason this is we we see these right and you're like what's going on Bank of America is offering some advice now you know we got JP Morgan Goldman Sachs all these Bank of America now coming out and it's offering some advice on when things will get easier and it will get easier you're almost out of the you're almost out of the woods,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,and we're almost to that next bull market where we're making bank and that's what it's about the bad news is things might get hard first even after the global stocks have seen a strong long start to the year and you can see that a team of them all right and they can say on Friday this is on Friday all right stocks could fall 10 percent from current levels before rallying late this year as investors start to expect a less aggressive policy stands from the fed and they do so that's saying it could get down to about what 3 600 that's a 10 from where we're at and then they believe here it is they see the position to trade between 3642 but expects the former ahead of the latter so they expect to get down about 3 600 they expect to see the S&P500 get down to 3 600. remember my base case my base case is that we see the S&P500 hit 3600. it's gonna do it in my mind it would be it would be good news if it doesn't all right if we see a bull market start somehow someway fantastic,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
U4a7mWvOaso,but all the data I'm showing you everything that I'm seeing screams based off historical data in the financial situations that have happened in the past that we are absolutely going to see a downturn and we're absolutely going to see a recession and this would be one of the only times in history that we didn't with all the the variables coming out that would be very very very rare but a good a good thing so I we would make money and I would make money we'd all make money but I don't see that happening and so if you're not prepared for a recession expect that 10 to 20 percent drop from current level I absolutely believe if we don't have a recession we will still hit the 3600 level and I believe Bank of America's spot on there 3600,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
U4a7mWvOaso,we're going to go down there that's without in my opinion without a recession if we have a recession I fully expect to see the S&P500 drop down to the let's say the 3300 to 2900 level an additional 10 so say 20 down if we have a recession from current levels that's right we could get down there between the 29 to 3300 and at that time I I would expect a lot of different things the vix would be spiking you would see the the fear and greed index all the way down to extreme fear I would be switching over to small caps I would be switching to growth stocks I'd be switching to Tech at that time and there's no calling the bottom,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
U4a7mWvOaso,but you know what if you dial a cost averaging as I slowly rotate over you will be just fine moving forward eventually it would rebound and the FED would have to go to quantitative easing and that's what I think happens by the end of this year I think a lot of these analysts believe that as well and then once we're down there if no recession 3600 is where I'm going to be doing my thing if we have that recession I'm going to be waiting until we get down to the 3300 levels all right so if you would like to see everything like I said you can join as a channel member here on YouTube and I share the portfolios buys and sells and private Discord here as well for Tesla cast supporters or higher I have the join button should be down there pinned to the comment or in the description all right and so we move forward we say okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,what else could mess up rile the stock market and this is one that I'm going to bring to you way ahead of time way ahead of time here you go and for those filing along I remember this in past years it doesn't matter you know you got Democrats Republicans the House Republicans prepare emergency plan for breaching debt limit all right so here's the thing about the debt limit if they don't pay if we if you have a U.S default that would be absolutely crushing to the stock market and no one ever wants to see a U.S default on the bills they pay all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,and so we're not going to have one they do they always find a way not to have one but the longer they stretch and the longer it goes to that break of going over the cliff and possibly having one you will see the stock markets starting to pay attention because what becomes an event that won't happen as you get closer to it and now there's some odds of it actually happening when there never were you see the market pricing that in and once it starts to price that in or once there's effect from certain things not being paid anymore services not being paid so they're not doing them anymore money's taken out of the the economy things start dropping then you start to see the stock market coming back down and it gets hit hard I remember Past Times this has happened so that day when could that be I believe it's June I believe from everything I'm reading June would be that time when the emergency procedures and everything the money that they're doing to pay everything starts to run out,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,and then they got to make tough choices and tighten the belt and figure out what they're going to do and so that day could come and if that day comes with the Democrats and Republicans can't figure it out that is when you need to be prepared now it kind of comes all together remember I said I expect to see a recession some a downturn in the stock market that is only five months from now remember five months from now that'll go very quickly it'll be here before you know it Summer's going to be here very quickly and so as I watch that I keep that in my mind,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,and then I showed you this before big Bank set aside four billion dollars for a recession that is their base case now their base case and we're talking big time Banks JP Morgan and and I just want to make sure people saw this Bank of America JPMorgan Wells Fargo Citigroup they set a lot of money aside why because their base case now is that we're going to have a recession and remember what I said about the S&P500 based off prior data based off prior situations of these recessions we can expect the stock market to drop 10 to 20 percent if if there's a recession most likely 20 percent if it's just a mild real you know quick we're through it maybe not quite 20,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
U4a7mWvOaso,but I still think we'll get close I still think we'll get close and so all you know and before you think wow what's going on the fed's causing this they're doing it on purpose they just can't come out and say that they got to break the back of inflation and in doing that they got to slow the economy down could slow it down to a point that causes a recession if it brings inflation under control long term that'll be a good thing I get that you know because that makes everything work right and but the short term six months nine months 12 months is painful for a lot of Americans so what is happening the state governments bring out extended unemployment benefits the federal and state governments bring out stimulus checks yes a huge round of stimulus checks would happen we haven't had a recession I think the last three major recessions had stimulus checks this could be a fourth and so I'm watching that as well so put all that together that's what I'm seeing another sign that I don't like,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,and I absolutely hate this one fear and greed index look at this thing it's now up to it's middle agreed we're closing in on Extreme greed I can tell you when I was watching the um the ethereum and crypto this weekend just blowing up having a great couple of weeks which we're going to talk about here and then you can see the equities the NASDAQ up I think over the week like you know six percent it was a wild time and what do we get for we get extreme greed everybody gets fomo it's time to go it's gone let's go I want to jump in when it goes up everybody wants to Pile in but it can turn quick it can turn on a dime one bad note one bad thing this thing drops Energy starts spiking things drop right now I put a lot of this on the weakening dollar that's actually good for the stock market uh it should continue to be weakening through this year I absolutely expect the dollar to be weakening all the way through 2023 for those wondering I don't do currency I don't do that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,but I'm telling you this if I did I would be betting that the dollar will continue to weaken I had one of the best years ever in 2022. if the fed's gonna pivot that should weaken the dollar all right so that's where I see that I'll see it I don't see it going overboard but at the same time I do expect to see it drown now let's take a look at the oil you can see that's starting to go higher my Synovus energy cve and Chevron CVX are doing very well and I got that portfolio for the recession which I do have some Diversified ETFs in there for energy so you can come over and check that out and then look at all these different things you can see these the inversion between these is just outstanding,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
U4a7mWvOaso,it's so high it's like a 40-year high screaming recession put all this together folks and that is why I am absolutely nervous about it now take a look at this you got ethereum going through the roof twenty percent up in four weeks one month twenty percent up how about Bitcoin Mo 19.5 7 up when you're starting to see these riskier assets starting to take up I showed you uh in the last video how we had the Russell 2000 up I think it was four point something per percent over the last week you're seeing small caps run you're seeing these riskier assets run I'm telling you you see the fear gauge going up and it goes up into the greed gauge and it's getting closer to extreme greed and then I still believe earnings are going to be affected in a very negative way we're going to find out so I'm just telling people be on your toes we're not through the darkness we're not through all the woods yet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
U4a7mWvOaso,but we can make a lot of money on the downturn if it happens I got that high high risk on which I keep adding to them dollar cost averaging in to help reduce a little bit of the risk and I got the recession one which should easily outperform outperform the S&P500 if we go into a recession we'll we'll find out we'll find out soon enough all right now that's the big update for today if you haven't done it get that join me over to patreon you can follow along with the stocks take it to the next level I don't know what you're waiting for we got some fantastic plays over there and see what we're making money with and of course come on over and get those MooMoo stocks linked down below Weeble as well both of them deposit 100 bucks for either we will give you 12 stocks worth up to 30 000 and moomo will give you five stocks worth up to ten thousand for a hundred and if you put a thousand it'll give you 15 stocks worth up to thirty thousand so take advantage of both of those I appreciate you stopping by let's get out there and make some money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

CAE2_cpB-ic,so I always learned young that money is not necessarily something to be scared of that it's not something that shouldn't be talked about so what was the biggest piece of advice that your grandfather told you about investing he told me to believe in the companies that I invest in so not only invest in just for making money but to actually invest at least at the age I'm at and stuff that I'm interested in stuff that I'll actually follow if I'm not literally invested in what I'm investing into then why do it cool thank you so much what's your name age and what's he do Tyler gammares I am 29 I am a recruiter for Tech do you have any advice for people that also want to do that the more outgoing you are the better your offer going to be definitely learn the things if you're in healthcare learn Healthcare terms if you're in Tech like myself learn Tech terms learn what people are using it helps a lot,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CAE2_cpB-ic,so I'm an introvert what can I learn to make myself a better salesperson I think a big part of it is knowing what you're talking about if you're going to be introverted which is fine if you know the material really well then it helps to kind of bring that part out of you because you go no no that's wrong or those things become second nature just because you know the answer how do you invest your money or what do you do with your money I'm a blue chip guy okay all the tech stuff okay uh Microsoft everything in that space Apple Tesla all the things that are the bigger biggest movers and shakers I try to hop in just because it's near and dear to my heart I'm in Tech so it makes it a little more fun a little bit of Amazon just because I don't think it's going anywhere how much do you spend per month on food probably two thousand bucks wow my girlfriend loves to eat I love to eat so it's food's worth it yeah it's like experience and memories of food yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CAE2_cpB-ic,exactly cool thank you so much so what's your name agent what you do my name is Sammy I'm 24 and I'm a baker what's your favorite thing to bake cakes Sammy G bakes what do you do with your money well I have a Charles Schwab account a couple mutual funds I have a little bit invested in crypto what's your uh investing approach like are you long term short-term long-term I mean I did put my money into like the shiba inu coin but I didn't make any money off of that so long term for sure if you have a thousand dollars right now to put into anything what would you put in gosh I don't know I would call up my boyfriend and ask him when did you get started investing 2020 during the pandemic I was like damn I really should do something with my money are there any good resources that you've learned investing from this is probably really bad advice,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CAE2_cpB-ic,but Twitter I just like really follow like fintuit and just like what like the community is generally talking about is how I stay up to date so there you have it asking strangers how they manage and build their wealth through investing I think all the people we talked to today had really interesting things to share I think it's always super fun to see what other people do with their money now and say thank you to MooMoo for making this video possible if you guys do want to get some free stocks I encourage you to use my exclusive link down below it's only for a limited time they're one of my favorite brokerages they have such great tools that make trading easy for anyone and yeah if you want to be a better investor definitely take advantage of all the free tools that they have if you guys enjoyed the video make sure to hit that like button and also subscribe for more content just like this we do a ton of videos about personal finance investing in entrepreneurship thank you for your time I'll see you in the next video peace [Music] thank you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo, how do you invest your money what's your favorite personal finance book what's the best investment you've ever made what's your biggest failure I've started a lot of YouTube channels and I would say half of them have failed so I probably have started 20 25 channels what's your biggest piece of advice for someone that wants to become wealthy what do you hate spending money on water hey guys so in today's video we are talking with personal finance content creators to get their advice on investing saving money making money as well as any business advice they have we're talking about some of the biggest names in the personal Appliance World I think that we're going to learn a lot from what they have to say behind me is the 2022 BMW M8 competition Grand Coupe this is one of the fastest order sedans in the world with 617 horsepower and a 0 to 60 time in just 2.7 seconds expect out in black with a really cool Brown orange interior and yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,I've just been the sucker for BMWs my entire life and thank you to Cleo for making this video possible I'm so excited to talk to today's guest let's go so what's your name Age and what do you do my name is Humphrey Yang I'm 34 years old and I make YouTube content Tick Tock content and Instagram content about Finance I am Sebastian I'm in my 30s and I have a YouTube channel called past sebi I'm Nate I'm 24 and I make some videos online my name is Queenie my age is 26 and create a I create videos about personal finance but also like money hacks my name is Seth Godwin I am 28 years old and I do Tick Tock full-time my name is Vincent I am 27 years old,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,and I create content on YouTube and some other platforms what makes you so passionate about personal finance didn't grow up with a lot of money parents are immigrants so blue collar workers and they never made that much money so after college I went to finance and I realized like Financial education is really bad in the US I'm trying to do as much as I can to close that wealth Gap by making Finance more fun more more easy to understand and more entertaining I'm passionate about personal finance because I almost went bankrupt about five years ago and that scared the hell out of me because I didn't know what the heck was going on I didn't know why all of this was happening didn't realize that if you defaulted on some credit cards that it was like one of the worst things you could do I decided that I wanted to educate people on stuff that I wish that I would have known at 18 so that people didn't fall into the same traps that I did or if they had fallen into the same traps how to get out of it I grew up in a single parent family my dad was like a single like stay at home dad he didn't work,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,and he had passive income and that was kind of interesting and I guess like that's what made me interested in it I just wanted to share like the things that I've learned along the years because I know that maybe in some families in some households like people don't really talk about money you know yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,how do you invest your money I think the biggest way that I'm investing my money is probably in my business which is content creation I would say every paycheck that I get I put a small percentage of it into the S&P500 which is just an index fund I also take some of that money and invest it in alternative things like cryptocurrency and real estate I'm trying to invest more into my own business so trying to reinvest and trying to like make my business grow bigger so that I can take a bigger profit from it later and then lastly I just also sit in a bunch of cash right now because I'm trying to save up for possibly a home or a bigger real estate purchase I definitely diversify a bit but most of it uh it's a lot of trading on I thought what type of things you trade like bonds uh Commodities what's the financial secret that changed your life I would say understanding leverage so either leveraging Capital through you know people do this with like real estate for example leverage through other people which Karl Marx would not be a fan of but like hiring employees and then but just understanding leverage was a really big uh factor that was a game changer a lot of the most successful people that you'll meet in life they are always taking on asymmetric risk they're okay taking like 2 straight L's in a row so that 21st time might produce you know a 1 to 100 right and that makes up for their all their losses asymmetric risk asymmetric upside taking a lot of shots but knowing that one will probably return much more than the sum of all your losses uh the 30 percent rule on credit like the the 30 utilization is really not a great guideline you really want to keep it below 10 your utilization below 10 that changed everything when it came to my score and getting approved for things you can tell people what that means,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,yeah so if you have like a thousand dollar credit limit generally people say you can use up to 30 percent of that which would be three hundred dollars but if you want to maximize your credit and get the best out of out of what credit offers you keep that reporting balance below 10 that a lot of rich people are cheaper than you think I think a lot of people assume like if you're rich that you like just blow your money and there are people who do that right like lottery winners are pretty much the prime example of that where I think statistically most of them who win the lottery end up losing all of their money within two years rich people are pretty Savvy of their money especially if they came up with less money or no money so today's sponsor is a company I know you'll love because it will save you a lot of money yes Finance creators they keep it real with you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,oh that's very true I've spent so much money in the last month building out this office wow cool has an attitude I love it signing up takes just two minutes and you guys can use the link in the description to get started again the link to clear will be down below and I really encourage you to check it out and now back to the video what type of business should people start if they want to make money one thing that I think still is like a growing space is content creators especially the first business I would say anything like Consulting because you have really low overhead so service businesses low overhead uh don't try to start like an e-commerce business where you have like tons of products and you're not drop shipping them because you have a lot of costs up front and it might not work out so go with service business whatever they're actually passionate about like people can smell BS from a mile away so if you're selling something like if if I were to start selling nail polish it's a great business model,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,but I don't give a crap about it people are going to be able to see this is just a money grab are there any free things that people should do to increase their chances of becoming wealthy dude YouTube is probably the best resource out there to learn anything I think putting yourself in a position to get lucky so there's a lot of people who have a very self-defeatist mindset and like I get it because it's tough but a lot of people will be like I did not grow up in the right family therefore I have no chance therefore it's not worth trying and in reality like if you talk to a lot of content creators that we know a lot of them actually struggled their way out of like pretty bad positions like whether it's addiction whether it's poverty if they grinded,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,and they worked hard finding a mentor asking questions being curious is like the ultimate hack in life because as long as you're curious you can look stuff up online there's free resources at the library you can read read and learn anything on YouTube as long as you stay curious about a subject and you dive deep into it ask the right people make some connections you can be successful go to the public library nobody goes to a library anymore I mean I go all the time and I just read books like I read a book a week so yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,three things I would say watch Charlie's YouTube videos and get a better understanding of personal finance all the information is online you just gotta Google it what's the best investment you've ever made in myself taking the plunge quitting my job and going all in on YouTube actually buying YouTube courses funny enough like I learn a lot through YouTube courses and creating better YouTube videos out of the courses that I've made yeah probably books I've read so many personal finance books when you're younger you should be spending it on things that you can enjoy while you're young because maybe one day you won't be able to do those things maybe one day you won't be able to go skydiving scuba diving with sharks and things like that what's your biggest failure I try to save my mistakes not as failures but as like lessons and learning it is a bit cheesy but the fact that you're even doing those things means that you're pushing your boundaries so is it really a mistake uh I don't know I think it is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,yeah I've started a lot of YouTube channels and I would say half of them have failed so I probably have started 20 25 channels I think those don't work um I read the market wrong I thought there was a bigger need for it or a bigger demand than there actually was not starting soon enough I'm usually the type of person that thinks a lot before they do something and I would I would say in my experience anytime you can act fast and learn from those failures that's usually better than just waiting around for six months and then doing it what's a traditional personal finance rule that you always break I don't have a 401k I personally never did it because I viewed it as taught tying up my liquidity so if I was working at a job I was making 100K but you know let's say every paycheck 800 was going to my 401k that's 800 that I don't have to immediately deploy today,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,and I knew that I was a little bit more entrepreneurial hopefully in 50 years I make way more than what my ending 401K balance will be stop buying coffee or whatever at Starbucks it's like the 80 20 Rule and then like 20 of the things you buy are driving like 80 of the expenses and that coffee is not part of that 20 if like a three dollars cup of coffee gives you like increases your happiness by like X percent then do you value your increase in happiness with three dollars um so you have to also value that and see how that plays in with the cost what do you hate spending money on clothes I'm 100 fine spending money on experiences because I know I'm never gonna forget that but outfits and stuff like that I don't like how it makes me feel like there's wear and tear and then I'll get like a stain on it and it'll ruin the entire outfit taxes I don't like spending money on things that are not efficient so actually,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,yeah tax is like when I'm you know pulling millions of dollars into something that doesn't actually really get used effectively and that's why I love giving you Charities I don't like giving to Charities that like 90 of my money just goes back into marketing for that charity I like to give it to specific like sources that I know they're getting 100 of the protein I hate spending money on food just because I buy so much of it okay water I hate the idea of paying for water yeah what do you love spending money on food and experiences I think when I was younger I just didn't I was like food's food like why do you care especially when you travel a lot more I've grown to appreciate trying different things in like different Cuisines definitely experiences experiences especially while you're young they're honestly the best use of your money and yeah I,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,honestly I'm so grateful that I did it personally love spending money on my friends so like my biggest expense almost every month I track it is is treating people to like lunch or dinner or coffee and stuff like that or buying gifts for people and next biggest is eating out okay I love spending money on travel and some people say it's stupid but I spend probably too much money on travel but it's fun it's an experience and I think experiences are always something that's worthwhile and spend money on tell me a financial Flex that you're proud of I took my dad to Hawaii when he retired as a gift and I'm buying myself extra car soon so I like take care of my family I have no car payment I have no mortgage I don't pay rent because I live at home so basically my overhead is very low it's basically just health insurance which is about 500 bucks a month which is already expensive but I don't have anything else besides the small bills you know small Bill don't don't have anything big so my recurring expenses every month less than a thousand dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,wow yes that's amazing I love that wow I'm able to do a lot of trips where when I meet the people there they're shocked by how little I paid so like I'll go to the Maldives and people are like oh yeah this is our honeymoon uh we spent thirty thousand dollars and say oh yeah this is our honeymoon too we spent like fifty thousand dollars and I'm like oh this is a trip I take like every other year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,and I spent like five thousand dollars wow having the ability to buy basically anything I want to in cash but leveraging credit it's a better maximize my cash what's your favorite personal finance book money Mammoth by Dr Brad klontz I learned that most of what we know about money is basically baked into our DNA from years upon years of financial either uh growth or trauma from our family that we don't even really realize until we sit down and actually talk to our family about it the four hour work week by Tim Ferriss it was such a game changer for me I read that when I was like 12 years old and it just totally changed the way that I viewed the world because it made me realize that you can live life without having to be stressed with the job and with work and there's ways to sort of hack it it's either Rich Dad Poor Dad or Ray dalio's principles I know Ray Dahlia's principles is not exactly a personal finance book but I learned a lot from it yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,what's the most frugal thing you've ever done I would say on a daily basis I use the McDonald's app to get the McDonald's iced coffee for a dollar and eight cents with tax rather than just going to Phils or paying for like a five dollar coffee at Starbucks it's a dollar so I feel like I could find a Dollar on the ground round you know what I mean it almost feels free like it feels like a great purchase I'm like okay great that's so I use the McDonald's app too all the time McDonald's app one of the things that I used to do was I used to like kind of like go around on the street and if I saw something that somebody had just like put in front of their home for free like a mattress or an exercise bike I would like pick it up and then like resell it on like um on a platform like I guess like you have Craigslist here in Australia it's called Gumtree,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,I'm so happy that I did that because I think it makes you a lot more resourceful and you you look for opportunities maybe where other people don't see them I had a black backpack and black jeans and they were faded instead of buying new ones I bought black dye and I just re-dyed my bag and my pants wow I probably spent like an hour or two hours trying to figure out how to like make the dye how to make it perfect um,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,yeah that's most people think of wow what's your biggest piece of advice for someone that wants have become wealthy at a younger age try everything and appreciate failure I started a lot of businesses before anything took off and all these businesses failed I started a bunch of other like Instagram pages and YouTube channels before like ASMR or mukbang or Tech channels and none of them I actually took off but from each one I learned something that I implemented in my next project eventually I accumulated enough skills to really go 100 on this Finance Channel find what you're passionate about and then how to leverage it oftentimes it's not going to be working for someone else it is going to be either starting your own company content creation starting on small business if you're not into the business side of that if you're more into the artistic side of it can you like find these like super like millionaire clients who would pay for like the like expensive Hedges that are like shaped like swats and stuff,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,so like there's ways to make it work stop turning into what everyone else is doing so if it's like investing try to be a bit of a contrarian so everyone's pulling their money out of the stock market because they're scared that means that you probably shouldn't pull your money out of the stock market because if you do what everyone else does you're never going to beat the markets ever so try to always be contrarian and look where nobody else is looking seek knowledge and then go for scale and leverage especially early on in life you just want to like learn as much as you can and never stop learning always be curious as we talked about earlier develop skills that are going to make you more money there's only so much that you can cut out of a budget before you start having to earn more income so it kind of goes back to what I was saying earlier find out what you're passionate about and find a way to grow a skill that allows you to monetize that passion we all have lack a part of ourselves that that we love and we want to show the public but then we also have our shadow cells and that's the kind of parts of ourselves that maybe we've been taught that they're bad and we shouldn't have these parts of ourselves so if you want to be successful if you want to achieve well you kind of have to make peace with like both parts of yourself the things that you love about other people that's what you love about yourself the things that you don't like about other people that's what you don't like about yourself or you're too afraid to admit in yourself sometimes when you see something you don't like if you see something that triggers you that should be a prompt to start asking yourself why does it trigger you like what is it maybe there's a part of yourself that you've pushed away for so long being honest with yourself learning about it knowing that there's honestly nothing to be ashamed of because like like nobody's perfect we all have these good and bad parts of ourselves and yeah learn to live with it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YYHzkVVSpAo,and then that's how you can like move forward and be successful build your wealth just just learn about yourself so there you have it asking personal finance creators how to become rich personally I learned so much talking to everyone today I feel like everyone had a loved really great insight and if you take what they say and actually apply it you can become rich too again I encourage you guys to download Clio let her roast your finances and yeah the link is going to be down below in the description and also if you guys want to sign up for my free newsletter it's called hustleville and we basically teach you how to become a better entrepreneur in three minutes or less per week if you guys enjoy the video please make sure to hit that like button and also subscribe for more content just like this I'm making ton of videos about personal finance investing and Entrepreneurship thank you so much for your time and I'll see you in the next video peace [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bku0ailQfl8, you know what pisses me off in crypto investment tubers look we all know who they are the people are all about nickel and diming and saving your way with credit cards and whatever to millions of dollars that's all good and fine i'm good with that that is fantastic advice for everybody else but crypto is is not about safe investing it is about making a lot of money very quickly i know this sounds like get rich quick whatsoever things but it just simply is and people saying by bitcoin and ethereum are apples okay because these are like the two worst things you can buy in crypto people keep saying buy bitcoin on their channels have how to probably buy bitcoin as a beginner what you go to coinbase and you press a button and you buy bitcoin it's the worst thing you can buy right now the returns are literally the worst thing the worst on the market why would you buy bitcoin in the bull run it does terrible returns compared to literally everything else i'll show you in a second,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,and then they're like oh by ethereum too it's like the silver have you used ethereum it is literally broken to buy a coffee with ethereum costs like 150 dollars to buy an nft you know those things that like logan paul is selling or mint one of them is like 200 at peak time it's a thousand dollars to do it it is literally 100 times more expensive than your credit card right now and there are no fixes in sight and so it just drives me crazy when super safe investment tubers are like yeah let's just buy some bitcoin in the ethereum bitcoin delivers the worst returns ethereum is literally broken and there's no guarantee that ethereum is going to be around 10 years from now because everything about it is literally dot it's dog,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,so what i want to do in this video is tell you the biggest mistake i made and it's the general logic of this marketplace to the bitcoin and ethereum's a safe bet no bitcoin could easily be flipped it is so broken it is such a busted piece of crap tech that the second any coin has a larger market cap than bitcoin there's no point to bitcoin and ethereum is like it's it's like a 56k modem and being like a 56k modem is the future no it's not it's probably gonna get it's probably gonna grow but these are the two worst things to buy in this bro run because they're gonna get the worst returns let me explain okay so we're looking at the prices right now and we just need to do some basic thinking okay so let me show you where i got in i got into bitcoin um right about here okay so from about i didn't get in at three but i i i sold my house about a year ago,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,and i had tons of money saved up because i was really waiting fist for the next crypto bull run and when i saw five thousand dollars i got in in about this time frame this is when i really started dumping money in so let's just say my average buy price was like six thousand dollars so at this time i've rounded up i'm not gonna do math in front of you about 8x my money from this point right here that's pretty damn good no it's not that's terrible for the crypto market let's just keep going down right here if we got in at ethereum okay uh one year this was at one hundred dollars now it keep that at two thousand dollars so i could have 20x my money right here bitcoin was literally the worst thing i could have bought and in this market right here you can see that bitcoin uh routinely let's let's look at the past month or past let's just look like from here from the start of this year 38 000 to 58 000. this is this is not even this is nearly a 2x less than a 2x,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bku0ailQfl8,okay now if we go look at ethereum this year okay the broken turd i'm not even i'll get into the tech and ethereum here in a second it blows my mind when people are like ethereum's just the second safe bet that's gonna be no it's not like literally check this out if i go if i go and try something let's just do a basic swap right now seriously no i'll just i'll just load up the test wall right here and we'll do a basic swap on ethereum okay uh let's just point to 0.3 eth and then we'll trade it for i don't know uni okay and of course i know i could use uni swap in this example i'm just going to show you it's going to cost me 50 bucks literally to swap the coin,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,okay if i'm doing a larger transaction this will be 150 to 300 if i'm buying an nft or i'm moving money around or i'm interacting with nftx which is basically um any complicated any complicated transaction ethereum it's 150 during low times if i'm doing it during peak times like when the market's moving it's gonna be 300 to 400 to put this in perspective if i was buying a piece of if i was buying a coffee at starbucks with ethereum right now the transactions going it would be like a hundred dollars in transaction fees and there's no solution to this in sight and people like yo this is what you should this is what you invest in what all right so anyways we can get in um there's there's hope for ethereum don't get me wrong,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bku0ailQfl8,but again if we just look at this at the beginning of the year it has gone up literally not even 2x what a stupid what a stupid thing to buy in crypto and why is it so stupid to buy well look at the market caps in order for ethereum just to double it has to go to almost 400 billion dollars in order for bitcoin to double and give you 2x roi it has to go to 200 billion dollars or actually 2 trillion dollars is that possible yeah i firmly believe it bitcoin is going to be 1.5 million dollars someday i firmly believe that but you need to understand that bitcoin is a way to store value and it's pretty much the the safe savings account of of crypto with with those huge asterisks because it is crypto ethereum i think is so over hyped and it's not delivering any returns and i think it could go to like ten thousand this bull run but the problem with ethereum is there's this huge market cap that's being sucked away by cardano binance coin and polka dot and other great projects all the same time,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,so it has this giant market cap that is also being shared with four other projects that are significantly better than it now even if ethereum does perform over 10 years i don't have a lot of faith in it because they've not fixed anything and all their solutions they're just they just keep promising them and they keep saying like yeah but we're going to fix it ethereum 2.0 that fixes that gas problem doesn't come out for like another year,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,maybe when this this bull run will be over by the time ethereum 2.0 comes out now let's look at cardano which is overall a much better project than ethereum at the moment but if we go and look at one year if we got this in march uh it was at two cents this was a 50x this is like a coin that everyone's known about this is not a secret coin this has been a very popular coin one of the top coins for a long time hell if you got this in january you would have already six decks your money instead of the 2x and ethereum and this is just a top coin this isn't even like a hidden altcoin this is just a well-known coin polka dot everybody's known about polkadot for an entire year you go and look at polkadot right here all the way from the beginning of the year is that 2.90 it's capped out recently at 42 hell if you got it in january you would have at least two and almost you would have leased two extra money right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,okay if you got it in right here about ten dollars you're looking at a nice juicy 3x these are just common well-known big project coins you get on uni swap literally the decks that everyone uses this is very well known you get it in march it was at four dollars now it's at 27 you got this the beginning of the year you have a nice juicy 32. now here's here's where it really starts to get nasty you could pick literally any coin except bitcoin and ethereum and you'd have better returns literally any coin the market right now that bitcoin in the theory i'm gonna save bets well no again bitcoin is garbage technology ethereum is garbage technology there's no safe bet to either of them i think bitcoin will still be around,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,i think ethereum will get its stuff together but these are not like these are not in the slam dunks in the whole especially ethereum so the first point i want to make buying these two is literally the dumbest thing you can do in a bull market because if bitcoin keeps going up which we're all counting on everything else is going to perform significantly better you have to understand that that was my big mistake if i bought literally anything besides the thurman bitcoin i would be sitting on tens of millions of dollars right now so first off don't be don't be a all right if you're getting the crypto spin the wheel a little bit but here's where it starts to get really frustrating because i just mentioned the top 10 obvious coins you could have easily came in here for example i got in the voyager at about 30 cents 30 to 50 cents all right this this was at like 19 cents for the longest time in january it was about like 50 cents this is when i first heard about it okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,it's at five bucks right now it's like it's capped out at seven this is literally almost a 14 x on where i got in at and this was just an obvious coin that everyone's been talking about engine coin really good project you got in literally you got in march last year's at eight cents okay you got in january you got a nice clean 3x right here so what point am i trying to make right here it's that a chimpanzee could make money in this market right now this is why when like guru's like called it i'm like dude you're literally throwing a basketball in a swimming pool and acting like you just shot a three-pointer from across the court if you look at any coin we'll just go to like the top 30 coins right here every single one has just exploded and given way better returns than ethereum and bitcoin and so when i see people on youtube just singing i'll only invest in bitcoin and ethereum when ethereum is literally broken trash,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,and then even if we're not considering the technology behind bitcoin and ethereum every single coin underneath it performs better when bitcoin is up if bitcoin goes to 100 000 it will 2x and every single other one of these coins will 4 and 5x so what is the point i'm trying to make in this video don't be a okay dig in a little bit at least the top 10 coins like literally chain link right here what has it done this year oh given way better returns than ethereum and bitcoin and i'm just generally mad because i got i took this advice at first,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,and i lost so much money just playing around in these these two kiddie pools right here the thing you need to understand about the crypto market is if bitcoin goes up everything goes up and a lot bigger returns than bitcoin if bitcoin goes down everything's gonna go down in a lot bigger amounts than bitcoin now technically then in the market if bitcoin goes down all of these will go up again making it just like why would you buy bitcoin in ethereum there is literally almost zero chance in my mind that ethereum outperforms polka dot or cordano and his amount as returns it could,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,but it's not going to be like maybe cardano will 8x and ethereum will 10x in like the worst case so my advice to you is that you're not safe in any coin you if you put all your money in ethereum you're still not safe every single time bitcoin drops ethereum has the biggest paper hands out of every single coin on the market like it has the most people that don't know what they're doing in it look at this dip right here from 2000 to literally nearly hundred dollars this is paper hands that don't know what they're buying they've never loaded up made a mask or bought an nft one time like look at that this is people that don't know what they're buying and so understand this you're gonna eat dog crap whether you buy any of these so if you're going to put dog crap on your plate at least put dog crap on your plate that's going to give you a 5 10 x return more than likely the chances of ethereum getting the 10k the chances of cardano getting the five dollars pretty good okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,i could see cardano going to 150 billion i could see ethereum going to 500 billion but if it goes to 500 billion it's only gonna go to like three thousand something dollars if cardano goes to just ha the market cap to the ethereum's at right now it's gonna be at five dollars litecoin has a tiny market cap compared to ethereum there's it could very easily go to a hundred billion this bull run with everything's going on paypal and everything like that so don't follow these little these little goofy slow investment tubers they are perfect at what they do i have massive respect for what they do but their investment advice and crypto is so terrible and it lost me money and if you want to get in here and actually make some money this bull run you need to play in at least the top 10 outgoings because just to recap if bitcoin goes down ethereum is going to go down and cardano's going to go down and polka dot's going to go down they're all going to go down and they're all going to eat the same amount of crap each time for example if we go look at polka dot right here over one month where his peak was i think this is around when with the crash happening right about 40 dollars dropped 25,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,okay actually dropped less than ethereum because you don't have paper hands and dot and cardano like you do in ethereum okay like everybody doesn't know what they're doing and thinks they want to make money is in ethereum okay this this dropped literally nearly 40 percent and if we go look at coins where people actually understand what they're buying like cardano of course there was some news propping this up cardano didn't even drop it dropped it dropped down to 90. okay and then it bounced right back up okay same thing with dot so literally i think ethereum is the riskiest coin you can buy because it has the most paper hands and people that don't know what they're doing in it it's gonna it takes the biggest dips out of all these when bitcoin crashes so an advice don't don't be like it's too late in the market where you can just safely put your money in bitcoin ethereum and expect a nice juicy 56x return it's too late,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
bku0ailQfl8,you're late you should have been in last year if you're getting in right now the way you're going to make money it's going to be in the alt coins you shouldn't buy bitcoin you shouldn't buy ethereum and when the bull run is over and everything's going down take all your profits from your all coins then put it in bitcoin and ethereum but you're not going to be making juicy 10x rois on bitcoin and ethereum and if they do make you a 10x roi i guarantee any of the coins below them will make you 20 to 30x if you're in crypto you're playing russian roulette this is not safe one three percent long-term investing this is this is you are at a casino right now everyone is throwing ungodly amounts of money on overvalued projects and you are trying to get in to these pumps and you're trying to dump before everybody else dumps that is what you're doing and if you think that you're doing something else you're crazy you're crazy if you like rants like this and you want to see the coins and stuff that i'm buying the nfts i'm collecting or just more angry rants like this follow me at css becker,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

m2TOm6b-J_o, guys i'm going to do something no crypto youtube has ever done before i'm going to tell you you're going to get 1000x gains from this video there is absolutely never been a video ever that said something like this but this is going to be the first one ever and it's also going to be the only one that's ever delivered it if you've been browsing around crypto youtube asking yourself hmm which video can i trust you need a look at this video right here because if you don't know any better if you did not know if you've been hiding under a rock most people know me as the most woke empty house business crypto fat advice guy with a great body was also family friendly extremely pg,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,and i become world famous by being the world's number one fastest orange eating champion in the florida tri-state area part of being this important of a person is being extremely rich and i become extremely rich by picking micro cap coins that make me a lot of money and in this video jokes aside not really i'm in the yuck yuck mood today i'm going to show you how to find the best coins in crypto and analyze them for yourself before people spot them and without having to rely on influencers to point their dick in whatever direction they want you to so they can dump on you that also being said if you ever need help knowing where to point your dick you could follow me on twitter because my calls they rock if you got into altura for example you're at like an 8x right now or d-race or future poker or donkey the list is endless you should follow me there my calls are all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,so let's get into this thing you got to understand is most people really struggle to make money and this applies to crypto for the same reason it applies in other areas of life they don't know how to focus in a certain way that allows them to master something and if you don't master something you can't make money period you have to be good at what you do and you have to be knowledgeable and master what you do to make money this is extremely important you might not know this but i have done quite well in business and the number one thing that stopped me from being successful and the thing that made me very successful with a company that's done incredibly well is focus and understanding how to only focus on one thing at one time and when you focus on one thing at one time you get good at it you understand it deeply thus you master it thus when you master it you can perform better than other people and catch things that other people aren't going to catch which in crypto is catching things early,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,so so the reason why most people struggle at crypto is they apply the same shitty metaphor that they have in their normal life to crypto which is try to do everything and be good at everything all at once see the problem with this is when you invest like this you're one not going to catch anything early because you don't understand anything super well a lot of people think when you're trying to catch crypto gyms what you want to do is you look at the entire market that's like sitting in a room with 500 different doors and each door releases a specific type of animal this one releases tigers this one releases penguins this one releases horses and trying to judge which one of these is a purebred in its respective niche now this is going to be impossible to do because let's just say we have a bunch of other animals right here let's say we got lions bears and let's say we got ada investors because that's a whole different other breed of animal right there when you are trying to master this many type of animals at once you're not going to know anything about each animal because there's just too much information so most cryptos are sitting right here and they have all this information flying at them,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,and they don't they don't know anything about it so they can't catch opportunities early and so what you end up trying to do is trying to go and make money by predicting which one of the top 100 coins is going to pump now in a bull run this is not that hard to do if you watch human behavior and what people are doing that being said you're not going to make life-changing gains either even if if you caught dot after its initial run up from the bear market which was about right here you're only sitting at like a 6x gain tops,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,okay not even that and everybody made all the money this born they bought back here and everybody that made ungodly amounts of money this bull run they did what i'm about to show you see the smartest people in crypto don't sit around and try and watch every door all at once and just watch one door for example people that just watched nfts for years in crypto they just sat there and watched nfts they made tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars this bull run people that sat around and just watched ada for years just watch the ada door they made tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars this bull run this applies to any other thing ever the thing you need to understand is there's about a billion different niches in crypto there's insurance there's yield farming there's going to be real estate there's going to be there's smart contracts there are smart contract systems exclusively on ada ethereum polygon the list is literally endless the way you make money in this space is by mastering just one of those niches for example if you just mastered dot,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,okay just a dot ecosystem not something big and sexy like nfts just the dot ecosystem and you just sat here watching the dot door and all you did was understand that door you didn't understand anything else you would have caught kusama you would have caught fala you would have caught moon river for example i have acquaintance on twitter his name is donnie big bags all he does is watch dot he's like a dot freak he knows everything about it he called everything super duper early and made a ton of money how can you do this well it's because when you are a horse expert and all you do is look at horses all day you just sit around looking at horses you read magazines about horses you talk to breeders of horses you spend all your time at the horse track you're going to be able to pick a good horse when it comes to the door you're not going to be able to pick a good penguin you're not going to pick a good tiger you're not going to be able to pick a good bear,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,and you just when you see an ada person come to that door you run for the hills all right you cover yourself in your own poo and hope that he doesn't come close to you i'd sooner spend a week locked in a room with pee wee herman then he's even spending a minute with those people that being said if all you do is watch horses you're going to be able to pick the good horse the end and you'll need to pick a few good horses to make a lot of money in crypto and so what you need to stop doing is trying to look at everything all at once what has worked exceptionally well for me for example is i only really invest in gaming crypto i know what's going on generally throughout the rest of the market i can tell you a bit about d5,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,but i cannot tell you anything deep about what's happening in the ecosystems of any of these coins i can't tell you anything deep that's happening with them i can't look at a new protocol that pops up in these coins i can't look at the team i can't look at the people behind it i can't look at the community i can't tell you whether it's a good horse or not confidently why because i just don't know but for example in gaming crypto because i only invest in that and i've researched an extensive amount of video game marketing i've made my own games i go out every single day and i just look at gaming crypto twitter anytime i'm talking or networking or going in discords i'm talking to gaming cryptos or people investing in gaming cryptos every single day i'm talking new projects that haven't even launched a coin yet are just working on their development of their game they haven't launched any nfts yet when i'm going through and i'm looking at what's about launch what's coming out,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,i know every single launch pad owner i know all the big names in space i know the top founders so for example how did i get an elluvium super early i was going and digging through crypto gaming nobody wanted to touch alluvium,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,no one was even looking at it the reason why i invested in eluvium is because i predicted that 3d games that were based around pokemon like dynamics where you could trade nft pokemon were going to be huge that's why i invested in the project how would i find out about that what i'm telling you right now and so when i'm going and looking at gaming cryptos every single day i can tell you if a game's going to probably be good or bad or has a chance to do a large large return or at least give myself the best advantage possible because all i do is look at horses all i do is look at gaming cryptos all i do is talk to founders and i see the patterns between behind a good team good development good art good promotion marketing all the way down the line and i'm able to talk to all the communities talk to all the discords and get a good general vibe about things way way way way before they happen just like for example that guy i mentioned with doc he was able to see all these projects way before they happen because all he did was hang out and look at dot because that it was very easy for him to recognize an opportunity and so the way you actually go and make a ton of money in crypto in my opinion is you do just that if you look at all the people the best example is nfts the people that watch nfts all they had to do it was actually not even that hard all you had to do was just even be looking at nfts in 2020 and know what you're looking at so these people when they were looking at nfts all in 2020 when nobody was looking at it they just invested in crypto punks the stupid rock things one to one artists that were the top artists on the spaces and how did they find all these things well they just looked at it for a long time and then when nfts took off how do they keep making good investments for example if you look at prank c on twitter he's made ungodly amounts of money caught literally every single trend how do they get areas of prominence and also catch all these investments super early well they've just been looking at it forever are these people did these people probably make money in other types of cryptos,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,yes but nowhere near the amount of money they made in fts why because they just sat there for a literal year when no one was talking about something and watched the nft door so what should you do in crypto right now there's going to be a thousand emerging markets insurance lending yield farming this is endless crypt gaming crypto the the cardano ecosystem the avax ecosystem if you just watched the avex ecosystem or you were an avex expert you would have made millions of dollars just the last two months but you didn't because you aren't an expert in anything and so what you should do look at the emerging markets that you are interested in find something you're interested in i love video games i love video game art,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,so i'm just entrenched in that market because i know in the next five years it's going to take over the entire world crypto is going to change real estate it's going to change insurance it's going to change legal if you're a lawyer right now for example look at everything that applies to legal stuff in crypto and then say where the proms at and get to know the teams get to know the people behind them get to know the lawyers and the legal departments and everything that's going through all these things and say okay these people had a lot of experience doing this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,and they have a good crypto team over here combine that knowledge together to become an expert in one area and then just invest in that area are you going to miss that 2x cardano pump probably are you gonna miss that next golden nft project you probably are but the only way to consistently make money in crypto is to be able to catch things early and the only way to consistently catch things early is be able to recognize things early you're not going to be able to guess and by the time some influence or someone on twitter is hinting at it it's too damn late,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,i hate this type of investing right here the way i invest right now is i find low caps in projects i think are going to be huge six months one year from now regardless of the market conditions gaming crypto is going to take over the world regardless of what bitcoin is doing bitcoin is irrelevant to it in the long term short term bitcoin is very relevant to it however if you're playing in these top 100 coins even the top 200 you're probably not going to make a good 500x and the only way to make money at this point in these things is to hold a lot of money in it sure cardano could go to eight to ten dollars but the only way you're gonna make life-changing money from that is if you're holding a life-changing amount of money inside of cardano like 50 of your life savings that's risky,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,okay if you go and actually understand a space you can invest small amounts and make those huge returns for example if you got into certain gaming projects like axi early on you're at a 200 300 400 x or for example i have a good friend and the only thing he does is look at xrp and because of that he caught every single drop every single thing early he's made a phenomenal amount of money in xrp he caught all the drops of the flare network and everything else that's coming that way and he knows about everything so far in advance why because the dude just literally watches xrp he doesn't do anything else or look at anything else and he just looks at xrp all damn day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,and he knows things about i can't even fathom because that he's caught literally everything early and he's made so much money doing it and if you were looking at all the projects in gaming crypto back then it was really kind of obvious that axi was going to do that if you're looking at all the projects in nfts back then it was pretty obvious crypto punks and nfts in those spaces were going to do well because they were only the only thing that was there and on top of that there was enough time to gain knowledge that when the market started taking off you could predict what was going to pump everybody that was here from crypto punks at fifteen thousand dollars includes gary vee mark cuban myself people that got in early based on influences got in early we didn't even know what we were looking at until recently the nurse people they were in crypto punks when they're at 100 knew exactly what they're looking at right away that's how you do it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2TOm6b-J_o,so that's the video for today guys i just want to make something was useful that i think is by far the best way to invest in crypto if you want to make life changing money i don't know any other way to do it because every single person i know has made tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars this is what they did they were investing heavily in the bear market and they were looking at one or two spaces they deeply got and this is how they did it and this is how i've done very well the past few months and this year and every huge massive investment return i've gone it was using this strategy and not my wingding let's like throw things and guess what's going to pump next strategy that's again why if you look at my portfolio it is 90 gaming crypto that's how i find my gems that's how i think you should find your gems and if you don't master a specific space you won't be able to recognize gyms it's just that damn simple there's too much going on in crypto to be able to pick gyms across multiple niches consistently it doesn't happen it doesn't work and that's all there is to it so if you want to see what i'm looking at a little bit early and maybe get hints from me follow me at cssbecker on twitter i leave little riddles to what i'm investing in i never outright say what i'm investing in because we'll pump it but if you're smart you'll find those things early and make some really good rois that's it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

rUFAEslz84k,and right it's very impressive i've never seen a coin that is able to successfully fluff as hard as cardano did it is literally like a ken doll trying at a playboy mansion orgy it's just it's just not gonna happen that being said let's let's get back on topic here all right so bitcoin's taking a little bit of a slump right now nobody's gonna agree with me on this that's fine it's a silly thing to do because everybody knows i call bitcoin 100 right every single time if you take away all the time's been wrong all the times i was just joking all the times i was just playing just tickling your goose i shoot 100 here so you should really base your entire financial future around this okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,take your kids college education bank account put it on what i'm about to say here i think we're going a lot lower why because we just haven't been punished in a bit if you look at the last three months there hasn't been a severe punishment in a while okay this kind of looks like a severe punishment but if we look at a severe punishment in bitcoin it's more like this okay it's more like these things right here we need to see something a little bit more harsh i think we're seeing kind of similar to this dip right here we're going to bounce back up and then we're going to get a proper spanking before we see a huge uptrend in my opinion now of course if bitcoin doesn't like to play here we're going to lose all of our money but again crypto's not about being financially responsible and it's not about looking at both ends of the spectrum let's just talk about only the opportunity to make big bucks here what do we want to do here so first and foremost you might be looking at shiba and new,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,look i'm going to make fun of shiba news holders all all day long because the coin is exclusively made up with whiny skatey boys who live in the grandmother's basement they're about as beta as beta can get that being said they are making a lot of money right now they're gonna be able to go and buy their girlfriend's boyfriend's a new car so don't don't hate on them too much they're having a great day that being said when a dog coin like this is pumping it's usually it's usually a really really bad sign for the market and so this is one huge massive red flag for me that we're about to have a massive dip it just shows total disrespect to the market and just a really loosey-goosey thing going on in retail i think it's going to trigger a big dip right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,but i just don't like the sign whatsoever it could actually trigger another top in my opinion last time we saw dogecoin and all this nonsense happening that was a top if that doesn't happen right now we're in such a juicy point for all these coins like always i'm going to list a few more conservative picks and then i'm going to be listing a few more don't bring that home to thanksgiving picks if we keep going right here i'm seeing solana flipping cardano and i'm seeing it flipping by nance coin to be possibly the the second biggest smart contract platform underneath ethereum i think it's just going to keep going,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,and i think we're going to see xrp bounce up big time right here as well xrp is pretty risky though because the sec lawsuit which they're probably about to win so if i was a conservative investor right now i would just go solana dot and if i was a little bit ballsy i would go xrp dot's about to make a massive run salon is about to make a massive run xrp is probably going to win their lawsuit and make a massive run these right here are the best places you want to put your money if you're very very very conservative in my opinion cardano i know i joke about cardona but let's just have a straight face right now there isn't really anything new or hypey coming to cardano for a long time it's probably going to go maybe the 10th spot or maybe drop out of the top 10. i'm sorry cardano holders i know you want to read and scream because your wife's not talking to you right now and you're really sensitive,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,but that's just probably what's going to happen now if i'm looking at coins below this what's probably about the dip right here is again we're seeing about avex about the dip and we're seeing polygon dipping back a little bit as well but if we look at polygon especially right here it really looks like it wants to run okay it's made this uptrend right here it's about to probably dip again and we're probably gonna see this huge boom right here the reason why we're gonna see that it's again we're probably about to see a massive gaming crypto bull run here in the next few months and that's the that's the coins you want to be in,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,but if you're not into the risk and you're not really watching your investments super heavily polygon is what a lot of the games are built on i don't think it's great for games right now it's way too slow but nobody else knows that and nobody else invests on things based on what it actually does in crypto so polygon right here in my opinion is going to ride that narrative super well with solana that's another reason why i would be investing in solana right now if i was more conservative avax just has it's just a very good layer one smart contract system and it's just the market caps incredibly low right now for where it is avax could easily be in the top ten absolutely no problem and with cardano just hemorrhaging money right now binance coin just being and a lot of this money from ship is going to be rolling out to somewhere else i think avax is just such an easy choice right here and on top of that the things underneath abax so i'm not gonna mention the coin i mentioned last time a little bit too small,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,but if you're looking at something like joe underneath abex again great buy,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,but again i need to stress what we're probably about to see before we get into the more deeper darker coins we're probably gonna see bitcoin in my opinion go down to 52k and look i know when i say this kind of stuff people get really mad at me they say they hate me they say they don't want to watch the channel anymore and my response to that is that's completely fine because if i was popular with people that draw exclusively in purple crown and eat their own boogers and get triggered by basic statements like hey bitcoin could probably go down here because it usually goes down 30 percent that's fine i don't want to be popular with people this exclusive tv watching as dora the explorer this is not a children's channel this is not for sensitive beta males who haven't talked to a female in their entire life this is for people that are here to actually make money so if that's you that's completely fine there's plenty of other channels that will tell you it's going up only and you're gonna have a one million dollar bitcoin that's finally gonna reverse the absolute losing streak that is your life so if that's you there's plenty of other youtube channels for you to watch this is not for you this is for men that have gone on a date in the last five years and have the emotional stability of i don't know at least a 12 year old so continuing on we really haven't been punished for a bit and we're probably gonna see it dip down like 52k we might not but eventually we're gonna see a big nasty dip coming here,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,okay it's just gone up way too fast and that's just the trend we're gonna see a lot of fear happen when this dip probably happens and if you look at bitcoin usually what happens when it takes a dip is it dips goes back up a little bit and then it takes the real dip okay so that's probably what we're gonna see right here so the real play is to wait a couple of days and then start scooping up these coins watch for a capitulation candle we haven't seen a capitulation candle on bitcoin in a very long time okay we haven't seen a big nasty candle like that and that's when you can get the juiciest and that's when you can get the juiciest buys of bull runs it just simply is so we're gonna see maybe a capitulation candle down to 52 53k maybe even 55k,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,but we want to look for that sharp candle and that's when we want to be buying up these things so you should be watching these coins i just mentioned like a hawk now what i'm looking at now is you guys know i almost exclusively deal in gaming kryptos okay and so we're going to see this massive bull run in gaming cryptos for example one just last video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rUFAEslz84k,i mentioned veracity when absolutely nuclear after we mentioned it mentioned elluvium massive run-up mention engine last video huge run up as well mentioned altura literally went insane a couple days after that video as people started buying into it even more we called it all the way back down here d-race went parabolic you really should have got on in these coins last video that being said what we're probably going to see here in the next few months is we're going to see this gaming bull run i'm in all the vc groups i'm talking all the big brands and whatnot everybody's just putting stupid amounts of money into games right now you want to be here when this happens but again we're up on this last bump right here and maybe it's not the best time to buy i don't really know but i would expect in about five to seven days maybe a little bit more we might see this big dip if we don't i'm sorry you missed the big grand buying opportunity i'm sorry but i wouldn't be buying it right now i'd be looking for this big dip,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rUFAEslz84k,and so what am i going to be looking at one i would just buy and if you're a conservative investor okay which i'm not i'm a degenerate piece of okay but if you're conservative investor i would just buy engine if we see a dip coming up here all right i was also i would also buy sandbox sandbox has a much bigger chance or much better chance of being bigger than axe infinity and it's like one-tenth the market cap it simply does the end veracity is going to be so important to streaming and games again the market caps extremely low right here as soon as gaming takes off it's going to have a 2 3 billion dollar market cap it's going to be super over evaluated and then what i want to look at is games that are on an upward trend they're probably going to go backwards a bit okay so altura right here just went insane wait for it it's probably going to drop to like nine eight cents i would buy a ton of altura then okay you should have been taking profits right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,okay the thing about altcoins and the coins i'm talking about right here the reason why you should focus on those conservative coins i talked about because if you're not a person who's comfortable hitting the sell button and flipping and trading things you're gonna get caught up in these okay you need to watch these market caps but it's probably gonna go back down they're right here okay it's gonna get slow again wait for that grab it up d-race same exact thing all the horses were coming out just like i mentioned last video as the horses came out powell blew up now it's on a downtrend again we're probably not going to see this next massive uptrend until horses start racing and whatnot and horses start really trading very highly on open c which is going to happen here soon this will probably drop down to maybe 250 or something like that scoop it up okay this is this is an easy 300 500 million dollar market cap as soon as it takes off and becomes a strong competitor to zed run the finia we called this last video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rUFAEslz84k,okay all right we literally called it right here absolutely exploded okay the video was right here okay so no we didn't pump this one it went nuts on its own accord the thing you need to also look at with these games right here is they usually don't do too much after the initial launch and so if you can see stuff like this happening especially with upcoming idos definio went under the radar right i mentioned in one video everybody kind of ignored it game has then they actually started replacing their gameplay releasing all the things they're actually going on people went nuts they start investing in it like crazy another one i'd be looking at right now would be made awards but it's a little high right now what i'd be looking for is mater wars to dip down to maybe 10 cents or something like that and mata wars is phenomenal i think it's to do incredibly well that being said it's right after ido what you're going to see with most games is they go up very similar to alluvium right here okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,so let's look at the all-time range on alluvium you can't see it right here but aluminum went let's go and remove it right there all right eluvian went up and then just did nothing okay and then went up if you go look at any games this is the pattern they usually follow and so ignore the initial ideo hype and then grab gains after they go down you're going to see that a lot d-race did the same exact thing okay d-race for example went absolutely nuts after ido you can't see it because everything else looks very small compared to it if we go look at it what all right took a massive dive and then started going up and then went up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rUFAEslz84k,okay that's what you need to be looking for in games because usually when games ido they lose a lot of their momentum because there's nothing going on they're just developing a game but the really cool thing about gaming and i like to mention a few things that are coming up as well is there's so many new things that are coming and people really don't understand gaming they just don't understand all the cool games they're coming out and whatnot so for example like big times doing their land sale phantom galaxy has so much cool stuff coming out and so many nfts and whatnot dropping that nobody's really looking at and there's so many titles like for example wonder hero which i think is going to pull another to finial here real soon they're literally just under the radar that you can catch really early there's also a really cool project like banger games that's coming out which is going to be like the currency that's going to underline underneath tons of crypto games because it just makes no sense for them to all have their own currency you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
rUFAEslz84k,and so you really need to be watching this space like a hawk maybe join neo tokyo you know the best gaming alpha discord slash nft group ever no literally we had the highest return on free mint ever and we create the most valuable nft utility currency to ever exist in crypto so yeah it is actually pretty cool all right sorry just tooting my horn i had to mention at least for 10 seconds in this video so that my dudes is what i think is going on in the market right now i took profits last week on things that were way up and i'm not buying back in quite yet i'm still holding on to my major coins like moon river ftm a lot of my major gaming cryptos that being said i'm waiting for a little bit bigger of a dip i might be looking at 55k i think that might be the conservative dip,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
rUFAEslz84k,but i wouldn't be shocked if we saw 52k or something like that coming up and then again we could go much lower this could be a double top the dog coins are not a good sign they just simply are not they usually spell death for the crypto market from my experience that being said if we don't we're gonna see this huge parabolic rise going into february next year so i don't have anything else to say so i'm not gonna say anything else follow me at css becker the tip's on there oh incredible [Music] [Music] foreign,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5w6GLvaAdCQ, so I want to share with you something really morbid that really motivates me especially recently it's made it so much easier for me to get back into my nightmare mode but like the routines study for two to three hours a day basically don't do any negative things at all so look at all these blocks right here you're gonna see some in red you're gonna see some in gray each of those blocks represents a month in my life and those blocks right there if I live to about 80 years old and so you can see I've spent a lot of red blocks so that that's exactly pretty much how much of my time I've spent - how much time I have left and what motivates me more than anything and this is super morbid and you probably don't want to think about it is my imminent death and this sounds really morbid and it kind of is but it can also be cheerful at the same time but one thing that I did a lot in my 20s and even my early 30s as you feel like you have an abundance of time so much time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5w6GLvaAdCQ,and this can take me about five minutes to wrap up like always so by all means if you want to go click a Taylor Swift video you're making the exact same mistake I'm gonna make I'm going to cover in this video and that is the fact that you don't have time to really mess around see when you're 20 years old or even early 30s it feels like you have an infinite amount of time and that you can always keep putting off becoming that person that you want to become when you look at things like that chart are you actually going really think about the time you have left on earth suddenly you're gonna start being reminded you don't have a lot of time life is very very short and if you want to achieve that goal and become that person you want to become you're gonna realize it's gonna usually take you about five to ten years a lot of effort five to ten years of just changing and becoming exactly that person and sticking to it and the longer you wait to do that the longer you really wait to get your life handled the more of those blocks go away and once you actually start to think about if you wake up every single morning and look at the amount of blocks you have left if you wake up every single morning and think about really how it's gonna feel to be 70 80 years old and think about well how far are you on your life right now and usually if you're watching this video you're probably too age of 20 to 35 and if you think about all the time that you spent so far you can see that you've actually spent a whole other the time wasting it you've basically woken up and said I'm just not gonna work this day or I'm gonna get drunk and be hungover and waste these days and if you really think back about how much time you waste and then think about your death not just thinking,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5w6GLvaAdCQ,okay I wasted a lot of time but then think man and about four more of those time blocks if you're 20 to 30 let's take that 10 years and about four more of those ten year periods I'm I'm gonna be old I'm gonna be really close to death I'm not good people to start a business and I'm not saying you can't start a business at 50 60 etc but you also have to understand that there's gonna be a 10-year buffer probably between you and becoming that person you want to be that really hardcore winning person and you have to stay in that path for a long time and you know if I wait til 35 I'm not gonna really get to enjoy being that person until them 45 and then when I'm 45 I really don't have that much blocks left I have maybe 30 35 years left and that's it but that's literally just it so then you need to think about you know how would I feel it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5w6GLvaAdCQ,and I'm kind of taking this from a Tim Ferriss video that I'll link below but you kind of have to look back and think about you know how how much would I pay to get this day back when I was 70 you know how much would I pay to get this time back how much would I pay to go back in time when I'm 70 years old pics yourself being 70 80 years old and then about how much would I pay to go back in time and be that winter person now how much would I pay to go back and not waste those days not waste that time because again it's very finite you don't have a long time and that moment where you're going to be on your deathbed that's that's coming pretty quickly think about how fast five years went by in your life think about how fast ten years went by in your life it's gonna go by that fast even faster getting to that point I can tell you from 25 to 32 it went by in a blink of an eye,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5w6GLvaAdCQ,and I really wish the times I'd wasted not working on the business I wanted to work on not being as disciplined as I needed to be I wish I could get those times back because then I could actually go and I be in a such better position right now and not have that time in my life to enjoy it look if you go and become the person want to be at 35 you're gonna reach really that person the points maybe when you're 45 but only really gives you 15 years until you're in the elderly range to really enjoy that success in your life you want to maximize that time where you've hit success,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5w6GLvaAdCQ,and you're enjoying the fruits of your labor as soon as possible so if you're 20 get discipline now so that you can enjoy those fruits when you're 30 if you're 30 right now like you need to get on the ball it isn't you don't have time to delay you don't have time to eventually get there you don't have time to slowly walk into it has to happen now it has to happen today you can't keep putting it off you don't have time you don't have time because if you think about it and you don't because you're a lot of people like to put death in some corner in their mind where they're not going to think about if you really think about how long you have till you die it's going fast and you think that aging isn't gonna happen to you thinking oh this isn't this is gonna happen to me it's gonna happen it's it's happening you're along for the ride and the corrala coaster is going one direction and there's no escape from it and nobody on earth can escape from it whether the hobo are Jeff Bezos,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5w6GLvaAdCQ,so that's how I won the same this video one thing is helped keep me motivated is looking at those squares every single morning and remembering I'm not getting this day back so you don't have time to lay in bed you don't have time to play video games you don't have time to go and get drunk and be hungover you don't have time to waste a day you don't have time not to do it right now and I just wanted to remind you of that because that's something that's super motivated me super duper motivates me every single morning reminds me that hey it's time to be the person that you need to be to hit those goals there's no delaying there's no doing it next month there's no doing it after my birthday it's time to do it right now if you'd like to deals like this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

STjYPcVmkoA,so I started zip Trader in 2018 with the goal of making Finance interesting exciting digestible and making research practical and actually fun to do firstly I didn't like long and drawn out monotone content where you'd have some guy going with a chalkboard and saying oh this is support this is resistance and drawing trend lines for like three hours on a single stock so I decided to make short Zippy 10 minute videos where we go over a bunch of different tickers why they were moving strategy ideas and upcoming catalysts secondly I wanted to produce quality content on stocks that actually move and have opportunity not just sit here every single day and virtue signal about how you should only be invested in the S&P500 and how you shouldn't take it out a single penny until you retire it's up in most Finance people advise while going and doing the exact opposite in their personal lives I thought the everyday person should be given an opportunity to learn about strategies and exciting runs on stocks that quite frankly nobody wants you to learn about if something can run I want to cover it I don't care what the risks are we'll talk about them,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,but I'm not going to go ahead and say oh this is high risk so we can never talk about it I wanted to sit here and I wanted to say hey this is my thought process this is why I think it can run and these are the risks if the risks make sense to you do it if they don't then don't do it but I'm not going to go ahead and shut the hell up because somebody's going to be upset that something's not the s p 5 hundo thirdly and building on that I wanted to create content that was realistic set people up with realistic expectations covered the good and the bad building on that risk conversation I don't like content that talks about high rewards but doesn't constantly harp on the risk with those rewards in the stock market and in life you have to know that your reward is very very proportional to the level of risk that you took to get that reward those who sit in the corner of their house under a blanket and do nothing all day well they have very very little risk yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,but they also have very very little potential for reward fourthly when I came onto the scene here on YouTube I found content that was either very very virtue signaling where they just talked about the S&P500 and how you can only invest into that you got a dollar cost average until retirement or content that was very very flashy that talked about all these different material items and wouldn't talk about strategy at all so people that wanted to be excited by Finance would gravitate towards the flashy lifestyle stuff and wouldn't get any actual value on how to trade how to invest how to learn about what is going on in the stock market how to learn about the macro Cycles how to learn about this and that I like nice things you like nice things but a bunch of fancy cores fancy vacations fancy houses all that kind of stuff it has nothing to do with the stock market once you get into the stock market because they like the game of challenging themselves and growing and of course yes that involves making money but you don't have to go and talk about everything you make every second in fact one time I got a bit away from this back in 2020 when I bought this place I posted a house tour video and after I posted it I felt really disgusted why because that wasn't the message that I wanted to send out into the world that wasn't me that content was not what I want to portray so I went ahead,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,and I took it down was that an overreaction maybe I don't want people watching and thinking about a lifestyle I want people watching and thinking about the passion for this Market the passion for entrepreneurship business analyzing companies whatever it is I want people thinking about that not about some dumb material possessions love houses love watches cars all that kind of stuff,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,but they have no relation to the stock market they are just icing on the cake if you can get them Fifth and most importantly I wanted to create content that every single person who watched would have something very concrete to take away I wanted everybody to come to this Channel and get some sort of value whether that's A New Perspective whether that's a trade idea whether that's an understanding on some sort of macro concept I wanted everybody to have that experience whether or not my opinions are right I wanted people to think about their own opinions and formulate their own thoughts and be motivated to go out and do their own research I want it to be a crucial tool on people's trading Journey on their stock market Journey on their life Journey now alongside all these goals I also started this business to make money I am a capitalist I got into the stock market to make money and I also got into this media business which is really what the YouTube channel is to make money as well aside from all the goals which are provide value,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,I also at the end of the day know that nobody starts a business to lose money they start a business because they want to make those holy dollars but at the same time the type of business they choose to start is how you judge what kind of value they want to provide to the world and what kind of impact they want to have for me building a financial media company is a lot more aligned with my values and goals and aspirations and world view than working as another hog in an investment Bank working on some random merger and acquisition but folks I will be the first to tell you that along this journey I have made lots of mistakes lots of them but it means the world to me to have had the opportunity to reach so many hundreds of thousands of people to create so much different content both free and in our ZIP Trader you program to create our morning briefings and all the research alongside that to talk with so many different people over the last three four five years it means the world to me to have had this opportunity,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,and I've met a lot of you in person it's actually pretty crazy when I was in Paris last year I went into a gelato place and the guy in the gelato place was like hey Charlie I know you ravishing and I thought okay this is crazy I'm in Paris halfway across the world and someone knows me here what the hell and I have to be thankful to every single one of our ZIP Trader subscribers viewers zip Trader you members all of the different sponsors that we've worked with and our co-producer Damien who has been working with us since the beginning of 2021 behind the scenes but there are times in life where we have to check ourselves and we have to go back to the drawing board and make sure that we are on the right path and as the market has tanked it has caused many of us to revisit and reflect greatly on ourselves and what we are trying to achieve in this world,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,and I am no different after years of working my shiny little Charlie butt off to build this I took most of 2022 as an opportunity to go and take the foot off the pedal a bit to go a little bit slower instead of essentially work working from 5am to dinner time and thinking only about work well I started making time for the gym I started making time for social events and going and spending time with family different vacations I started going out to eat I started getting out of the house and getting sunlight I started listening to meditative content I started listening to more philosophy I started thinking and pondering about the purpose of life and how to be more present in it after about a normal day's worth of work I would go every single day and hike up to Runyon Canyon in LA with a podcast on,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

STjYPcVmkoA,so I realized that like with most things in life you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't if I work really really really hard there's a lot of negative impacts with that lots of negative side effects if I don't work at all or if I work when I call not working at all which is like a normal schedule then guess what that's also very very bad because then you have all this extra time where you're just kind of feeling pointless so I thought about this a lot and I came up with the Perfect Analogy that explains what's going on here imagine you are a ship sailing out in Rough Waters on a long long Voyage to a beautiful destination that you really want to get to you may need to dock many ports along the way for repairs and maintenance especially if the weather conditions were bad and trust me they'll be bad but you see that necessary docking period it's only for a short period of time after you dock and after you get those repairs and maintenance it's time to get back out on the water sitting at the dock forever wastes the ship and destroys its purpose we are ships meant to be sailed we can choose to go out on the Seas or sit at the dock rotting away slowly both are very very painful but one one gets you to the destination or at least get you farther to the destination but it is our job to do the best we can and I realized that when I'm dead I don't want people to look back on my life and be like yeah that Charlie guy he kept anxiety out of his life he was very very balanced but you know he didn't do much with his life he never really accomplished much he never pushed the envelope or did anything worth having anxiety for or being out of balance four he'll be forgotten soon and who cares there is plenty of more memorable people out there in fact the Charlie from Charlie bit my finger will always be the more impactful Charlie at least he had the balls to bite that finger folks I want people to say that that Charlie guy he was a massive earthquake and he built something Brick by Brick that inspires tons and tons and tons of people I want people to say rain or shine that Charlie guy showed up in full force it didn't matter if there was a hurricane outside he was there working he was there trying to make an impact he was there trying to do something that could Inspire the next generation of people so with that in mind I am ushering in a new era of zip Trader and I invite you on board to set sail with us we are ready to leave the docks and get over to the next destination my long-term vision for zip Trader is to be the biggest Beacon of stock market Energy Research and education on planet Earth I don't want every single person that comes into contact with us to be made so much better as a result one day I want to look at the next depressed and lonely 15 year old kid who just lost his mom to cancer and be inspired like the 15 year old Charlie was by the stories of others and in order to do that folks we must leave the comfort zone of only being on YouTube and yes that is what the title of this video is all about for the first stage of this though I do need your help I need a way to be in contact with you I need a way to provide you with this new research and this new value that we're going to be rolling out in the coming weeks and months and in order to do that I need your email I've gone ahead and put a link to subscribe to our email list down below and unlock our free research reports that will soon start being sent out on a weekly basis to our subscribers I promise the emails will only contain content that provide value and if you don't like them you could easily unsubscribe at any point but if you have found value in the videos on our Channel I guarantee you you will find Value in these free emails now moving on Final Point how are we going to pay for it as you might imagine this process of expansion is going to be very very expensive it's going to cost a lot of money to provide the next level of products and services and websites and research and overall information that aligns with our goals and all of this is going to happen when I believe we are heading into a massive massive macroeconomic crisis,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,but I believe there's no better time than now to do this and make these Investments because when everybody's being defensive and everybody is yelling to stay at home and people are saying don't go out and build anything because we need to wait well that is the time that you got to strike that is the time you got to build some of the most successful companies in history struck the hardest and actually were built when you were in some of the worst macroeconomic crises in history a few examples Ford GM Disney Visa Microsoft Airbnb WhatsApp Instagram venmo group on Uber Pinterest slack and square all companies that people thought at the time should simply wait until the macro economic environment gets better right now a lot of people have taken their chips off the table and they're like okay that stock market thing that stock market media thing that YouTube thing hey it is not a good idea to build on those right now let's wait until the bull market comes back whereas we we are going to go guns blaming now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,and we're gonna be ready for when that bull market comes back roaring as zip Traders cost of operations scale up in order for us to eventually compete with much bigger finance companies well we are going to need a lot of capital to manage such a big budget it's not like most startup companies we need to raise a lot of capital,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,and it's going to be very very difficult to do it and my goal the next really 12 to 18 months is to raise as much Capital as possible and aside from Investments of Charlie bucks how are we going to raise that Capital well through this business through the wonderful pursuit of capitalism which I love and believe so much in of course we're going to start by building off of what we already have what are the main revenue streams that we already have number one of course is our ZIP Trader you memberships this is our Flagship product which encompasses our very popular daily morning briefings and education in the last month alone we've had over a dozen massive Runners from The Briefing a few examples HKD atnf call a verb h-l-b-z-l-y-t cause them and of course gns which by the way coupon code gns is still active I said that I would expire it if gns didn't make a new high for two straight days and today it didn't make a new high,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,so it might it might expire tomorrow so make sure to get in before tomorrow because it could be the last day of the code no guarantees,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,but I think you're going to see a lot of briefing runners in the next couple of weeks but plug aside we will grow our revenue streams by communicating very very clearly the benefit of having pre-market research of showing up every single day of following Trends we will communicate very very clearly and in nonchalant ways exactly why you should be a member with us and of course also provide insane insane levels of free content for people that don't have the money to join us or aren't that invested in the stock market yet and kind of want to work with us for months or years before they join us number two we're going to have a new educational program and briefing specifically for options this will be headed by our co-producer there are a bunch of opportunities in both Bull and Bear markets and option Traders are some of the best prime for that number three we're going to try to do one sponsorship on each video as frequently as possible in the past we've turned down a lot of different sponsorships because I partially was lazy and Another Part Of Me didn't want to over monetize right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,but one sponsorship in a video is no big deal especially for providing increased level of value on top of what we're already doing and of course I mean if you don't like the sponsorship you could just scroll through with that scroll bar I know you know that hack but of course I don't want to over monetize that it's not a cool thing to do what we are going to be doing is if we have sponsorships we will have less YouTube ads in the videos and you can't skip through YouTube ads but you can skip through the sponsorships with that scroll bar number four awareness campaign so one of the main Revenue drivers of a lot of financial media companies especially bigger ones not so much on YouTube although a couple YouTubers are doing it but massive massive big media companies take what are called awareness campaigns in the past I've yelled about how I absolutely can't stand it when promoters go and they'll talk about a stock they'll say bye bye bye and guess what behind the scenes they're getting paid to say that and they're not disclosing it now that is illegal,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,and it's obviously very very unethical in an awareness campaign you are selling a certain part of the video as an ad space like you would do any other sponsorship,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,and you are clearly and loudly disclosing that it's a sponsorship and the sponsorship itself is of course not a recommendation to buy or sell it's simply just an overview like you would have on any sort of sponsorship and of course these won't be a large portion of any video and it will be clearly disclosed and we'll even put massive massive disclaimers in the description which you legally have to do anyways and finally number five we are going to make extremely extremely aggressive content obviously none of these revenue streams will work if we aren't providing aggressive value that nobody else is so we are going to have to step our game up a lot to be as aggressive as possible to provide you with everything that makes you keep coming back here that means great place that means great macro breakdowns that means short sweet and to the point rundowns on everything that you need to know about the current day-to-day market and we're going to do that on YouTube we're going to start doing that on our email list that we're building out right now link down below remember unlock those reports they're going to start coming once a week starting in a few weeks we're going to build out a website where you're going to be able to find different reports and different information that's going to have different authors slowly rolling out more and more content that's going to help you take your trading and your investing in your stock market participation to the next level all of these things are going to be extremely extremely exciting and I can't do it without you we can't do it without you it sounds cliche,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
STjYPcVmkoA,but it's freaking true this business would not be a thing if it wasn't for you and I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart and I will do everything in my power to take this company to the next level and not let you down and make this company something that you are proud of and you're proud of me and you're proud of everything that we've accomplished I want to look back 10 15 20 years from now on this video when we've built something massive Something That We're super proud of and just remember what it took to get there and also what's setting your mind to a clear goal can do what setting your ship to a clear destination can accomplish folks I appreciate you have a great rest of your day and we'll see you in the next video and we'll see you in the next email email list down below,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ, okay folks so we've got lots to talk about number one we're going to go through line by line the catalysts and market events that are going to be occurring in this coming week then number two we're going to go into the hottest plays and overall setups that you need to know before open tomorrow including a specific 98 cent stock that may be ripe for an increase in the coming sessions okay so let's go ahead and start with catalyst coming this week,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,so earning season is effectively over there's not much in terms of major companies or really small caps that i care about that are reporting in the coming weeks however on tuesday we have the twitter vote on elon musk's offer to buy tweeter at 54.20 cents per share a formal shareholder acceptance vote the price currently trades at 42 so shareholders do have upside if musk is forced to buy it for the original offer but also that involves back and forth and of course highly public lawsuits which are quite frankly more damaging to twitter than they are to elon musk especially with whistleblowers and all a lot of twitter's practices have been revealed and they don't make twitter look very good and on tuesday the cpr report comes out as i like to call it the consumer poverty index at what rate is the consumer being pushed into poverty last month you saw that slow down it came in at zero month over month and eight point five percent year over year which is just atrocious but it's at least cooling down very very slightly right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,and this time it is expected to come in zeroed out again month over month and drop to about eight eight point two percent year over year the biggest single factor that is driving bulls in this market is really that inflation narrative and the inflation is behind us narrative and most of that narrative is pinned on one thing the slight decrease in inflationary pressures that we saw overall in the last report so again if this inflation report does not show a continued downtrend in overall inflationary pressures well that's not going to be a good thing for the market especially because it just rallied in the last couple of days,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,but it is my expectation that inflationary pressures at least for this coming report have indeed continued to cool overall because the energy dump has continued to ripple through each line item however energy and overall commodity cooldowns are not guaranteed to continue through the fall and in fact i would be surprised if they do wednesday you have the ppi producer price index out which is the other crucial data set for inflation markets are looking for a teensy tiny drop month over month hopefully we get that thursday you have the cfvi vote to take social media website rumble public and friday you have triple witching day a day of historically higher volatility because you have stock index futures stock index options contracts and stock options expiring all at the same time it's no quadruple which in day but it can certainly bring higher volume okay before we move on let's go ahead and switch over to charlie with longer hair so that we can hear a word from today's sponsor but first a word from today's sponsor moomoo and the up to 13 free stocks that you will get when you sign up with our link down below so let me ask you this question folks would you show up to the battlefield without the proper weapons,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

CTWUmR3g2VQ,okay moving on to plays let's start with aprn so several weeks ago we presented on the aprn squeeze setup it was following the fifth iteration of a cycle of momentum that we've seen in the last two years at the same time that shorts were covering my thought process was we were looking for proof of concept that the squeeze setup would actually fulfill what needs to happen in order to well actually realize a tradable squeezy mcsqueezy and since our video on the 24th it has had a hero's journey that's taken it back and forth and overall allowed appreciation of 45 to highest as of the end of last week it's now broken past each of the previous three cycle highs and declared a higher resistance deep into the eights its sell-off towards close took it to support that was around where the previous highs had been at which means you have very solid proof of concept in terms of momentum continuing you pull up the short interest short interest as a percentage of free float is now higher than at any point in the last year according to ortex interestingly enough when we last spoke about mr blue apron shorts were in the process of covering which helps start the massive rebound in prices because they have to buy back shares to cover but since then shorts have actually decided to reverse course which is quite juicy and short interest is around double what it was when we covered it last it is now at 53 percent of free float,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,and it's increased nearly 20 percent in the last week alone if that does not make you lick your lips i don't know what does that increase in short interest means that the momentum we've seen is actually even more impressive considering that all of these shorted shares were shares that were dumped onto the market multiple times right when you short something it artificially inflates the supply because you have somebody that owns a stock that you just borrowed it from and you're now dumping it even though that wasn't your share to dump you are creating artificial supply by selling shares that other entities own that just have to be bought back at some point so of course that has a negative impact when you're shorting it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,but when you go and you actually buy back the shares it has a positive impact if the last short covering period from here to here sparked a more than three axing in price imagine what the next wave of covering will do if apron remains a battlefield in the coming weeks we have seen substantial evidence that apron can spike massively when shorts are closing their positions profitably imagine how much apron can spike if they get squeezed so what is my take well the most bullish thing apron can do heading into this week is retain above previous cycle highs and even perhaps sell off temporarily below them before redeclaring above them we call this further proof of concept and the way that i look at proof of concept is it's very similar to flirting if you go up to somebody that you find appealing and you start flirting with them but they show zero interest in flirting back in the slightest bit then that means that the odds of you locking in a date with them or something else is very low at least it's lower than somebody that does immediately flirt back right,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,and it is the same thing with the stock market if you find a setup that is very appealing but it doesn't flirt back with you by showing any interest at all and actually moving where you want it to move then the odds are against you and you should just back off and find another setup that is actually flirting back and showing interest what pisses me off is a lot of traders will go and they'll look at a stock and they'll go right up to that stock and say oh you are so cute oh i want you and the stock will look back at them and say ew you are disgusting get out of my face you loser and the trader will respond by doing what throwing thousands upon thousands of dollars at that stock and they are confused at why they've just lost all that money and why it didn't work out there are quite frankly many fish in the sea of the stock market if one is not showing at least a little bit of interest move on to one that is okay next the stock of the hour,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,mr bbig now mr bbig has been a stock that has provided insane trading opportunities quite a few times over the last year plus but overall it's been a tough horsey in the sense that its overall downward direction has been extremely aggressive and it's been very bar codey and mr barcode mcbarcodey as of the last several trading periods which is generally a disqualifier because it means the liquidity is on the lower side there's not many orders executing unless you get sort of a bar code looking chart which is a problem for dear reasons number one you could get stuck in a position that you can't sell out of and number two it could be more susceptible to manipulation however oftentimes in super small caps they tend to barcode for long stretches of time and then all of a sudden something significant happens and volume and liquidity go up dramatically and for the last 30 days we've been in a situation where bbig is attempting to regain relevancy starting with that mid-august pump it's had a few other attempts at up trending but i believe a bigger more successful attempt is coming in the next few weeks and there's a chance it rivals the mid-august one why you look at the weekly option setup for this week there's a pretty significant concentration in options with strike prices at 150 and two dollars this is a stock that is currently trading at a penny under a dollar right a penny or two under a dollar to have such significant open interest at those strike prices is quite significant because these expire at the end of the coming week and require a more than 50 and 100 run respectively in order to be in the money why would people bet on the stock jumping that much in a week,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,well number one because the probability of that happening has increased dramatically after this random blip in august and after the 30 to 40 rebound attempts very few times across bbig's history have you not seen big rebound attempts in the weeks and months after a massive sudden rally and number two because of the proof of concept it showed on friday and on top of that the market makers that printed these options will likely induce a gamma squeeze if bbig does indeed run this week they sold options expecting a low likelihood of them expiring in the money if that likelihood all of a sudden jumps up rapidly this week they'd likely have to hedge by buying what is currently a low liquidity stock which means that when you're all of a sudden trying to buy something at low liquidity it shoots up the price a lot faster and has an outsized impact on momentum which then would probably attract more spec buyers that would then cause the price to go up even faster now it's my view that there is a positive setup heading into this week if it doesn't run this week i think the setup still looks solid going into the weeks after that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,but you want to see what proof of concept my overall thesis though is hey it wouldn't take much to move the stock there's a lot of people watching it after the recent rallies trying to find and scout out the next rebound rally that takes and of course it has a historical pattern dating back a year plus of massive rebound spikeability you get a massive spike and then all of a sudden you have rebound rallies and then you have a big rebound rally or a new and higher breakout now to conclude this particular segment i know this is a super small cap,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CTWUmR3g2VQ,so i have to make sure that i'm very clear that we were not bribed to talk about this i did not receive a back rub from any company to talk about this although my back is a little bit sore and of course we have no position moving on the other stocks that i am paying close attention to and ones that you likely see in our zip trader you daily morning briefings number one sppi which got an fda approval a nod of approval in the after hours and saw some running will that continue into the week number two mullin which has seen an increase in social media interest which tends to preclude some trading opportunities and number three another review for a hype rally these are some stocks that are top on my radar heading into this week anyways that caps off today's video let us know if you have a stock that you like down below what do you think about this market give us a comment down below and let us know thank you again moomoo for sponsoring today's video get your up to 13 free stocks with that link down below if you want to sign up with zip trader,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

HhIbxORFyCU, okay folks so i got another impromptu vacation video for you today we need to talk about the latest cpi report that came out today and what it means for you and your moolah and then i want to discuss my opinion on what the heck to do about all this okay so the cpr report was nasty with a capital n we broke the slight deceleration in growth rates that we've had since october of 2021's hot 0.9 percent up it went from 0.9 percent to 0.7 to 0.6 and now we're back up at 0.8 unadjusted this is a 7.9 year-over-year increase in prices it's a disaster but what is freaky is that the bulk of energy price increases didn't happen until march which means the biggest inflationary pressures haven't yet been factored into these numbers yet they're still very very hot which is something that we were worried about earlier this week on tuesday's video if you look at energy as a sector it's up 3.5 percent you look at energy commodities 7.6 percent gasolina la la gasolina up 6.6 fuel oil 7.7 all very very hot,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,but it's not nearly as hot as what we've seen the last couple weeks i know that oil has been incredibly volatile and it's been cooling off the last two days from its huge increase but look at the bigger picture here in february oil prices accelerated upwardly all month but we were still much lower than where you started in march for most of the month you're at below 100 a barrel right and for like half the month you're below 90 a barrel in march you're likely going to be retaining support somewhere around and above 100 a barrel minimum,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,and really i don't see anything that is happening right now that points to this overall energy and oil crisis abating what evidence can you point to without russia completely backing down and sanctions reversing that suggests that we won't continue to see an overall upward push on energy prices what is going to make energy prices all of a sudden start bottoming lower and lower is russian escalation in ukraine suddenly done does europe suddenly no longer need oil is the massive global supply that russia provides suddenly not needed on the global scale anymore sure the us which imports relatively little from russia has decided they aren't going to buy from them anymore and instead remake frenemies with venezuela and maduro who the u.s doesn't even formally recognize as the real leader of the country but remember at the end of the day energy prices are benchmarked globally and as long as the massive supplier which is russia is increasingly being cut off from the global market well that supply needs to be made up for elsewhere or it's going to cause prices to skyrocket everywhere and in the u.s whether you blame the government oil companies or a combination for the lack of increase in production well the fact of the matter is that they just aren't increasing production fast enough and even if they were it would only soften the blow i know that the blinded administration has been blaming the recent inflation on sanctions and there's certainly a bit of truth to that even in the february report but remember this is where russia attacked ukraine some of the pricing pressures in oil have been due to anticipating this attack,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,but we were already on a very very strong acceleration in prices for many quarters and you look outside of oil we were already on a strong acceleration in pricing pressures everywhere the massive inflation that we're seeing right now is not just because of russian sanctions in fact we haven't seen the bulk of the results of that yet the massive inflation we are seeing right now is because of a massive massive compounding of a very multi-faceted issue there are so many inflationary pressures that are all coming to heed right now and we're burning because of it i'm never pessimistic over the long run but in the short run it's a very very pessimistic and dreary market condition and i'd be lying if i said it wasn't,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,and we will talk about everything that you need to know about this report some areas that are actually a little bit more optimistic and some areas that i'm very much worried about for the future reports but first i do want to thank public.com ziptrader for sponsoring today's video are you wondering what broker to trade stocks and cryptos on are you looking for a broker that doesn't sell you out to market makers and high frequency traders who often just trade against you are you looking for an app that is free and has no commissions on standard stock trades well make sure to give public.com ziptrader a look i'll put the link below what i like about them is they have a very unique take on the market that includes an intuitive platform and social media site where you can see what other people you follow are buying and selling and the reasoning behind it as well as positions for example if i want to see how people are handling bitcoin in this crazy market condition i can go on my app i can scroll through the trending posts and see who's buying who's selling and what the reasoning is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,and then i can learn something new for myself or if i want to see if people are buying and selling oil stocks i can also see what they're doing and why they're doing it and it's super useful the app even has some ceos and finance leaders who share what their opinion is on the current market condition and even answer questions for example just last month kathy wood held a town hall on public where she answered 24 questions that users had but anyways make sure to check it out you will get a free stock valued up to 300 when you sign up and deposit with our link down in the description below thank you public for sponsoring this video now back to the content food has been hot you have a full percent increase from january to february with food at home prices going up 1.4 percent whether we are talking cereals and bakery products meats poultry fish dairy fruits and vegetables non-alcoholic beverages or as i say boring beverages and other food at home,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,it's all super super hot fruits and vegetables were some of the highest up 2.3 in a month when we were kids our parents would say make sure to eat your fruits and vegetables but now if you eat your fruits and vegetables you could go bankrupt it could be healthy for you but it's certainly not healthy for your bank account i did some digging to figure out why they're so damn hot and it's because not only do they need to be transported very very fast which is very very expensive but produce is one of those areas that takes the most amount of human labor whereas a lot of other areas you can just use machines there's also the case to be made that the cost of fertilizer is increasing rapidly and of course russia is going to be providing less fertilizer to the global market and many people don't even want to buy from russia,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,but if you're trying to gauge what the most problematic areas are going to be in the next report because of the whole russia ukraine situation it's obviously going to be led by oil but there's a whole tit-for-tat sort of situation going on right now with sanctions that is going to only serve to worsen the global supply chain and the global access to a lot of different commodities that russia is a supplier for it's hard to argue that russia doesn't at least deserve sanctions but there is a cost to sanctions and as market traders we need to know about that and going back to what russia exports to the global economy obviously you've got the big ones being various energy commodities,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,but you also have wheat semi-finished iron gold platinum aluminum sawn wood copper diamonds various types of fertilizers which we were just talking about fish and so forth and while the blocking of these things may not have as big of an impact as the blocking of energy exports which are continuing to get more and more blocked via many different methodologies well certainly none of these things are going to help there is always a global benchmark for prices and while some things are less internationally influenced it still has the potential for a huge inflationary impact everywhere but keep in mind the obvious that rising energy costs are the biggest threat here rising energy costs means that costs have to be passed on to the consumer or the companies have to eat in to their bottom line and with inflation outpacing the rate at which consumers are receiving wage increases well eventually this is a collision course to help even before this crisis a lot of analysts had banked on this idea that consumers even though they have less and less money to spend on discretionary goods all of a sudden we're going to come up with money out of thin air to pay for these increased pricing pressures if you're living on a fixed income and your cost of energy and food is skyrocketing huge month over month,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,well how do you pay for other things and if you're a company trying to market goods and services to these people you're not going to have much luck you're going to try to spend money to get them but they're not going to have any money to buy your things they're like okay well i'm going to have to cut back and you're probably gonna cut back on your employees as well which causes a downward spiral and in totality i would argue that we have the very real prospect and scary prospect of a reduction in economic growth at the same time where we have increasingly hard to manage pricing pressures demand might drop dramatically as prices go up and people have less and less money to spend,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,but if there's a massive shortage of basic commodities how are you going to bring inflation down at a certain point you start realizing how stubborn of a situation this is going to be meanwhile the federal reserve is of course set to start draining capital and raising interest rates just as early as next week i saw some comments from folks saying charlie the fed would never raise interest rates into this market environment with this crisis over our heads but the problem is that you have to figure out what type of crisis this is to accurately predict what the fed's response is going to be to this and what type of crisis is this this is an inflationary crisis on top of an inflationary crisis if the fed doesn't even want to raise rates a little bit now we may be facing upcoming quarters with cpr reports that are 15 20 25 30 annualized we are a hop skip and a jump from a much much more accelerated disaster if the fed doesn't do anything right now it's risking running out of options it's much better to raise rates into an economy that is relatively healthy than to wait six months when the situation is much much worse and to raise rates into an economy that might already be falling into a recession and again 100 this is fear and uncertainty talking,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,but this is really what we're facing we're facing the prospect for a higher and higher likelihood unless the situation calms down dramatically and i don't know why it would calm down dramatically that if the fed doesn't do anything we're going to be in a much much worse inflationary situation and even if they do do something we're still probably going to be faced with very very stubborn inflation i do think there's a very strong possibility that in areas of the economy that are more discretionary that you do start seeing some stabilization of pricing pressures like we saw in used cars and trucks this month if you're spending all your money on food and rent and essentials you're probably going to wait to get that new car you're probably going to wait to get that new tv and so certainly there's a lot of pain to be felt in this entire economy if this continues so the next question is inevitably how do you emotionally and really logically and practically handle this market condition and all these uncertainties we've talked about short-term trades and short-term catalysts that we've covered in ziptraderu and on the channel but for people who are buying high conviction long-term plays either on the dip or have been buying it on previous steps how do you handle the emotional uncertainty market downtrends can be short they can be long but they're always very very painful emotionally and they always they always test you obviously inor you have been around for every single market downturn in the market's history but we do have the benefit of historical analysis and all the data being right at our fingertips and i can hammer again on the opportunities that are present in every bad fear-based market opportunities to buy things at deep deep discounts but that would just be me saying what i always say and what everybody says the biggest opportunity right now is your opportunity to learn how to handle yourself emotionally your opportunity to build emotional stamina and stability an opportunity for you to detach yourself from the immediate gratification that the market can often give you during an upcycle but that the market robs from you during a down cycle this market has not only been a downturning market but it's also been a big and dirty tease it gives you massive massive green days on its downturn and it makes you feel emotionally good about yourself like oh things are about to turn around but of course like we saw after yesterday's massive massive rally which was like one of the best days since june of 2020.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,most of these days are just convictionless rallies that end up getting eaten up so that's why this is such a good opportunity to focus on yourself and your emotions when you can look at the market with a blank face whether it's a green or a red day and say i don't care you're preparing yourself to be a killer over the long run people that participate in the worst market conditions are the ones that do the best in the best market conditions and the ones that don't fall for the bs and really since we as market participants can't control where the market goes on any given day or in any given month it's really a good opportunity to learn acceptance hey i accept that i have no control over what's happening over the next two quarters,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,but i have a lot of control over what i do i have a lot of control over what i don't panic on and what i take advantage of and i have a lot of control over the bigger picture that i'm seeing and most importantly you want to say i have control over my emotions and my emotions aren't going to dictate my decisions in this market think about two scenarios somebody who goes and buys a terrible company with a terrible future that's going to fail dramatically in the upcoming five years but buys that company during a good stock market a market that allows it to go up for the next three months after he buys it well guess what that person who probably didn't do any due diligence on the company just made a nice return and feels like he's a genius he got that instant gratification from that kicker and he's probably never gonna sell it either because he's like well i gotta let my winner run he goes around thinking he's the albert einstein of the stock market,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,oh look at me so smart but the problem is obvious the short-term trading of the market if you're a long-term conviction trader does not dictate whether you are good or bad it just dictates what the market is buying right now the supply and the demand there's many many times where the crowd will buy stuff that's complete junk if you build your market prowess on whether the market is giving you instant gratification or not you're going to blow yourself up but what about somebody who buys a good company during a bad market condition and feels like a after it goes down but then waits and waits until it actually starts realizing it's long-term upside well that person is going to learn emotional discipline going to learn humility and it's going to learn patience and when the market inevitably goes back into a euphoria cycle it's going to do very very well this is a market condition that's better than any other to build your emotional intelligence and walk away like a complete beast after this is over,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,and i say this not from a point of oh i'm a beast intellectually i'm a mr charlie man that's really good with the emotions no i'm saying this as somebody who struggles with this myself and aspires every single day to be better sometimes i am better sometimes i revert back you know two steps forward three steps back sometimes but over the long run the goal is to get better and better and to be able to question yourself and why you're making every single move and to be able to make sure that you're acting more and more on logic instead of emotion because really what the stock market is if you're looking at it on a day-to-day basis it's the emotions of the masses the masses are very very bad at making decisions and if you fall trap to them you're going to end up destroyed over the long run,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
HhIbxORFyCU,and you're not going to have a good time the people that enjoy their time in the stock market feel the challenge in the stock market and come out on top in the stock market over the long run or the ones that use logic look at the bigger picture and don't act on what well their emotions especially those short-term emotions anyways folks a little bit of a rant and an impromptu video but i hope this video was helpful have a good one and i'll see you in the next one when i get back to l.a which will most likely be sunday or monday we went down to florida for a week just to kind of get away and get some humidity in the system but we'll be back,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dCgqHKLyeCA,hi friends simon here from informedtrades.com in this video i want to take a look at warren buffett and the methods that he used to develop his fortune through financial markets key points warren buffett is a contrarian he believes uh you know the best time to buy is when people are afraid and the best time to sell is when people are euphoric uh and he looks to to employ that strategy when he's taking positions he's a value investor he wants to buy companies that are trading below what he believes they are worth and hold them you know until they reach their full valuation or beyond that so buffett in terms of i guess the the art element or the analysis element of his approach is very contingent upon valuation uh metrics valuation ratios and sort of you know developing a way where he can say all right a company is worth x right now the price is trading at you know 30 40 percent below what he believes it's worth based on his valuation analysis and and that's kind of opportunity that he wants to buy about the favor specialization over diversification and compound interest is really what he regards as the holy grail to establishing wealth and what he thinks or what he would say is the secret to how he uh you know went from uh being not so wealthy to being uh one of the world's richest people be contrarian so as this chart illustrates um you know most people especially the unsophisticated investor speculator will be most euphoric most excited about buying when the market is at a top uh by the same token when the market is at a bottom uh that is when people will be most afraid of buying people's emotions tend to be based on the most recent price behavior so if they saw price fall decline they'll get scared uh buffett knows or buffer believes in being contrarian this is a common idea especially amongst uh value investors uh you know buying when it's cheap buying when it's out of favor and selling when it's uh in vogue and when it's popular it's sort of uh the name of the game to this style of investing and trading value investing,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dCgqHKLyeCA,so basically once you've developed uh an idea of what you think a company is worth you know based on its earnings based on how much earnings will grow in the future or anticipated earnings uh you have an idea of what what the company can be worth then you look at a company's price and when it's trading below what you believe the company's worth that's when you want to buy that's what a value investor wants to buy the margin of safety in in this school of investing is uh the difference between its current price and what you believe the company is worth so obviously the bigger the gap the better a buy opportunity here is this uh dotted gray line for instance is you know some value investors only want to buy when it's x percent below so let's say 40 below uh what they regard as this fair price or true price so then once it goes below that gray line or below that that target uh margin of safety that's when they buy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dCgqHKLyeCA,and then they sell when it's either overvalued or properly valued when the opportunity has been realized that's sort of the basic approach of value investing and what buffon himself utilizes specialization is uh greater than diversification buffett definitely likes to focus on a few opportunities a few niches and acquiring big pieces of the companies that he does believe in um insurance has been a huge uh area that buffett has invested in through his company berkshire hathaway uh so here on the screen right now you see some of the gains that that berkshire hathaway has earned through its focus on on investment company or excuse me on insurance companies compound interest is the holy grail so this is the chart that illustrates what happens with compound uh interest you know if you invest 125 dollars a month you know eventually you get on a parabolic curve you know that money keeps compounding keeps growing growing compounding upon itself and it uh and it generates significant returns in order for compound interest to really work you need to have a long-term approach it is a strategy that requires a lot of time but eventually compound interest does get you on that parabolic curve so that's sort of the name of the game buffett tends to hold his investments for a long time like many value investors and many investors focused on compound interest it is a really long term perspective that's about it if you have any questions anything you want to share join us over at informedtrades.com best looking trading,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bvHanrTJ6JQ, hi friends Simon here from inform trades calm in this video I want to talk about the key elements of buy-and-hold investing and how that can work of course I should know that buying old investing is not something that everyone is Hannah but if it's something that you think it's your personality or you won't have a long-term outlook some of the ideas are presented in this video maybe it worth considering let's get started ok key points most of the big moves in the market happened on just a few days so it's very important to be in the market when those big moves happen and related to that these big days tend to happen after market crashes so it's important to be prepared to have capital ready but when the market does crash,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bvHanrTJ6JQ,and then they're buying tranches and that's sort of related to the second point especially of just having capital ready for what the right opportunities and when you get into the right time you can really make the most out of a long term hold ok big moves happen on a few days this short here you can see you know at the bottom fully invested in the S&P 500 from December of 1993 or the end of 1993 actually beginning in 1994 until the end of 2013,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bvHanrTJ6JQ,"so basically we're looking at 20 years what happens to you with $10,000 in the S&P 500 and 20 years and you're fully invested you have a 9.2 2% annual return if you miss just the 10 best days you don't you lose almost half that a little a little less than half you lose a little less than half that and then mr. 20 be best days you can see that I mean this is really shocking here you know if you miss the 30 best days you are now at you know you miss 80 percent of the move within 20 a 20 year period so that's pretty significant you can see how important it is to be in the market you know on just the right days now the flip side you know a lot of people argue that bypoll is not a good strategy and you know this sort of plays both ways because if all the moves are happening on the right days and really the best strategy might be to just be in the market on those big days and the not be in the market at the other time however if you're concerned about the ability to time it properly you know the other viewpoint is just stay in the market and wait for those big days now when do those big days occur of course some element of timing is ready and the big moves tend to happen after big days this is a bit of a sloppy graphic here",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bvHanrTJ6JQ,but hopefully it illustrates and we'll just walk through a few examples here the crash of 1987 occurred on October 19th the market fell 20% the next day though October 20th 1987 five point three three percent gain out of this one market crashed in 2008 on November 20th market fall six point seven one percent remember 21st market goes up six point three two percent and this is something short-term traders use as well will they'll wait for a big crash then the  they'll get in they'll close it out after just one day but this illustrates waiting for the big move down you know buy low sell high,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bvHanrTJ6JQ,it's obvious although when the time actually comes can they actually be difficult to act on it because of all the panic going on if you retain your poise if you remember the concept that after a big crash the market tends to rebound that can serve you well over the short term or the long term regardless what your strategy is okay buy in tranches now if you have an Outlook of 10 years 20 years for instance you can still have levels identified that you want to buy it perhaps you want to sell out right now this is December 31st,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bvHanrTJ6JQ,2014 we are looking at a monthly chart of the S&P 500 and if I wanted to really buy and hold now you can see the market that's really runaway leave this sort of identify major levels and this is where you know fluency with technical analysis and just basic ideas of support and resistance measuring Fibonacci pullbacks can be really useful you know you can say well there's a major top here at 1546 we saw that at the turn of the millennium we saw that at the 2007 right before the market crash if the market pulls back that level that could be an interesting level to buy we also see a bottom at 785 you know the market bottoms here in 2003 it barking bombed a little below that in the crash in 2009 2009 so you can sort of identify you know here's one you have a long spike off this level,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
bvHanrTJ6JQ,"so maybe you will have a little bit of capital here in 1837 just to get a little foot in the market have some more capital ready fifteen forty six and so on and so forth so buying transients basically means when you enter you don't put all in you have some capital writing specifically for a market crash and that ties into our previous point right the big moves happen after big down days you want to be ready for those days when they occur if the market crashes to 1546 you want us with capital ready to buy crash to 1,100 you won't have capital more ready but so planning your trade and having a strategy to buy in tranches can fit into a long term buy and hold overall strategy of course like I mentioned at the outset of this video there is a flip side not everyone is in a vine hole investing however it can work it is important ultimately to sell you do have to buy low and sell high so buy and hold is an expression and perhaps not the most useful one because you really do have that you can't just hold forever you do have to sell at some point so identify when you want to sell some private targets and a little bit of technical analysis Fibonacci extensions you know can help with that support resistance and we have of course a lot of information on form trades about that as well just want to give a quick overview some of the key concepts here any questions you have anything you want to add join us at inform that trades com best of luck in your training and we'll see you next time take care",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oq_Uu1nWFnI, hi friends simon here from informedtrades.com next up in our trader profile series where we take a look at successful traders uh and what they've accomplished what we can learn from them is ray dalio uh ray valley was featured incidentally in uh hedge fund market wizards which you know talks to many hedge fund wizards about their or hedge fund traders about their strategy it's a great book by jack schwager i i do recommend that this video it draws from uh from the interview with dalio in that book uh ray dalio is the founder of bridgewater the most successful hedge fund ever if you look at how much money it has returned to uh its shareholders more than any other hedge fund it's also huge over 50 billion with assets under management,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oq_Uu1nWFnI,so it's pretty impressive that they're able to generate sizable returns at that uh managing so much money uh they have a fundamentally systematic approach uh we'll talk a little bit more about exactly what that means dally was a student of history and his uh trading approach really draws upon history uh you know long-term cycles and examining what's happened throughout time taking a very very long-term approach big picture approach is key to his uh to his edge in the markets diversification is the holy grail of investing uh something dahlia believes in and anyone who has made money in trading has had to experience horrendous pain at some point a quote from him on on trading psychology a fundamentally systematic approach sort of what that means is dalio's approach and the approach utilizes bridgewater is very rules based but at the same time it's rude and fundamental so they don't use technical uh analysis at all they do everything's fundamental so it's but since it's systematic it's still numerical,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oq_Uu1nWFnI,it's still you know numbers based so they will look at debt ratio they will look at if a country has an economy as independent monetary policy or not or if the monetary policy is pegged to another country um they'll look at gdp growth rates private sector growth rates versus public sector uh growth rates and many many other economic numbers it's still quantitative but that are reflective of fundamentals so they put these you know these numbers together and sort of create a formula it's a very systematic approach it's unique in that most fundamental approaches are not as systematic as what dalio and bridgewater utilize long-term cycles that's definitely key to uh in history this relates to history it's very similar to martin armstrong in a way or there's an overlap there for instance one long-term cycle which you can see on the screen now is the u.s debt as a percentage of gdp uh when that number gets really high and when it's accelerating really sharply they'll be looking for bubbles and they'll be looking for a great uh an onset of a period of deleveraging where you know there's not gonna be that much asset growth uh and a lot of capital is gonna be spent towards um you know paying off debts that have been run up uh that's sort of the view that dalio has that what 2008 was the year of the great depression and he comes to that view from u.s debt as a percentage of gdp examining cycles there diversification is the holy grail to clarify diversification they don't necessarily mean or they're not really talking about correlation,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oq_Uu1nWFnI,so so you know there's the argument that everything's correlated now so it's diversification is not really possible uh dalio says it is possible and he's looking at what has independent drivers,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
oq_Uu1nWFnI,so you know if two assets are driven by completely different fundamental factors that constitutes diversification on the screen right now as an example u.s stocks versus international stocks they're going to be driven by different factors related to different monetary policies and what's going on in those respective economies and that uh scale also reflects the benefit diversification that that dalio seeks to to achieve uh and that you know once you get to like 15 uh different assets you can really reduce the uh the volatility the risk without necessarily reducing return this chart also illustrates that concept you know you take risky acid one for instance us stocks there's gasket two international stocks or stocks outside the u.s portfolio of both allows you to smooth things out you're not really compromising on return but the volatility of that portfolio is has potential to be reduced need to accept being wrong that's uh really important dahlia's method uh embracing mistakes learning from them is a big part of the culture that's been uh that he tries to implement at bridgewater traders go through pain like you said uh you know successful traders experience horrendous losses uh you know often before they can get to that point of of being very successful it's a common theme with many traders that's about it any questions anything you want to share join us over at informedtrades.com best of luck in your trading,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jTmPD-ksahU, hello and welcome in this video we look at the central bank gold agreement in may of this year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jTmPD-ksahU,central banks signed the fourth central bank gold agreement that goes into effect on september 26th the signing of the fourth central bank gold agreement reasserts by central banks the importance of gold as an asset in global monetary reserves the first central bank gold agreement was created in 1999 and was known as the washington agreement on gold at the time central banks held about 33 000 tons of gold which was about a quarter of all gold estimated to be above ground the central bank gold agreement was created because market fears about central bank intentions on gold caused the price of gold to decrease and become less stable in addition it caused an instability in the value of the assets of central banks this was also causing considerable hardship for gold producing countries many of which were heavily indebted poor countries the central bank gold agreement was signed by 15 european central banks the 11 central banks of the countries that were at the time members of the eurozone and also by sweden switzerland the uk and also the ecb in addition a number of other major holding central banks including the us japan australia the imf and the bank for international settlements either formally associated themselves with the agreement or announced that they would not sell gold with a five-year lifespan a new agreement that contains basically the same language has been signed every five years the agreement stated that gold would remain an important element of global monetary reserves and it agreed to limit the total combined sales of gold by central banks to 400 tons a year they also agreed that their lending and use of derivatives would not increase over the same five-year period in the press release for the first central bank gold agreement on september 26 1999 central bank stated the following quote in the interest of clarifying their attentions with respect to their gold holdings the undersigned institutions make the following statement gold will remain an important element of global monetary reserves the undersigned institutions will not enter the market as sellers with the exception of already decided sales the gold sales already decided will be achieved through a concerted program of sales over the next five years annual sales will not exceed approximately 400 tons and total sales over this period will not exceed 2 000 tons the signatories to this agreement have agreed not to expand the gold leasings and their use of gold futures and options over this period this agreement will be reviewed after five years unquote in 2004 the second central bank gold agreement was signed for the second central bank gold agreement the wording was basically the same as the first one except the limit on the maximum total gold that central banks could sell was increased from 400 tons a year to 500.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jTmPD-ksahU,in 2009 the third central bank gold agreement was signed for the third central bank gold agreement the wording again was basically the same except the limit on the maximum total gold central banks could sell was decreased back down to 400 tons a year and there was a statement about the intentions of the imf to sell gold to several central banks most notably was a 200-ton sale from the imf to the central bank of india for the current central bank gold agreement the wording on the limits for selling gold were changed to state that the signers of the agreement have no plans to sell significant amounts of gold this change was made because during the previous five years central banks went from net gold sellers to net gold buyers,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
jTmPD-ksahU,it was also stated that the signers will coordinate their gold transactions so as to avoid market disturbances which explains why when we look at the graph of central bank purchases the amount of gold central banks have been buying each year is a fairly consistent amount so that is the central bank gold agreement a commitment by central banks to coordinate their transactions of gold because in their words gold remains an important element in global monetary reserves i hope that you enjoyed this video thanks for watching,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Qqzb5NxOGm0,support and resistance support and resistance are probably the two most important words in technical trading support is a level or area with the surplus of buyers that acts like a floor of causing price to bounce off it and reverse resistance is an area or level with the surplus of sellers that acts like a ceiling that causes price to bounce off of it and reverse support resistance levels are based on historical pricing one price stops and reverses it forms a support resistance point there is an increased chance that if price hits the area again it will stop and reverse again furthermore if prices has stopped and reversed in the same spot more than once already if the price hits that area again the chance of it reversing again is even greater sometimes red lines have life support as well what this happens price bounces off of the tread line often price will channel would tweet to support resistant slides with two trend lines what causes support and resistance why this price sometimes seem to magically reverse at the same price over and over again there are lots of different thoughts and theories on the subject however what it comes down to is that support and resistance happens because behind the millions of trades each day are millions of traders markets are not made up of price charts that move up and down at random markets are made up of people people that think and feel and have emotions furthermore markets are not just made up of people but of crowds crowds at very primitive they lose the ability to think individually research for a leader they act irrationally they follow the same patterns and they repeat themselves in short support and resistance happens because markets follow patterns because markets are made up of crowds and crowds follow patterns drawing support and resistance lines is not complicated usually this is achieved by simply connecting two or more spots that price reversed on on either a horizontal or a slanted line there is no one correct way to draw support and resistance lines and when the lines are actually placed as a matter of personal preference some traders will connect the extreme highs or lows like right here others will you just use the bodies of the candles and ignore the wicks and still others although not as common will simply draw the line right through the thickest cluster hoping to get as many people as possible included each trader must find what works best for them support resistors works in both directions when price breaks through support it becomes resistance what price breaks through resistance it becomes support one price is inside the walls on the channel the walls help keep price inside the channel one price breaks through the walls of the channel the walls help keep price out of the channel there are other forms of support and resistance as well whole numbers moving averages pivot points Fibonacci numbers and more typically the more tides price respects to support a resistance level the stronger that level is however the hits a threshold at a certain point where price is respected the area so many times that the area begins to become weaker and the chance of breaking through begins to increase with each new approach as price approaches support a resistance traders will use volume and momentum to gauge whether the field price will break through support or resistance or bounce off in reverse since volume is not available in spot forex traders will sometimes use the volume from currency futures as a substitute as price approaches support a resistance is price gaining steam with the volume increasing or as price losing momentum and volume decreasing the support and resistance lines on a longer time frame chart will be stronger than the support resistance lives on a shorter timeframe chart for instance the support resistance lines on a weekly chart will be stronger than the support resistance lines on a daily chart and the support resistance lives on a daily chart will be stronger then the support resist on an hourly chart the support level on a 15-minute chart probably isn't going to cause the price to change on a daily chart however price on a 15-minute chart may bounce off of a daily support level over time older support resistance lines tend to fade in strength as older traders wash out leave the markets in newer traders enter the markets that were not in the market the last time the support and resistance level was respected so that concludes a basic overview of support and resistance this is the end of the first video on the subject in the next video we'll cover the support resistance price cycle see you then,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

So what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna go through each one in order, and then just give you some thoughts on it. And I suppose, take it or leave it. But like I said, these are the seven investments I've made through the course of my life that really have done me well and greatly benefited me. Number one, by far the most important, your health. If you're not healthy, then you're just setting yourself up for disappointment and failure in the big picture. What do I mean by that? Well, let's say you're not healthy and you still make tons and tons of money. Well, hey, have fun experiencing and enjoying all that money when you're all unhealthy.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"You're either stuck in bed or you take 10 steps and then you're out of breath, or who knows what. But I mean, even if you make a bunch of money still, but you're unhealthy. I mean, what's that gonna, you're not gonna be, that's not gonna be fun. I mean, there's just no fun in that at all. But just from the practical point of view, when you are healthy you have more energy. You have better mind clarity, and that's a good combination. Mind clarity and good energy. That's gonna flow down to everything else. And again, not make anything guaranteed, but the goal here is to shift and put probabilities in your favor. And when you have mind clarity and good energy, you know what? That's going to make things that much more possible to happen. So number one by far, invest into your health and you're gonna reap a whole lot of rewards from it. Number two, which I would say you are already doing right now if you're watching and still watching this video at this exact moment in time, knowledge, invest into your knowledge. What do I mean by knowledge?",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"We'll just get some broad understandings, just be knowledgeable, not an expert in anything, but just get out there and be knowledgeable. Which is why I would say you watching this, you're building knowledge, right? You're learning some knowledge. Now, whether or not you agree with it. That's another talking point. I would respect if you disagreed, but I do commend you, whether or not you agree or disagree with your appetite, your desire to get out there and get knowledge. You are investing into your knowledge right now by investing your time to watch this video. I mean, think about it. You could be investing in using your time right now to watch, I don't know ""The Bachelorette,"" or something like that. I suppose there's some value in there in some form or another. I don't know, but you're not. You're watching this video. But you gotta go get out there and invest into knowledge. 'Cause when you have general knowledge, you can start to fine-tune other areas of these investments as we're gonna see. So let's go on to number three. Number three, your career.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"And there's many little hidden components in this, which is why knowledge comes first. And I'll get to these other components and the other investments that I want you to make. But like I said, when you get knowledge, you're gonna have a good understanding, for example, of well, what actually is a good career? Meaning if you think that going to four years of school at some private university or public university and loading yourself down in debt to get a degree in the history of Roman bobsledding, I don't know if you're gonna be able to make a very good career in that. That's gonna be a hard investment to make. But if you have the knowledge to actually understand how to determine if something's a good career, well then, you know what? You're gonna be in a much better spot. In fact, I will put out two free videos. Now I do offer a personal finance class, but like I said, I released two of those videos from that class for free. So I'm gonna put a link down to both of those.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"That'll make sure that you're not setting yourself up for failure when it comes to your career. So the videos down below are definitely along the knowledge lines of, hey, let's make sure you have the knowledge to actually be choosing the right career and how you're gonna actually get to that career. Especially if you're thinking about going to a university and taking out a loan to do that, because that is debt and you don't wanna let that spin out of control. But number three, your career. Number four, side hustles. It is now time to invest into building multiple streams of income. And it is much easier to build multiple streams of income when you actually have some money that you can invest into doing that. Now, yes, I know a lot of side hustles proclaim, hey, you don't need any money to get started, but that is a joke. Any side hustle worth anything is gonna require some money. Now I'm not saying it's a ton of money, but it is gonna require some money. But again, that's not gonna be an issue. Why, well because investment number three you made was your career.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"And because you have knowledge, it is actually a worthwhile career. That's when done properly, because you have that knowledge, you're gonna have money left over, right? You're gonna have some money that you can use to invest in the side hustles. And again, the idea with side hustles is multiple streams of income. You don't wanna just depend on your career for your only stream of income. Any wealthy person I've ever studied, any, does not have one stream of income. They have all sorts of streams of income. And that is what I want you to be after now investing with item number four. And again, it's four, because at this point you'll have that career and you'll have those streams of income. Now, if you're really young, then things, maybe you'll have the side hustle before the career. You know, you could be out there knocking on doors, for example, and knocking on doors, trying to mow lawns. I'm not saying that's gonna be the career of the rest of your life. That would be more of a side hustle.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"But so, if you're doing that while you're still in school or something then these ones could be flipped around a little bit. But just in general, you wanna be focused on side hustles. 'Cause you want to diversify your streams of income. Number five, it's time to get savage and kill your debt. Now, maybe you don't have any debt. So if that's the case, hey, well done, you get to skip over this one. But it is an investment to pay off your debt. Because when you pay off your debt, well then you don't have to pay that debt anymore. And when you don't have to pay off that debt anymore, you have more cashflow, which cashflow can then be used for the next couple of things that we're gonna be focused on here. But the first dynamic here is we need to kill that debt and we need to invest in getting it paid off as quickly as possible. Which should be very, very possible. When you have a career, when you have some side hustles going on. Like I said, I'm not saying this happens overnight. It depends on just how much debt you have.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"It should be very minimal because up here, knowledge before you did your career. Again, watch those videos down below. They will make sure that this step right here does not spin out of control. I want to reemphasize that again, especially if you're a younger person and you're thinking about going to college, watch those free videos. They will make sure that this situation is very, very manageable. Or, who knows, maybe doesn't even exist at all. But regardless, step number five, investment number five, get that debt out of the way. Number six, investment. Start to get involved in the stock market. Many, many ways you can get involved in the stock market. Me personally, I'm involved in a couple, well, multiple ways, really. I trade the stock market. I invest in the stock market, which are two different styles of the market. And then I also have a teaching business revolving around the stock market too. But the point here being, even if you do none of those, just put some money in the stock market. Put your money in the stock market. You know, you hear the news. The only people getting rich are the investors.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"Well, that's what I'm saying. Invest into the stock market, invest into companies. And I mean, there's all sorts of stuff on this channel about investing and all of that. But you wanna be, again, diversifying. And when you do this, you're creating another stream of income for yourself. Especially if you use certain stocks. I'm not gonna go down that rabbit hole, but point here being, and again, why is this possible? And how can you do it very, very quickly and efficiently? Because you have your career. You have side hustles, you have eliminated the debt. You have money sitting around. I want you to put some of that in the stock market. That's the number six investment. Investment number seven you need to make is send it to Nigerian princes that you get in the email when you have to send it over 'cause if you send them like a thousand dollars, then they're gonna send you like 10 million back. Any spam-y email, that's investment number seven. No, I'm just kidding. Investment number seven, real estate. Real estate, why before the stock market? And I actually did it backwards.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"I did real estate and then I got more so into the market with my longterm investing. So I suppose you could flip these, but real estate is much larger numbers. I mean, when you're talking about buying a house, as opposed to buying a stock, the numbers are different. But again, depending on how these other things have taken place, these could be flipped around, but the moral of the story is the same exact thing. Investing into real estate not only is giving you assets, and in this case, a very nice asset, a physical asset where stock market, those are just intangible. I mean, they're just pieces of paper. But when you're getting into real estate, I mean you can go outside and pick up dirt and that's all real estate is, just dirt, right? You're investing into location, location, location. But real estate, not only is it an asset, it is another stream of income. Assuming again, you're doing it right. But because you know this, you have the knowledge and you're gonna know how to get knowledge.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
m2db-PpRsq8,"So when you get down to that area, you'll know how to get more so the fine-tuned knowledge that applies to just real estate. Then you're gonna be in a much better position possible. So these are the seven investments that I've done and they've made a great difference in my life. They've allowed me to have lots of different freedoms and if you are at all interested in, like I said, taking full control, being able to have that wealth, improve your life, then these are seven investments that I want you to consider to really get laser-focused on, 'cause it will definitely make a difference in your life.

Real quick before you go, I wanna invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you wanna call it. But it will be me live revealing to you what I've discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss. Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total. I'm gonna cover three keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets. The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way. The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use. But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders. I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some. And yeah, the third key, when you hear it, sounds way too good to be true, but it's not. And I'll show you how it all works.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

FPOpBDKjtYk, stock investing for beginners let's talk about how to start smart and get paid so i want to walk you through a little bit of a method here and just a couple of very basic choices that you can make that really add up quite a bit when you stop and think about just how little amount of time it takes to implement these couple of choices here but this video hopefully you can tell from the title is definitely geared towards those that are beginners they're just getting started in the stock market they're understanding the value of investing and now want to start to grow their money build wealth over time so if that is you i can understand it's a bit of an intimidating process up front and you can be i don't can i really do this you can i promise you can do it especially in this day and age of technology but i want to just walk you through one scenario first,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,and then i'll walk you through the the scenario that i would propose you do because like i said for just basically the one quick decision you need to make and to implement this decision it's literally just a second um i think it's gonna be well worth it but the point here being is this will allow you to start to invest and start to you know build your wealth and it's it does not take a whole lot at all now to use this as kind of a reference point about the power of making this little decision and how you can get paid and how actually getting paid makes a big difference within the grand scheme of things what i'm using here is investor.gov right up here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,and they actually have a fantastic compound interest calculator so maybe already have heard of compounding interest you know the power of it if you don't then you're going to see it here real quick but the point here is not necessarily to talk about compounding interest but just to show how if you make one little decision it puts a quite a bit more into your pocket later on down the road so in order for this to all work you are going to need at least 100 but first let's just say that you know what i'm not going to do what you suggest i'm not going to get paid i'm just going to start with my 100 and you can do that if you want,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,but like i said for whatever reason you don't want to take the advice that i give here and you just want to start with 100 so and let's just say that you contribute 100 every month the length of time we're going to be doing this is 40 years remember let's this is investing so this is not going to happen overnight not going to happen next week not going to happen next year this is long-term investing you are looking to build wealth over the long haul get that compounding interest working for you and as far as the estimated interest rate let's just say eight percent i could see people some people saying that should be ten but let's just let's try to be you know somewhat conservative let's just go with eight and then we're gonna come down here and hit calculate,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,and you can see that doing what i just mapped out 40 years starting with just 100 and then every month just adding 100 more that's going to end up and put 313 dollars into your pocket and you can see right there it starts off gotta have some patience but then once that compounding interest basically right there takes into play,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,i mean it really takes off quite a bit however doing this and making maybe not the choice that i'm gonna talk about is gonna hold you back a little bit how so well there might be some instances where you would like to buy a stock invest into an etf or some sort of asset but at the beginning at least you just don't have enough money you're saying i would love to buy fill in the blank stock but based on the price of that stock you know i only have a hundred dollars i can't get started so that's where the first decision comes into play here by using what i'm you know going to walk you through because it will actually allow you to buy a stock that you think is overpriced that you think you can't afford,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,but you can so how is this possible so what you want is what is known as in the world of trading right here fractional shares fractional shares is is very straightforward just to keep the mass simple let's say you only have a hundred dollars which is the premise but you go and you're looking at a stock and the price of that stock is one thousand dollars so yes you would be absolutely correct and with many brokers you would not be able to buy that stock again if the stock is priced at 1 000 and you only have 100 sorry there's nothing you can do but with fractional shares you could go and buy a tenth of a share and the math there is easy you would just take the 100 you would put that over there and like i said just basic basic math here 100 divided by 1 000 would put in you or would come out to let's change up the color there would come out to point one zero,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,so you could buy a tenth of a share now you may look and say a tenth of a share what's that going to do but just think about it at least you were able to get involved with that stock or etf or whatever for whatever reason you found value in it you thought that it would be a good deal it would be a good decision to buy so who really cares how many shares if you can put that 100 to work that's the name of the game and you already saw the power of putting 100 to work 100 and then 100 every month that's going to add up quick but the you know what needs to be able to happen though is you need to actually be able to put that into the market and without fractional shares it's going to be hard to put that into the market for you know because it's going to isolate you until until certain areas in certain stocks because you quote unquote can afford but if you do have fractional shares then you can afford whatever you want so that's going to be the first decision is make sure you use a broker that has fractional shares,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,so that's decision one that you need to make the second decision that you need to make is you're gonna want a tax friendly account you're gonna want an account that at the end of the day helps to shield you in one form or another from taxes and in at least this is more so for american uh members and american uh subscribers of the channel that's where you would want an ira so you're going to want to make sure that not only does your online broker have the ability to give you fractional shares but you want to be doing all this in a tax friendly account and again in america known as an ira which stands for an individual retirement account so that's gonna be the second thing you need to do how to get starts,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,you know how to start smart make sure you can do fractional shares make sure that you can do a tax friendly account and then let's talk about getting paid now before i start with this next one just full transparency full disclosure the way that this occurs is you need to click on a special link that link is an affiliate link so if you do click on it and if you do deposit the 100 which is where that hundred dollar mark is coming from then i will also get something so just to keep that like i said fully transparent but it is an affiliate link but think about how pretty cool this is and i made a comment earlier about how making the decision and then implementing the decision takes just a couple of seconds,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,so how do you get paid well the way this works and the broker that i would and consider you know i would recommend that you at least look into consider is going to be weeble you probably already noticed it on the previous screens but weeble and when you click on the link down below so if you're watching this on youtube down in the description box clicking on the link there that i'll point to or if you're watching at my site claytrader.com we'll put the video or link right down the below the video when you click on that it's going to take you to some promotion now weeble is always changing the promotion but the point here being is there's some sort of promotion that is gonna pay you that it's gonna give you something for signing up with that link so by simply clicking on a link taking two seconds to click on the link you're gonna actually get paid you're gonna make more money which allows you or you're gonna get more money excuse me which allows you to start with more than a hundred dollars and you can see at the time of this recording again this is always subject to change right now you get two free stocks which is pretty cool you don't now you don't know what stocks you're gonna get but two free stocks which you could then get and then sell and you're gonna have more money on top of the 100 now this does require you for you to deposit the 100 which is why i started out with that number anyways,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,so assuming you have 100 like i said you can start and just do the hundred dollars on your own if you want and you'll see that that turned out to be very nice still or you can just start off with a little bit more by getting paid by just like you said make them decision to click on that link so like i said you can click on that link you can use weibull get signed up and now you're gonna have more than 100 now i'm going to find you know try to find a common ground because uh you know to be fair the range there could be more than the amount i use it could be less like i said i'm going to try to play a conservative,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,and i'm not going to assume like best case scenario but let's say that you decide to go with weeble because of the fractional shares because of the ira accounts and because you're like you know what if i can start with even more than a hundred dollars why not so let's see what sort of difference that would make so for argument's sake let's just say that the stocks that you get or whatever promotion they're running comes out to be fifty dollars again it could be more than that it might be a little bit less but let's just say fifty dollars to keep it easy but the point here being is it's gonna be more than one hundred dollars so this is very important because when you talk about compounding interest we're going to go over here and we're going to change this well now to 50 right because you're not going to start with 100 anymore you're going to start with 150.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,now everything else will leave the same we'll leave it at you're still going to do 100 it'll still be over 40 years and it'll still be eight percent but let's see what that actually comes out to and let's do this here so let's bring the calculator here and bring that over because right now choice number one is like i said just a hundred dollars you do nothing more so that's 313.040.27 so we'll keep that number in mind because we're gonna now see what's starting and what clicking on that link would actually do,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,and now you're at three one four one two six so let's do the quick math here so minus three one four one two six dot fifty so look at that one thousand eighty six dollars more which is kind of crazy when you really just stop and think about it literally by clicking on the link and using the link just takes two seconds maybe even a second maybe really fast with your thumbs it takes a half second but just doing that could put over a thousand dollars more into your pocket isn't that kind of crazy when you stop and think about it i mean you're getting paid and then you're getting essentially a thousand dollars more it could be let's just do this i'm just curious now let's say that well no i don't want to i was going to say well let's say you get more than 50 but like i said i'm just trying to keep things conservative but with that you're getting 1086 dollars more by just deciding you know what not only i'm going to do fractional shares so i can get involved whatever,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,and i want this all to happen in a tax friendly way but by just clicking on that link and getting some free stock getting some sort of promotion,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,so i can start with even just 50 more 50 more equates to over a thousand dollars more in your pocket that's a pretty good return on your investment so that is what i would recommend at least considering again i'm not a financial advisor i'm not some sort of i'm not saying that there's anything guaranteed to happen because you know the stock market does not offer guarantees but historically speaking markets have gone up that's always subject to change of course but at the end of the day i'm just throwing this out there as something for you to consider and to show that little small decisions like you know what why don't i click on that link because even if you like weeble anyways you know what if you can just start off with 50 more even crazy to think that just starting out with 50 more ultimately puts over a thousand dollars more into your pocket so like i said click that link down below if you want to you know implement everything here that i'm talking about if you don't that's totally cool too i'm just glad that you're in so excited you're interested,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,you're you know you're seeking out more information on how to get started investing because investing building wealth that is the name of the game that's putting everything into your own hands and that's what i'm a big fan of is if you're gonna build freedom if you're gonna build wealth for yourself then it's best not to be dependent on other people it's best to just depend on yourself so like i said whether or not you want to use the link that is totally up to you i'm still more than willing to help we're we're still friends if you're watching this uh but if you do then hey you just saw the math and saw how it all worked out but weeble great broker offering everything especially those fractional shares to make sure that you can get involved in whatever you want and it's got the you know the ira accounts and by using the affiliate link like i said you can potentially start with uh you know more money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,and then it'll grow just that much faster so hopefully this helps out hopefully this can at least point you in the right direction of the things that you should be considering in factoring in and even if you don't use weibull i would still highly highly recommend that you find something out there that's going to offer the ira accounts and the fractional share purchases those two things are very very important but if you do want to follow this exactly well then i've mapped it out and you know hopefully you decide to to make that decision but like i said at the end of the day i'm just excited you're interested in getting started investing because that's the name of the game that's how wealth is truly built and freedom is established first off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go i want to invite you to a live webinar web class training workshop online event whatever you want to call it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
FPOpBDKjtYk,but it will be me live revealing to you what i discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss including how i had only one losing day out of 73 days in total i'm going to cover three keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets the first key is super weird but in a productive type of way the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our dna as humans making it very easy to use but in a cruel way this becomes a pitfall for many traders i'll explain it all though including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some and yeah the third key when you hear it sounds way too good way too good to be true but it's not,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

CVeNuRzhq9U, hi I'm Jimmy in this video we're looking at the truth about banking we're looking at what drives the banking industry some of the headlines that have come out recently and ultimately how the banks move the economy forward or hurt the economy so recently there's been a lot of news in the headlines about big Banks going out of business for example Silicon Valley Bank I recently did a video on that one you had Signature Bank when when under or at least taken over by the FDIC and then you had a bank like Credit Suisse also get bought out by UBS I believe it was and credit series they were never really a good bank so it's been a while but a lot of banks have had a lot of problems recently so the real question is are we in a banking crisis if we were to look at a lot of the headlines well the headlines would imply that yes we are in fact in a banking crisis maybe not 2008 banking crisis but certainly it's not all Rosie four banks at this point,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CVeNuRzhq9U,but I believe that the actual reason banks are stirring things up or going out of business is because of the way bank's worth the way Banks actually go ahead and make money now if you'd like to better understand what happened with Silicon Valley Bank well I actually did a video just recently on that bank why they went under how they ran into all the liquidity problems that they had I will leave a link for that video in the description below but crucially for all banks this is the treasury yield curve and the key thing to recognize here is the shape of the yield curve we can see short-term rates are higher than long-term rates that's important for bank because what a bank does is they borrow money at short-term rates and they lend money at long-term rates right now they're borrowing at a higher rate than they are Lending,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CVeNuRzhq9U,so they're ultimately going to lose money now I hear what you're saying Banks don't actually lend at the treasury rate and that's really true but let's switch over to the FED funds rate so this is the Fed funds rate the FED funds rate is the short-term rate that essentially the short-term rate that Banks borrowed so they're able to borrow money at this rate now let's say they had a customer let's say a company like a Silicon Valley Bank who had a whole bunch of corporate clients well let's say any Bank wants to lend to a highly rated company and to measure what the interest rate could be we could look at AAA corporate bonds so this orange line is the AAA corporate bond rate over the past year now the way Banks make their money again they borrow at short-term rates that's the blue line and they lend at long-term rates that is the orange line and the spread between those two is the key that's how much money they make for the money that they lend out they that's their profit margin essentially on the money that they lend out but what happens when over the past year that those margins have gradually been squeezed in fact just recently we can see that the two numbers inverted where the FED funds rate was higher than AAA corporate bonds this is a problem you know the reaction that banks will have when they see that well we could borrow money at 4.75 percent five percent we can lend it out for four and a half 400 you don't make that loan you're gonna lose money don't make the loan that is why loans have slowed down that is why banking has slowed down by the way this is very much deliberate and I say it's deliberate because the Federal Reserve needs to get inflation under control to illustrate what I mean let's jump back to the treasury yield curve so this is one of the most recent treasury yield curve now the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates this we know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CVeNuRzhq9U,but they don't increase all interest rates in fact they control the overnight rate the shortest rate we're showing here is a three month one,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CVeNuRzhq9U,but they have a much bigger impact on shorter term rates than they do longer term rates so as they've been driving up interest rates they have inverted the yield curve the purpose of that is to slow lending slow the economy pump the brakes on everything which will ultimately bring down inflation that's it this is all Happening by the Scott by Design now what we need to happen in order for things to normalize banking to continue forward and for them to start making money again or to start making reasonable amounts of money is we need the yield curve to normalize once the yield curve is more normal and that will happen when the Federal Reserve stops increasing interest rates and long-term rates are able to catch up but once the yield curve normalizes banks will stop making a bigger profit when they make a bigger profit for giving out loans to give up more loans more loans lead to more growth in the economy and the cycle can continue so I just wanted to dispel the notion that Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank going under or somehow the Catalyst for banks to stop lending this the inverted yield curve is very much the reason banks have slowed lending in many cases when that goes away that's going to ultimately fix the broader economic situation and hopefully by that point inflation will be under control and the global economy can continue to push forward now we actually recently talked about this exact Topic in a live stream that we do with our private investment community movie where we do different live streams each week we talk about building portfolios talk about what's going on with the market doing research if you'd like to join to get access to the community and our evaluation website,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CVeNuRzhq9U,well I will leave a link in the description below and thank you so much for stick with me all the way to the end of the video I really do appreciate it thank you and I'll see in the next video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_pXH9hS0orY, hi I'm Jimmy in this video we're looking at the top value stocks going into 2023. the stock market's been down a lot this year and I've begun to look for good Investments that could be great long-term Buy and Hold types of Investments so this video is going to be our top five value stocks and right after this I'm looking for dividend stocks and growth stocks so if you have any ideas any good suggestions please throw them in the throw them in the comments below okay now before we jump into that I just want to show you real quick something interesting this is the S&P500 going back the past 20 years and you can see broadly speaking the stock market has done fairly well even with the most recent pullback,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_pXH9hS0orY,but we can actually break up this data from a year-to-year basis and when we do we can see that there's been a few pullbacks for the past 20 years and a couple interesting things struck my attention first each pullback was followed by a big up year the following year which is interesting we don't know what next year is going to bring but if we look at history overall it's done the stock market has recovered quite nicely and one of these pullbacks is the financial crisis the 2007 through about 2009 this is one of the worst pullbacks in the stock markets history it bottomed out at about down 48 49 and yes for the year was down about 37 percent but again it's to me it's interesting how well the stock market has recovered in past years,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_pXH9hS0orY,okay now before we jump into our top five value stocks I want to tell you real quick about an investing platform that we're building so we've got our private investing Community hosted over on Discord on Discord we got a whole bunch of different investing channels where we all talk share ideas do some research projects together and ultimately try to get better as a community at investing we also do a couple investing live streams private investing live streams every week some we do a valuation live stream we do a portfolio live stream where we talk about my portfolio we build the different portfolios plus we do a research research live stream where we try to analyze companies together and go through the process together so we could all get better at it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_pXH9hS0orY,okay now let me tell you about the website that we're building so we already built the beta version of our discounted cash flow calculator and the idea is that we would have a website that has a bunch of different valuation methods so could be how do you value Banks how do you value a large cap company how do you value a real estate company how do you value a company with no growth or negative free cash flow or negative profits there's different ways to Value all different types of companies so that's where the website's trying to go for now we've already got the beta version of the DCF calculator up there we're just going to keep adding from there now if you'd like to sign up to get access to our investing Community as well as the website I will leave a link in the description below okay now let's jump into our top five value stocks by the way all five of these value stocks came directly out of the investing Community we're talking about before okay the first company is called the polti group ticker symbol phm,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_pXH9hS0orY,so the polti group is a home builder they build homes they sell those homes they buy and sell land they build active adult communities they also do some mortgage financing for some of their customers although I checked last year's financials and about 97 of the revenue came from their home building activities we could see that the stock will fairly undervalued it's got a current price right below 50 bucks per share the fair value after debt and cash is coming in at about 71 bucks per share they also have a small dividend of about 1.3 percent so again that looks fairly interesting to me home builders could be really interesting because the housing market has struggled as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates and interest rates have gone up against housing well many housing stocks have pulled back this could lead to a big opportunity because as the housing market struggles well what happens when the FED goes too far and they probably will and then they have to reduce interest rates if they start reducing interest rates once they do well the housing markets likely to recover so if we could jump in and possibly do the research to see if a company like this could be a good buy for the long to buy and hold for the long term well a home builder like this could be a great one,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_pXH9hS0orY,okay now let's jump over to our next value stock this is a Celanese Corporation ticker symbol CE now this one you might see looks a little bit different because I actually did an in-depth video on this company this is a company that is in the chemicals industry and it's a company I really like I actually added this company to my Bullpen I have not personally bought it yet only because I'm actually completing my research on some of their competitors and I want to be able to compare apples to apples but based on my research it looked like an interesting company and perhaps it could be a good fit for your Investment Portfolio now one of the changes that I think is necessary to make to this particular calculation for discounted Cash Flow by the way if I didn't mention this before this is a DCF calculator we talked about a few minutes ago but basically back in February of 2022 Celanese announced that they were buying the mobility and materials segment coming out of DuPont they were going to pay 11 billion dollars in cash for it well that deal closed in November of 2022.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_pXH9hS0orY,so just a couple months ago and interestingly their last quarterly numbers came in at they came in at the end of September so right before the deal closed they we can see have about 9.6 billion dollars in cash but they didn't always have that they had actually gone out and raised money because they needed cash to make the acquisition so on the debt side they went from about 4 billion to about 12 and a half billion on the cash side they went from above 500 million to about 9.6 billion but since we know after the end of the quarter which is where these numbers come from at the end of the quarter they would have had to have paid that money to DuPont so I think a more conservative approach for us to make is to assume that they have none of that cash remaining which means we have to deduct the value of that cash from our current calculation well if we take that 9.6 billion dollars in cash divided by the shares outstanding well we can see we get a fair value reduction of about 89 per share,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_pXH9hS0orY,so when we get the fair value of 246 per share we chop off the 89 per share we end up with a new adjusted fair value of about 157. to me this is a much more logical fair value and compared to the stock price of about 100 per share it looks obscenely undervalued at the current level plus bonus it pays about a 2.7 percent dividend yield okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_pXH9hS0orY,next up we've got CVR energy ticker symbol CVI now this company is actually in the downstream energy industry basically what that means is that they are refiner and marketer of oil and gas and similar related products marketer is you know picture gas stations that's marketing for the oil and gas industry usually these companies end up paying pretty good dividends because most of them are set up as master limited Partnerships so they get tax advantages tax advantages if they pay high levels of dividends now there can be some complicated tax implications for some investors so if this is a stock you're interested in take a peek at that before you go too far too fast but from a value perspective the stock is trading at about 30 bucks per share the fair value looks like it's about 46.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_pXH9hS0orY,now I've only got on on the website we've only got one analyst and according to those numbers by the way those numbers are actually going down the reason they're going down is because many people are expecting oil prices to continue to fall gasoline prices and some of the spreads that refiners need to make more money if those spreads go down they'll make less profit ultimately have less free cash flow but even with that the stock still looks obscenely undervalued or fairly undervalued but there's only one analyst so I think we have to usually I like the more the better as far as number of analysts go I actually double checked and looked into some other places that I thought might have analyst estimates and each of them that I found I found a couple others and each of them that I found were higher than these two numbers so if anything these numbers are a bit more conservative plus like we mentioned before this company has a pretty good dividend yield coming in a bit over four percent okay then we've got broadcom ticker symbol avgo,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_pXH9hS0orY,so we could see broadcom is currently priced at about 550 per share they got a fair value of about 578 per share now they've consistently paid out a pretty good dividend about three percent and they've consistently increased that dividend every year every like they do every fourth quarters they increase it again and the dividend's actually been Fairly reliable for a very long time now for Curious this companies in the semiconductor space and they make a ton of different products spanning the entire semiconductor place and it's a company that I've watched for a long time it's been a while since I did a deep dive if you'd like to see a deep dive let me know in the comments below but I've liked this company for a long time and it's interesting that it appears to be undervalued now okay next we have another large more established technology type of company and that is Cisco ticker symbol,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_pXH9hS0orY,CSCO so we can see Cisco's trading at about 47 bucks per share the fair value is coming in about 61 dollars per share we can see when we look at the number of analysts we have there seem to be a decent amount of analysts covering it so their projections seem the more analysts we have generally the more reliable I think those projections tend to be now Cisco tends to focus in the networking side of Technology picture uh any modems routers things like that Cisco was a lot of different products there they have a lot to do with network security uh they have a lot of software development again this is another reliable company that pays a decent dividend about three percent and it looks like it's trading at a value so this could be one of those similar to broadcom that could be a good long-term Buy and Hold when it comes to value stocks okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_pXH9hS0orY,so now we're going to be working on our dividend stocks and as you might have noticed all of these pay dividends but if you have any good dividend stock ideas or even growth stock ideas that hopefully are also somewhat undervalued the market is down we might as well buy undervalued stocks if you have any ideas please let us know in the comments below and if you'd like to sign up to get access to the website leave a link right here Link in the description below and thank you so much for sticking with me all the way to the end of the video I really do appreciate it thank you and I'll see in the next video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T0yKl98PCCM, hi I'm Jimmy in this video we're going back to the investing basics this time we're looking at what an investing payback period is so we're going to look at what a payback period is we're going to look at an example or two we're going to look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using payback period and ultimately we're going to determine what's the best use for payback period so the actual definition of payback period is ultimately how many years does it take to recover our initial investment so let's look at a quick example so we have company X and Company X is building widgets their initial investment in this project is going to be twelve thousand dollars then what they have to do is they project out over let's say the next four years how much cash flow they think they're going to bring in,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T0yKl98PCCM,let's look at a quick illustration so we can see how the payback period really works so each of these green bars represent how much they expect to bring in in each of the next four years so the question for us is how long will it take them for them to recover the initial twelve thousand dollars that they invested and that's quite simple all we have to do is add up each of the years until we hit twelve thousand dollars in this example we made the math quite simple and the payback period is exactly three years now of course it won't always be that simple if we look at this example well again we start adding up the numbers and we can see in this case well it takes a little bit more than three years call it about three and a half years for them to get their initial investment back the first example we had it and mathematically right at three years but very rarely will that really happen either way this is interesting information to to note ideally the lower the payback period the better,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T0yKl98PCCM,okay now let's jump into some of the advantages and disadvantages of using payback period as a tool to help make investment decisions so on the Advantage side there's two real simple ones first it's simple and easy to calculate it's quick it's easy it's fast simple math will get you there it can also help lower our risk that's another Advantage if we try to stick with Investments that will lower with the lowest possible payback period in theory although it's simple it could do a good job of at least guiding Us in the right direction then we jump over to disadvantages now both of these disadvantages are pretty big ones the first one is that payback period ignores the time value of money let me illustrate real quick so if we jump back over to our chart here we lay out twelve thousand and we're assuming that our investments are going to bring in four thousand dollars each year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T0yKl98PCCM,well it's kind of it's not right to say that the money coming in in year one is worth the same amount in year four inflation alone would likely make that not true money today is worth more than money down the road so the fact that the payback period is ignoring the time value of money is a problem now if you're curious I actually did a video one of my first videos on YouTube on what the time value of money is so if you'd like to learn more about that I will leave a link to that in the description below,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T0yKl98PCCM,okay on to our next disadvantage and this is another big one this one is that the payback period ignores some cash flows it skips them all together let me illustrate real quick once again so this is going back to our very first example and we saw in our first example that if we add up the numbers going in time order well our payback period is exactly in this case exactly three years long but clearly this ignores this fourth year here this fourth year they're bringing in sixty five hundred dollars but what if that wasn't sixty five hundred dollars what if they were in fact bringing in let's say ten thousand dollars so instead of looking like that it looked like the ten thousand clearly the second investment is better but the payback period doesn't change because the payback period starts at the beginning of time and adds up until it hits twelve thousand our initial investment so it really,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T0yKl98PCCM,the the disadvantage for the payback period is it's really ignoring any additional cash flows after the initial payback period but it's also ignoring if the company has to lay out more money down the road that could also be a problem because that would be skipped so now we might ask the question what's the best time to use the payback period keeping these advantages and disadvantages in mind well one place it's not good for is if we're trying to measure profitability we already saw that they skipped some cash flows they ignore the time value money it's not good it's not a good measure of profitability but where it can be used is it could be a good measure of liquidity so let's imagine that we knew we needed to we needed money in three years for some investment we plan on making in a few years well if we know we're going to get our if we expect to get our money back in the next couple years well this could be a simple and quick calculation we use to try to gauge that it could make sense there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T0yKl98PCCM,but I think this works best for let's say projects where we're doing or you know short-term projects not really to measure investment possibilities if we're using this to try to say hey should we invest in stock a or Stock B that's very tricky to pull off and I think we're better off keeping this out of that realm it might be better for internal projects for a company or for a business or for you know home expenses something along those lines now if you're curious about researching stocks or doing more in-depth Dives on companies including coming up with a fair value for those companies I actually did a video called the eight steps to analyze the stock if you'd like to watch that one next I'll leave a link right here I'll leave a link in the description below and thank you so much for sticking with me all the way to the end of the video I really do appreciate it thank you and I'll see in the next video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JdwgN5H3MBw, [Music] welcome podcast listeners we have a fantastic episode for you today last year when we published the best investment writing volume 2 we offered authors the opportunity to record an audio version of their chapter to be released as a segment of the podcast and listeners loved it this year we're bringing the entire volume of the best investment writing volume 3 in podcast format you'll hear from some of the most respected money managers and investment researchers all over the world enough for me let's get to our guests and let them take over this special episode hi guys how are you my name is Justin Carbonell I'm one of the partners at Ville IDIA phylidia is a quantitative investment research firm we run over 20 different investing strategies some based on the approaches outlined by legendary investors so that includes individuals like Warren Buffett Peter Lynch Benjamin Graham Joel Greenblatt and others we also run models that have demonstrated both performance and have been written about either in books or academic papers you can learn more about us at ville idiot com that's VA L ID EA com or you can follow me on twitter @jj,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JdwgN5H3MBw,Carbonell now i'm going to read you my article ten reasons why it's tough to be a true intelligent investor I hope you enjoy it it's pretty amazing when you think about it Ben Graham's tome the intelligent investor still sells over a hundred thousand copies a year as investors of all stripes look to learn the value investing way,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JdwgN5H3MBw,but as Warren Buffett once said value investing is simple but not easy the truth is the vast majority of investors will never be able to become value investors as defined by Ben Graham for the reasons we'll outline in a moment this isn't our critique but rather an exercise in illustrating the many components of a value investing approach and mentality while the list we're going to walk through is by no means exhaustive it captures the central tenets behind what Graham believed contributed to successful value investing number one on the list be an independent critical thinker Graham encouraged investors to think for themselves in mind an intelligent investor wasn't the smartest guy in the room but instead the one that used a fact-based methodology and was able to control his or her own emotions Wall Street Journal columnist Jason schwag who updated and provided commentary for the third edition of the intelligent investor neatly summarizes this he writes quote the components that are needed in the character of an intelligent investor are patient's independent thinking discipline eagerness to learn self-control and self-knowledge end quote by being an independent thinker there's a good chance you won't be influenced by the consensus and you will come to your own conclusion based on the facts the vast majority of investors rely on others to form their opinions the so called market experts are busy giving their daily market predictions Graham preached forming conclusions based on cold hard numbers and believed that following the advice of the forecasters was always a bad idea number two on the list maintain a contrary and mindset Seth Klarman founder the value oriented firm Bob Post group called value investing quote a marriage between a contrarian and a calculator end quote for Graham and most other D value investors the contrary anism comes through and buying value stocks which are often stocks that investors are negative on for one reason or another I mean look at the top stocks driving the market today Google Amazon Facebook Netflix these may be great companies but they are the furthest thing from the type of unloved stocks that would fit the mold of being contrarian as a true contraire you have to have a chance to find opportunities that maybe mispriced where the market has potentially overreacted and become too negative on them,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JdwgN5H3MBw,but if you are a true contrary in you will most likely endure significant pain and getting there because the market may not agree with you in the short run number three on the list is we have to accept the future is largely unknowable former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld once said quote as we know there are known knowns there are things we know we know we also know there are known unknowns that is to say there are some things we just don't know but there are also unknown unknowns the ones we don't know we don't know end,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JdwgN5H3MBw,quote Graham understood the future was largely unknowable and then investing in the stock market came with uncertainty and risk he wrote quote the future itself can be approached in two different ways which may be called the way of prediction or projection and the way of protection and quo by staying away from predicting and focusing on protection Graham gravitated towards stocks of companies that were so cheap that even if the future was worse than expected there was limited downside in their price and this plays into our next point which is finding stocks with a margin of safety buying shares of companies that had a margin of safety was a central concept in Graham's investment approach the margin of safety was intended to provide downside protection in the event that the future profits of the company deteriorated because Graham believed the future was highly unpredictable and that earnings of companies were also highly variable he favored stocks of companies that could be bought at or below their net asset value to determine this he would take a firm's current assets and net out all liabilities this formula effectively gives you the price a buyer would pay in the event of a liquidation and assigns no value to long term assets for companies valued at or below this level it was implied that there could be upside as the business improved and also limited downside in the event that the business didn't improve number five on the list you got to be willing to put in the work if you've ever picked up the intelligent investor you know it's a daunting book over 500 pages in small eight type font security analysis Graham's first book was even longer at 725 pages the thoroughness in the books reflect Graham's thinking that to fully educate yourself on the markets and value investing it takes a lot of time a lot of work and a lot of effort Todd combs one of the portfolio managers handpicked by Warren Buffett to manage part of Berkshire Hathaway's public market portfolio one said that his daily work schedule is quote literally just reading about 12 hours a day and quote the bottom-line investing takes a lot of time energy and continuous learning and it's difficult for many of us to have the patience and interest in pursuing what it takes to become knowledgeable on the markets and how to become a true value investor investors need to think more like business owners and that's number six in Berkshire Hathaway's 2013 annual letter to shareholders Warren Buffett wrote about two small real estate investments he had made one an investment in a farm in Iowa and to a building New York Siti both proved to be good investments for Buffett but that really wasn't his main objective in sharing the information with us what he was trying to emphasize is the importance that when you're buying an asset such as a stock or a piece of property you're actually buying into the business and you're entitled to the future cash flows generated by those assets Buffett writes quote stocks provide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas yet to see a quotation for either my farm or my New York real estate investment end,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JdwgN5H3MBw,quote the concept of looking at stocks as pieces of business was something grand emphasized continuously and Buffett credits Graham for helping him think of investing as a business owner rather than just a stock certificate holder in the intelligent investor Graham wrote quote investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike he went on to say a corporate security may be best viewed in the first instance as an ownership interest in or claim against a specific business enterprise end quote although they should most investors don't take that businesslike mindset when investing in the stock market coming in at number 7 and this is difficult for many investors is maintaining a disciplined and systematic investment approach Graham specifically promoted a quantitative approach to investing a quantitative method provided more protection in Graham's mind because I offered a disciplined unemotional way to buy a group of value stocks that over time would have the potential to outperform qualitative investing approaches according to Graham and evolve forecasts and predictions which he believed represented a speculative way to invest that would lead to poor results in chapters 14 and 15 of the intelligent investor grandma aligned to different investing strategies using specific and concrete fundamental and valuation criteria the first was the defensive investor method and this is a strategy we run on video it includes things like looking at the size of the company whether or not the company has a strong financial condition its earnings record and lastly multiple valuation metrics many investors aren't wired to follow a systematic investment strategy but in Graham's mind this was the best chance for long-term success in the market in the number-8 slot his investors should realize that stock prices are there for your convenience only Graham wrote that stock prices were there to be quote taken advantage of or to be ignored,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JdwgN5H3MBw,end quote investors he wrote should never buy stock because it has gone up or sell a stock because it has gone down rather they should determine the price they are willing to pay for it based on the underlying value of the business and then make rational decisions on whether to buy or sell a stock buffett drove this point home with his famous saying quote price is what you pay values what you get end quote the price of a stock can fluctuate wildly based on the latest headlines and the flow of money in and out of it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JdwgN5H3MBw,but in the long run it's the value of the underlying business and the future cash flows of that business that will reward you as a shareholder as long as you bought the shares at a sensible price and didn't overpay for it number nine is simply invest don't speculate Graham considered himself an investor he wanted to find companies with certain fundamentals and buy their stocks for the long run speculators as Graham labelled them didn't care about the value of the business their only concern was whether the price was going up Graham also believed that anyone who is making a business out of forecasting either the market or company-specific earnings was engaging in a type of speculation and this would manifest itself in poor future returns in Chapter 1,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JdwgN5H3MBw,Graham differentiates investing and speculating this way he writes quote an investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principle and an adequate return operations not meeting these requirements are considered speculative and quote Graham was obviously skeptical of all the predictions and forecasts from Wall Street and that's the last point is although it may be tempting to listen to arm waving pundants singing the praises of certain companies or predicting where the market is going to go tomorrow it's important to understand that it's impossible to predict the short-term movement of stocks in a video posted by one-day analysts at the Motley Fool they said build your portfolio around understanding that market drops will happen but invest in such a way that won't let those drops get to you so that you'll continue to stay focused on the underlying businesses behind the stocks in your portfolio because in the long term the performance of those businesses is in the end what will drive the performance of the stocks you own so becoming an intelligent investor as grant outlined may sound simple on the surface but it's far from easy still I think investors can learn and grow from all of these points and for those who recognize and overcome the many hurdles that the market and our own emotions throw at us I think can only help in your long term investing endeavors thank you for listening I hope you've enjoyed this [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

w45SXUzZ3ro,hi I'm Rob Arnott founding chairman of research affiliates were best known for our work in smart data and asset allocation with about 180 billion in assets managed worldwide using our investment strategies we're a bit unusual we're singularly focused on research and product innovation and we work with distribution partners to make our ideas available to the marketplace so we deliver solutions in partnership with distribution powerhouses like PIMCO footsie SSG a Blackrock legal in general Invesco and Nomura to name just a few these firms bring our ideas to their end clients through mutual funds ETFs separately managed accounts and other vehicles so is one of the pioneers in smart beta in 2005 we introduced the research affiliates fundamental index also known as Rafi as an alternative to traditional market cap weighted indexes the fundamental index weights companies based on the size of the business not based on the popularity of the company not based on how much the market value is not based on how extravagantly expensive the company is so we weight companies based on measures like Book value cash flow dividends and sales thereby severing the link between the price and the weight of a stock in the index the Achilles heel of cap weighting is that it links the weight directly to the price so that the price doubles the made in the portfolio also doubles and that means that you are inherently overweight all the overvalued companies and underweight all of the undervalued companies even though you can't know which companies are which Rafi offers a contrarian approach that under weights overvalued stocks and favors out of favor more appropriately valued stocks as such it does have a distinct value tilt and it works remarkably well in most market environments in which value is winning which hasn't been the case in recent years but boy values gotten awfully inexpensive,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
w45SXUzZ3ro,lately so I think this is an interesting strategy for folks to look at today we also offer single and multi-factor indexes we also do a lot of work in asset allocation to learn more about us and to sign up for our research insights feel free to check our websites at research affiliates comm and Rafi our AFI com I've been asked to read you an excerpt from a piece that we published a year ago entitled yes it's a bubble,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
w45SXUzZ3ro,so what I wrote this with my colleague Shane Shepherd and with Brad Cornell professor emeritus at Cal Tech back in April of 2018 but it still applies today in fact we've just written a follow-up article bubble bubble toil and trouble which you can access on our website again the website is research affiliates com let's dive right in the excerpt reads as follows the relentless rise in the u.s. stock market since its low in 2009 has been dramatic US stock market valuations now exceed all historical valuation levels except for those hit at the peak of the dot-com craze this raises an obvious question for investors is the US stock market in another bubble the answer is yes the more important question then becomes how should investors react we recommend for actions that investors can take in response to current bubble conditions which should allow investors to benefit from the bubble what constitutes a bubble to answer these questions let's begin by offering a definition of the word bubble we all hear the word thrown around carelessly and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
w45SXUzZ3ro,but it lacks a formal definition we define a bubble as a circumstance in which asset prices 1 offer little chance of any positive risk premium relative to bonds or cash using any reasonable projection of expected cash flows and 2 they are sustained because investors believe they can sell the asset to someone else for a higher price tomorrow with little regard for the underlying fundamentals notably there are markets in which few if any buyers care about the discounted future cash flows to value an asset the 1999 to 2000 tack or dot-com bubble is the poster child for a broad market bubble at the height of this bubble aggressive assumptions were required to believe that the entire US stock market would deliver a positive risk premium relative to then prevailing bond and cash yields for the tech sector in particular to deliver a risk premium compared to the 6% bond yields available at that time most tech stocks would have had to produce rapid growth far into the future even though a few could have succeeded unless their fierce competitors were also struggling in hindsight using our simple definition the tech bubble was indeed a bubble and could have been identified at the time more importantly many observers in the midst of the bubble correctly perceived it for what it was at the beginning of 2000 the 10 largest market caps tech stocks in the United States collectively represented a 25% share of the S&P 500 Microsoft Cisco Intel IBM AOL Oracle Dell Sun Qualcomm and Gila Packard didn't live up to the excessively optimistic expectations over the next 18 years not a single one beat the market 5 produced positive returns averaging 3 percent a year compounded far lower than the market return and two failed outright of the 5 that produced negative returns the average outcome was a loss of 7.2 percent a year compounded or 12 and a half percent a year less than the S&P 500 eerily similar to the new economy dogma of the dot-com bubble is today's cryptocurrency craze it boggles the imagination to hear people speaking of investing in Bitcoin an electronic entity that offers no hope of future off operating profits or dividends is little used as a surrogate for money in transactions offers an uncertain longer-term use case and has no objective basis to determine its fundamental value how many investors are holding cryptocurrencies for any purpose other than the expectation that someone else will pay a higher price at some point in the future we see a bubble in the US stock market today albey albeit less extravagant than the growing swarm of cryptocurrencies reasonable observers can disagree but we believe we are experiencing a tech bubble based on a relatively rigorous definition of the term at the end of January 2018 the seven largest market cap stocks in the world were all tech fliers alphabet Apple Microsoft Facebook Amazon $0.10 and Alibaba never before has any sector so dominated the global roster of the largest market cap companies now let's focus on how investors should react in response to a bubble a reasonable first step is to sell or great really reduce our holdings of bubble priced assets the two most dangerous things about a bubble are that one markets can go far beyond any objective valuation measure and two investors can never know with any confidence when the bubble will pop in the market will turn whereas a bubble is not as hard to identify in real time as is commonly perceived transforming a bubble into a profit even for investors who correctly discern it is a tremendous challenge because late stage bubbles can take valuations into the stratosphere investors can actually provide their own most appropriate response to a bubble by answering a very simple question how much shortfall can I tolerate for two consecutive years without panicking each investor has a unique threshold for at risk the difference between their managers performance of the performance of the managers peers above all whatever bets we take should not be sized to succeed our clients tolerance for maverick risk we recommend for actions of investor can take to protect themselves and even benefit when the bubble eventually bursts first an investor can materially reduce or eliminate their exposure to bubble assets if we cannot construct a reasonable scenario in which the bubble assets could offer an acceptable risk premium the greater fool rationale someone will pay more for it later resembles picking up nickels in front of a steamroller at a minimum we can underweight these assets second an investor can seek anti bubbles in the market and invest in them anti bubbles are sectors or markets priced at levels that cannot plausibly deliver anything but a large risk premium an anti bubble cannot exist in a single asset because almost any assets price can drop to zero but consider junk bonds financials and consumer durables in early 2009 these asset classes weren't going to disappear each failure of a single company meant that the survivors in that sector had less competition higher margins and a clear runway collectively the sector itself couldn't fail to deliver a very large risk premium firing a handful of genuine Armageddon scenarios emerging markets value stocks in early 2016 were a similar example wrathy the fundamental index in emerging markets fell to a Shiller p/e ratio of 5.6 times earnings an earnings yield of 18% in a world of zero yield bonds and cash emerging markets value was an obvious anti bubble similar to the trajectory of a bubble an anti bubble continues to collapse until it doesn't until it turns therefore averaging into our positions with an eye towards not exceeding in it our investors tolerance for maverick risk is a prudent way to invest an anti bubble can be a rich source of profit for the patient investor third an investor can diversify into investments that are not in bubble territory for example as of early 2018 emerging market equities and many developed countries stock markets are trading at discounts to their historical valuations rather than the extravagant premium of the S&P 500 as a paper by Arnott kolesnik and masters,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
w45SXUzZ3ro,oh entitled Cape Fear noted many arguments been advanced to justify a Shiller price earnings p/e ratio also known as a SiC quickly adjusted p/e or Cape ratio of 33 times each of these arguments applies equally to the European and emerging markets which both sport Cape ratio is less than half as expensive as those in the US market other markets offer better places to take on market risk seek them out fourth an investor can remember lessons learned from past bubbles such as the collateral damage done to the technology led cap weighted indexes the S&P 500 was savaged in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble down 23 percent over the 24 months from March 2000 to March 2002 on its way to an eventual 49 percent decline just six months later today in the US stock market value stocks are trading it quite an attractive level especially in comparison to growth stocks this is even truer in international markets and the growth value spread in emerging markets is very near an all-time extreme if investors significantly reduce equity allocations away from traditional market cap exposures especially in the United States and into value based smart beta strategies especially in the half-priced European and emerging markets they are likely to enjoy significant in insulation against the next eventual but inevitable market downturn one final note I'd love to see us transform the industry from a fixation on past returns and performance chasing to a focus on forward-looking returns and a willingness to buy whatever is newly cheap our AAI asset allocation interactive and SBI smart beta interactive websites are free our intent on exactly this focus and give people an interactive way to explore their investment options check them out at research affiliates comm /ki and research affiliates comm /sb,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

b-OkhwQO1wU, [Music] welcome podcast friends we have a fantastic episode for you today last year we published the best investment writing volume four we offered authors the opportunity to record an audio version of their chapter to be released as a segment of the podcast and listeners loved it this year we're once again bringing you the entire volume of the best investment writing volume 5 in podcast format you'll hear from some of the most respected money managers and investment researchers from all over the world enough for me let's get to our guests and let them take over this special episode,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b-OkhwQO1wU,this article is titled value investing an examination of the 1000 largest firms by jack vogel of alpha architect among stock investors a common strategy and belief held is value investing which is buying stocks that are relatively cheap on price or fundamental ratios the idea behind why value investing works is that value stocks are either one riskier and or two have been mispriced by the market so in theory these elements of risk or mispricing lead to expected above market returns however this strategy has failed over the past couple of years causing many to doubt or question what is going on with the strategy given the recent underperformance there have been a lot of articles written about the so-called death of value investing some of the articles that examine this question is value dead have examined the performance of two well-known indices the russell 1000 value index and the russell 1000 growth index these are widely referenced in the industry are market cap weighted and have returns going back to 1979.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b-OkhwQO1wU,since value is supposed to be growth over the long run how have these indices performed the performance from january 1st of 1979 through july 31st of 2020 of the russell 1000 index the russell 1000 growth index and the russell 1000 value index highlight that value has actually lost to growth over this entire time sample so as a value investor that is a disappointment to say the least and digging deeper let's look at the performance over the past 10 years the market or the russell 1000 returned 13.85 percent whereas russell 1000 value returned 10 and russell 1000 growth returned 17 and almost 7 differential between value and growth over the 10 years ending july 31st of 2020 and when we look at that on a compounded growth chart the returns are very painful examine in the past one three and five years we see that value has lost to growth by 35 over the past one year through july 31st 2020 by almost 18 percent compounded for three years and by almost 11 compounded for the previous five years and so in a lot of people's minds value investing is dead but let's take a step back for a moment what exactly is value investing it is simply trying to buy stocks that are cheaper when compared to other stocks but now what does it mean for a stock to be cheap let's look at a simple example pretend that there are only four stocks in the universe in which we can invest we are going to simply look at the firm's earnings each year and compare that to the price one would pay if they bought the entire company such as like the firm's market cap this is called the simple price to earnings or p e ratio so in my four stock example i have four stocks that all have a market cap of one thousand however stock one has earnings of a hundred stock two has earnings of fifty stock three has an earnings of twenty five dollars and stock four has an earnings of ten so the price to earnings ratio on stock one which has an earnings of 100 and a market cap of a thousand is 10.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b-OkhwQO1wU,whereas stock 4 which has earnings of 10 and market cap of 1 000 has a pe or price to earnings ratio of a hundred so in my four stock example stocks one and two traded a lower multiple of earnings relative to three and four so a systematic value investor who only uses pe multiple would prefer stocks one and two compared to three and four as a shopping example stocks one and two were on sale compared to stocks three and four because all four firms had the exact same market cap but firms one and two make more money so they are value or cheap stocks of course my example above is very simplified and we are only looking at one point in time number past year's earnings it may be the case that firms train for growing at a faster rate and we can create more advanced models to try to figure out the best investment however if that were the case an expert can create better models then active managers wouldn't lose to the market around eighty percent of the time over five years according to spiva studies so academics have studied how value stocks perform relative to growth stocks in general they use the book value of assets divided by the market cap of the firm as this was the measure used in the seminal 1992 and 1993 family and french papers and what they found is that value stocks outperform gross stocks so in the original paper falm and french highlight that this is most likely compensation on for taking on some additional risk really to underscore the fact that this is not a free lunch of course one can use other measures to identify cheap stocks such as price to earnings or book to market we examined different methods in a paper that wes and i wrote a couple years ago looking at also free cash flow and ebit to tev however the big picture takeaway is the following value beat growth no matter which metric one used so back to our russell 1000 example why then does the russell 1000 indices have growth beating value over a pretty substantial time period 1979 to july of 2020.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b-OkhwQO1wU,so part of this is the construction process that they use here are the three variables that are used to create the russell 1000 growth and value indices the first is book to market the second is medium-term forecast earnings growth rate based on the ibis two-year forecast ibis or analysts the third measure is sales per share growth rate based on five year historical sales now without making any judgments as to whether or not this is a good or bad process what one should note is that this methodology is definitely different than the simple example above which was simply splitting the firms on the pe multiple or like in the original value papers book to market or our preferred measure ebit to tv so what would happen if we went back and tested splitting the 1000 largest firms on a simple pe multiple over the same time period to answer that i dug into the data i annually rebalanced the portfolios on june 30th of each year using the firm's market cap to identify the 1 000 largest firms firms earnings values were brought in as of 630 each year using annual data while only examining data as of 331 each year this is done to eliminate the so-called look-ahead bias that can occur when looking at back tests so all the portfolios shown in the main text are market cap weighting or evaluating in the academic parlance so the first thing i did was ensure that my universe of the 1000 largest firms reasonably matched the returns to the russell 1000 index so over the january 1st 1979 to december 31st,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b-OkhwQO1wU,2019 time period i had a correlation of 9.9983 and the returns were 11.98 for the russell 1000 index and 11.87 for my universe so what this highlights is that the data is pretty good based seeing a very high correlation amongst the two,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b-OkhwQO1wU,so next i then split the universe on one simple variable on june 30th each year price to earnings multiple so firms trading at higher multiples of earnings were deemed to be growth and firms trading at lower multiples of earnings were deemed to be value the results that i find are listed below the cheap half so basically the 500 cheapest stocks again this is market cap or valuated portfolios but the cheap half of firms returned 13.16 whereas the expensive half returned 10.39 percent again a spread of almost three percent over a 40-year period between value and growth and to drive home an important point here given our universe is a thousand stocks i really am only doing once a year a very simplistic split to 500 cheap firms and 500 expensive firms using the pe multiple and then market cap weighting the portfolio this is very simple nothing else is done those 500 stocks are then followed for in a portfolio for one year to generate the returns to the value portfolio and the growth portfolio and looking at a compounded growth over a 42-year period we highlight and see that a hundred dollars invested into value would have generated about 16 000 at the end whereas a hundred dollars invested into growth would have generated about 6 000 at the end so this is what three percent differential compounded over 42 years occurs and thus the difference is not negligible since i already have the data i decided to additionally split the universe into tersiles which is three groups quintiles which is five groups and deciles which are ten groups and what we see is over the 1979 to 2019 period as we go further out from tercel to quintile to decile the value growth differential widens so when we split the universe in half we had about a three percent spread when we split the universe into third we have about a four percent spread when we split the universe into five we have about a five percent spread and when we split the universe into ten we have almost a six percent spread so in general the more one tilted towards value factor moving from tersiles to quintiles to deciles the larger the spread between value and growth however it needs to be highlighted that this performance is definitely not a free lunch this is not guaranteed and is not a free lunch as i showed at the beginning of this article the past 10 years and especially the past five years have not been very kind to a value investor thus a true value investor needs to be aware of this and understand the risk,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b-OkhwQO1wU,so what about recent performance now while the data i had in my back test went through december 31st 2019 what happened in 2020 for a value investor using these simple price to earning splits for context this article was written and the data ended as of july 31st of 2020. so to study this i updated the data through the end of 731 using factset and i built portfolios as of 1231 2019 what one sees is that value definitely continued its under performance this year i showed the performance in using these pe splits of quintiles and tertiles using market cap weights so using quintiles as an example from january 1st of 2020 through july 31st of 2020 we see a definitive edge for growth investing as the pandemic occurred in early 2020.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b-OkhwQO1wU,the most expensive quintile returned about 25 whereas value stocks returned negative 25 this is an almost 50 percent return differential between value and growth in the opposite direction where gross stocks outperform value stocks over a seven month period by 50 percent thus value investing can massively underperformed growth investing at times so now what happens if we append the 2020 data over the long run does value still be growth using this very simplistic pe sample,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b-OkhwQO1wU,so i now update the sample from january 1st of 1979 through july 31st of 2020 once again using my simplistic split on the pe multiple one time a year what we find is that value still outperforms growth by over two percent over this 42 plus year period so where does this all leave us well the longer i've been in the investment industry i've noticed that people tend to fall in different camps or religions when it comes to investing a couple of them are the following first vanguard investors who look for market cap weighted portfolios and low fees second dividend investors these investors like to invest in firms paying higher dividends than other firms third value investors they prefer to buy cheap stocks look for deals fourth are growth investors these are always looking for the new innovative stocks in the marketplace now maybe the best outcome for investors and advisors is to match themselves up and their clients with portfolios they feel comfortable with and can trust the process this simple study highlights first one simple approach to value investing and two its performance in u.s stocks over a 40-year period other studies have also shown that over long time cycles and across multiple asset classes and using different measures value investing has beaten growth investing however it definitely will not work all the time and this is actually probably required for it to persist in the future to conclude value investing is a simple concept trying to buy stocks trading at lower multiples of earnings or fundamentals in the past value be growth investing but it will not work all the time thank you for listening,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6aHbIaQAxXg,[Music] last year we published the best investment writing volume four we offered authors the opportunity to record an audio version of their chapter to be released as a segment of the podcast and listeners loved it this year we're once again bringing you the entire volume of the best investment writing volume 5 in podcast format you'll hear from some of the most respected money managers and investment researchers from all over the world enough for me let's get to our guests and let them take over this special episode i'm amy koh from research affiliates a firm known for its work in smart beta and multi-asset investing with a focus on research and product innovation we at research affiliates partner with leading financial institutions to bring our ideas to you through mutual funds etfs separately managed accounts and other vehicles to learn more about our research insights interactive tools and more drop by at researchaffiliates.com and raffi.com i will read a piece titled a quick survey of quote-unquote broken asset classes introduction pundits prognosticators and even investment boards often make misleading declarations that an asset class is broken that its prospects for earning investors a reasonable future return are very dim these proclamations can lead to investors abandoning these assets to chase recent winners advisors are uniquely positioned to educate their clients about historical asset class returns and to provide context for recent perhaps disappointing performance in this way advisors can prepare their clients for substantial variations in an assets returns a prepared client is a confident one and confidence begets the tenacity to hold assets over the long term raising the likelihood of a successful investment experience via diversification rebalancing and long-term compounding and isn't that what financial advice is all about warnings of the long-term impaired viability of asset classes have spooked investors through history one of the most notorious was businessweek's cover story the death of equities published in 1979 u.s stocks are not alone however other quote-unquote broken asset classes abound by the late 1990s reits were dismissed as losing the power to diversify a portfolio and a 1999 article in the economists concluded cheap oil is likely to remain so fast forward 20 years to the present headlines team with sentiments such as does investing in emerging markets still make sense and is value investing dead it might be and here's what killed it so history is littered with examples of reputable pundits media outlets and prognosticators cautioning investors about broken asset classes typically at the heels of sagging absolute returns or poor results relative to mainstream markets similar warnings also occurred during investment board meetings in his consulting days john recalls back in february 2000 a board meeting of an 800 million pension fund recent market movements namely growth stock outperformance had pushed the fund's asset allocation out of compliance with its investment policy statement requiring a larger balance out of growth stocks into core bonds and small cap value the resistance to the mandated rebalance was unsurprisingly for those who may have lived through this period stiff with one board member stating that small cap value is a dead asset class indeed it appeared the board preferred to eliminate small cap value rather than top it up fortunately the investment policy statement compelled the rebalance to go through and to this day john will tell you it was one of his most rewarding experiences in investment management given the absolute dollar value created for the funds members as growth stocks plunged small value stocks surged and bonds steadily advanced during the bear market that eventually culminated in late 2002 when headlines lead to clients questioning their investment strategy we suggest advisors use comprehensive historical return ranges to most effectively gauge recent results on an absolute basis and relative to a mainstream asset such as u.s equities that is the S&P500 index we will review how seemingly impaired assets are rarely permanently defunct in most cases the performance of a broken asset class is well within its range of historical returns and outperformance often follows a period of underperformance as mean reversion takes hold clients benefit from a greater understanding of the potential long-term upside in recently beaten down assets the broken asset classes before delving into our review let's begin with a few caveats first our selection of broken asset classes is far from exhaustive in making our selection we relied primarily on a global roster of historical articles published in the well-established financial press including businessweek barons the economist and financial times if your own experience includes other asset classes that have been declared broken please let us know second the headlines or conversations that question the long-term viability of an asset class represent just one opinion or voice at that time alongside those who warn and question others may have presented an opposite more favorable view contrarians are often an endangered species but rarely extinct given our survey's purpose is to show how broken asset classes typically mend themselves with time our sample emphasizes the former these are the same troubled asset classes that grab the headlines grip the attention of investors and lead to tough questions for advisors from their clients and finally we are restricted by the availability of return data although we use well-known proxies with an extended return history few asset classes other than u.s stocks and high-yield bonds have a monthly series longer than a half-century a notable example is emerging market stocks in our study we use a return history for em stocks that begins in 1985.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6aHbIaQAxXg,now a time span of just over three years is a relatively short time in the capital markets and while results may not be statistically significant they can be economically meaningful ultimately our survey includes seven asset classes beginning with u.s stocks following the infamous death of equities article published in august 1979 and ending with a similar chorus of claims surrounding value investing and em stocks 40 years later so at this point i'd invite you to see a table in our article which shows the list of asset classes and other relevant information used in our sample what constitutes broken all seven of the broken asset classes in our survey posted poor performance over the three years prior to the warnings that they were impaired before we declare them broken however let's take a look at their performance in the context of each assets long-term history both in absolute terms and relative to mainstream u.s stocks the warning date we use represents the month in which a published article or live conversation strongly questioned the long-term viability of the asset class now three-year performance results leading up to the warning date generally hovered near the lower ranges of long-term outcomes at the time of the august 1979 warning about u.s stocks their uninspired five percent annualized three-year return had slumped into the bottom quartile of returns since 1926.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
6aHbIaQAxXg,approximately half of the group commodities high-yield bonds and value stocks generated negative returns that fell within the worst decile of each assets long-term historical three-year rolling return these are disappointing infrequent outcomes but they are not atypical or improbable broadly performance results relative to the S&P500 tended to be more severe than absolute outcomes suggesting that anchoring on mainstream assets is pervasive for instance three asset classes reits small value stocks and em stocks managed to deliver returns slightly above their long-term median levels in the three years preceding the declaration's warning that they were defunct but when viewed relative to mainstream assets all three suffered relative shortfalls trailing u.s stocks by up to 14 percent a year over the three-year period preceding their respective warning dates they are not alone every asset class in our subset except for one trailed the S&P500 in the three years leading up to the warning date the three-year relative losses of four of the five stragglers fell into the worst quintile of all historical outcomes with two in the bottom decile so despite alarming warnings of the impaired viability of asset classes the performance of broken asset classes is not particularly exceptional generally falling within the normal albeit bottom range of return outcomes mean reversion and missed opportunities far too many investors focus on the rearview mirror and react to fear-inducing headlines doing so incurs the risk that investors will miss good opportunities markets are supposed to pay a risk or fear premium to reward risk bearing perception of risk and fear tend to go hand in hand asset classes get sold down to bargain levels because people are fearful and as our colleague rob arnott regularly says when risks and bad news are known to the market and fears prevalent it's time to buy what's out of favor unloved and legitimately creating fear fear-based anomalies persist because their genesis is in humans primal impulses in the five years after an asset class was declared broken each roared back in a strong and for many swift rebound all except one snapped back within one year generating returns that ranged from 14 for u.s stocks to 68 percent for commodities the sole doddler reits rebounded in 18 months ultimately delivering a cumulative 86 percent return at the five-year mark the weakest performance of the group we recognize the substantial survivorship bias in our survey having personally survived most of these episodes ourselves so to be more comprehensive we also plot other periods when these asset classes fell within their lowest decile of historical three-year rolling absolute returns a similar pattern unfolds a large majority or 88 percent of all observations deliver a positive five-year return the average five-year cumulative return across all observations is eighty percent or approximately twelve percent a year suggesting both the presence and strength of mean reversion how do the asset classes perform on a relative basis recall that the broken asset classes in our survey had mostly fallen short of the performance of the S&P500 in the years leading up to the proclamation they were broken in the subsequent three years these asset classes surpassed the performance of u.s stocks on a cumulative basis by an average of 45 percent or 13 a year after five years the cumulative excess return of reits commodities small value stocks and high-yield bonds versus the S&P500 averaged 101 percent or 15 percent a year over this five-year span the four asset classes fared significantly better than u.s stocks with cumulative access returns ranging from 10 percent high yield bonds to 158 percent for commodities the press is often quick to label asset classes broken but rarely is this the case although exceptions do exist for instance the german and russian stock markets during world war one japanese and german stock markets during world war ii and the egyptian stock market in the early 1950s all collapsed the near obliteration of a stock market has happened but it is an extraordinary occurrence the advisor's role we are hardwired to pay attention to headlines with fear-provoking warnings it's easy to fall prey to now casts and believe that what's already happened is a forecast of more of the same while such predictions may sound cogent they rarely offer insight our simple survey of broken asset classes reveals the following observations first warnings of the impaired viability of asset classes tends to be exaggerated the three-year performance leading up to the time that an asset class is pronounced broken is typically within the normal albeit wide range of historical return outcomes and second returns are time varying and rebounds can be strong after assets are either declared broken or declined to their lowest historical decile of three-year outcomes the majority or 90 rebound within five years the recovery also tends to be meaningful the average cumulative five-year subsequent return across all observations is 80 or 12 a year our primary point is not to conclusively say that bottom decile performance will be succeeded by brilliant subsequent returns our survey is simply not comprehensive and even if it was the future will not exactly mimic the past rather our intent is to highlight how the advisor is uniquely positioned to prepare clients for the wide range of absolute and relative returns that capital markets will inevitably throw at them in most cases parroting mark twain reports of asset class deaths are greatly exaggerated but sadly these misleading proclamations can lead to investors abandoning these assets to chase recent winners these types of poor investment decisions can be prevented however with proper preparation such as educating clients about historical asset class returns to provide context for recent perhaps disappointing performance this is particularly important with diversifying assets as compared to the more traditional asset classes of stocks and investment grade bonds by definition the role of diversifiers such as high-yield bonds and commodities is not to mimic mainstream markets like the S&P500 actor richard klein once said confidence is preparation everything else is beyond your control recent spans of market tumult has certainly taught us that returns are well outside of our control but an advisor can prepare their clients for substantial variations and in assets returns and obtain buy-in for these wide and ultimately unknowable ranges a prepared client is a confident one and confidence begets long-termism and long-termism helps tune out the noise and raises the likelihood of a successful investment experience via diversification rebalancing and long-term compounding and isn't that what financial advice is all about,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b380H8wqUnE, [Music] so if you look at the fed funds rate and then subtract the year-over-year inflation you'll see that we're in a spot today that we've never been historically and a lot of people look back 40 years ago because we're talking about inflation today that is in the range that we were at 40 years ago and what they don't realize is that it's worse than you think so the inflation the way it was calculated 40 years ago was based upon housing prices and housing is about a third of cpi today we've got this smoothed version of owner equivalent rent and if you did the apples to apples comparison where you calculated inflation like you did in 1981 the rate would be 12 or 13 percent and we're looking at the 8.5 percent now the reason i'm mentioning this is your particular example so what was the fed funds rate in 1981 20 and a half meb any guess rob just gave away the answer plus i was only five so i,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b380H8wqUnE,i i would have to go to the 19 [Music] see all you had to do back then and then and just buy some zero coupon bonds and go away for 40 years that was the right trade at that point so can i throw in another dynamic that is kind of below the radar screen and that is that i believe that the fed is constrained today way more than the early 1980s because in the early 1980s the debt to gdp was about 34 and today it's over a hundred percent so as the fed increases the rates it increases the debt service cost in a way that is is magnified by a factor of four uh compared to the early 1980s and given we're already in a deficit a situation a serious deficit situation how do you pay for that extra interest you actually monetize it and the fed's got to be thinking that if we push the rate too high we actually could feed further inflation and that wasn't true in the early 1980s here's a fun thought experiment i suppose powell channels his inner volcker and says volcker took the rate to an all-time peak of 20 and a half ever so briefly inflation correctly measured is about the same as it was back then i'm going to do that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b380H8wqUnE,okay if you have 20 interest rates if that migrates its way into the overall cost of capital for government because keep in mind raising the short rate doesn't boost the cost of servicing government debt except over time as the debt rolls but if the debt were to roll into a 20 yield just bear with me if your debt is 100 of gdp that debt service costs you 20 of gdp 20 of gdp is 100 of the tax revenues the feds work with 100 so the entirety of tax revenues would have to go to servicing debt zero to any of the things that the government does that ostensibly make our lives better [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,So Yesterday obviously ended red which suggests there's still a lot of fear left in the markets that's absolutely true we don't yet know what we're going to get for our February March and April data but what happened to financial conditions something Jerome Powell let the Federal Reserve pays a lot of attention to and what happened to our Breakeven inflation rates because what I'd like to see is as the stock market turned red and the 10-year treasury approached four percent what did Financial conditions do our financial conditions properly and potentially adjusting for the pain that we've already seen in January data and is that potentially enough to keep our stock market from lagging even lower well let's take a look this particular chart here is a chart of the Goldman Sachs Financial conditions index and the financial conditions index is made up of the value of the dollar the value of stocks the value of housing the value of a treasury bonds it's a little bit of everything a lot of it is based on the value of the treasury yields so let's go ahead and see if we have any kind of Trends here so first of all it's worth noting that right now we are sitting at Financial conditions that are as high as what we last saw at the end of December remember when everybody was basically paper handing for tax loss harvesting,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,well that's roughly where we sit right now at a scale of financial conditions tightness we're sitting around that December paper handing level however we're not sitting at the levels of financial tightness that we saw in September and October and this is where we really started seeing Financial or inflationary surprises and we potentially really started bottoming in a lot of stocks a lot of stocks saw their bottom in Q3 2020 uh um two now is it possible that October did end up marking the bottom aligning with the tightest Financial conditions yeah it is possible unless of course we get more inflationary surprises in the Feb March April reports which obviously come out April uh it will come out March,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,April May anyway if we get worse reports we're going to zoom up we'll probably see the stock market test those bottoms and so that's kind of interesting if you align again the bottom of the stock market with financial conditions you can see why have we been read the last two or three weeks here Financial conditions have been substantially tightening uh and at the same time we've had this alignment the 10-year treasure yield has tightened to the tune about 60 basis points that could move mortgage rates in the real estate market up probably somewhere around 60 to 75 basis points as well if we Google mortgage rates right now we drop to our usual 740 credit score so we have a consistent look folks we are back at where are we we are right back to the seven percent credit score almost sitting at 7.1 or not for a credit score 430 your fixed rate mortgage that's pretty dang high and this is symbolized and brought to us by the financial uh a Goldman Sachs Financial conditions report so this is something we're really going to have to pay attention to but what we'd also like to pay attention to is that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,well I'd like to say that that Financial condition's tightening could be a sign that the Market's already trying to take care of that January hot data for us so the Market's already at work and as long as we don't get worse data in February which comes out next month in March maybe the pain that we just went through will end up being temporary now though let's also look at the five-year break evens how are we doing on Five-Year break-evens because five year Break Even suggests to us,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,okay is inflation going to get worse or are we topping out on inflation so we'll just in this portion here Focus specifically on what Financial or what five-year break-evens or the Market's predictor of inflation have been telling us for the past year and that's very important because we know we are well above where we were when the FED last pivoted in uh in 2018 at the end of 2018 where the five-year break evens were sitting about 1.6 percent we were trending in that direction in January but unfortunately the January data really ruined everything here is the chart of the five-year break evens and if we go ahead and draw a similar line over here so let's go to our tool and grab a line here what do we have what we have is a five-year Break Even level that has peaked out about last week maybe somewhere around Monday Tuesday and we're sitting at levels that are at the same inflation expectations of what we had roughly at the beginning of December so really we're relatively stable there if we wanted to draw a larger downtrend we can although that downtrend is not as perfect as what we've previously had where it started to look like we were almost breaking the downtrend that we had had a nice downtrend here and unfortunately that somewhat broke here so the downtrend just isn't as quick as what we had been hoping and that's really to say that inflation's probably going to take a lot longer to bring down than we were expecting and that's why we're seeing some of that red here the good news is we've somewhat peaked again on those inflation break evens and that's fantastic,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,so maybe this is a sign that we're not going to get back to that 4.3 treasury yield we're not going to get back to that level of uh of of inflation uh that we saw previously and maybe just maybe we could stabilize now there is a thesis uh that uh hey we're going to end up doubling double dipping with the next reports but at least now could it show hey things won't be as bad as what we saw going into Q3 where we had uh these these break evens sitting closer to 2.7 percent or potentially the break-evens that we saw in October well maybe since we're peaking out slightly lower than where we were in October maybe the worst is behind us in terms of looking at the chart temporarily thanks to the January data again we look at the January data and we kind of compare it to where the NASDAQ has been we zoom out on the NASDAQ we look at a Fibonacci retracement you saw where we were on the break evens look at where that puts us when we look at the NASDAQ for example this is the chart of the QQQ we have now perfectly retraced uh on the NASDAQ to our Fibonacci level one up from zero here right now this is very very interesting because it's almost like we perfectly got rejected at our second level on the Fibonacci and now here we are at falling right back to our support which is the second level now in terms of a percentage for retracement it's worth knowing that we got rejected at the 38.2 percent retracement what that means is when we take when we say that the high of December of 2020 or November in this case of 2021 is the peak and the bottom is potentially November or excuse me October of 2022 then we retraced 38 we've got rejected and we fell to the next level which is at about 23.6 percent right now at least from a technical point of view it seems like Financial conditions have tightened enough to where we should be okay in terms of tightness given this hot January data we got we have break even yields inflecting down which suggests maybe we could have a slow bounce off of this 28 Fibonacci level in my opinion a reasonable trajectory on a technical basis going forward here could be a slow continuation of the trend that we've that we've had slow though very slow so for example if we if we look for a trend here I think probably one of the best places to draw that might be here let's see what this looks like let's kill that let's draw a new line over here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,let's see if we can get a trend over here if we suggest hey when could we potentially get to the 50 retracement line on a little bit more of a patient Trend it might take us until about June and in my opinion this trend line is a reasonable trend line to pay attention to and it really shows us a ceiling for those higher Highs coming off of the bottom and that suggests maybe still bouncing around not yet breaking that 38.2 percent line until look at where that break lines up from a chartist point of view that break to a leg higher breaks right here March 21st now why is that so interesting from a technical point of view fomc meeting folks the fed's fomc meeting is on March 22nd,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,this means from a technical point of view for the next three to four weeks maybe we'll trade sideways leading into that fomc meeting where we'll get CPI and jobs data but the market will mostly care about how is the Fed reacting and responding to that and if the FED continues on sort of this dovish path even though we lost Leo Brainard from The Fad she's gone over to be the director of the National Economic Council she took Larry kudlow's job well his previous job somebody else is there now you know Mr v-shaped recovery anyway that's the NEC so Leo Brainerd left she was the one of the biggest doves at the fed and now she's gone you've got a pretty hawkish fed actually right now but you're even seeing some of the Hawks like Master say look once we get to five percent uh we're good like I mean maybe we have some more small hikes to do but the leading data we're seeing from businesses and companies we're talking to which by the way reiterates what I'm seeing in earnings calls and reports at companies is that the tightening is happening what you're seeing it especially with some lag especially with the quantitative tightening still ahead of us,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,but anyway potentially from a technical point of view we could bounce off of the 23.6 NASDAQ Fibonacci level here which is basically where we closed that level to tell you exactly is 289 64 we closed about two points above that at about 291. so but we did touch that intraday we almost perfectly touched the Fibonacci Fibonacci intraday in fact if we look at the lows I was about 40 cents off pretty close anyway is it possible that then we have this sort of volatile uh volatility maybe a slow Trend up with volatility going into March 22nd and then a breakout around March 22nd which is what the at least for me my technical point of view is pointing out yeah and then the next resistance level is really going to be that 50 Fibonacci in which case this trend if it holds could potentially say it's going to be June before we actually break that 50 Fibonacci level right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,so it's interesting we'll see but from a technical point of view I think the retracement that we just had over the last three weeks is not a confirmation that we're back to a longer term bear Trend mostly because if you look at the longer term bear Trend we've already broken that right we're we're look at that we're literally sitting on the 200-day moving average as support and we're not anywhere near that longer term bear Trend which would suggest longer term uh or second leg lower right so from a technical point of view which by the way I talk about technical analysis a lot as well in the stocks and psychology of money course linked down below along with all of my other courses you can bundle up biggest the most popular are stocks and psychology of money zero to millionaire real estate investing followed by the elite Hustlers course which we have an elite Hustlers live stream coming up after this video uh those are linked down below with a flash sale going on now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Gii-o98VwIs,and you can learn about everything that I know in my perspectives over there but from a technical point of view I'm not very bearish right now if anything this is a moment right here I'm actually tempted on Monday to potentially pull the trigger on some option trades uh we are we we're talking about those a lot in the live stream yesterday so if you're in the course member stream you'll see exactly which particular stocks are really Prime for this option trade based on volatility analysis and now based on a technical analysis on the NASDAQ we could look at some components of the NASDAQ and maybe pull off uh some some uh some good uh yield farming so to speak on Monday,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,hey everyone me Kevin here in this video I want to explain why I'm making a 13 million dollar acquisition for my media business and why this is really scary where the money is coming from and why I'm doing it first I want to give you a very clear lay of the land in 2022 has been a very difficult year I've let some of the minor uh noise that is very very loud but it's still hate affect me personally because I'm the kind of person that wants ultimately everybody to like me but unfortunately when the market is going into a recession you can't get that there are going to be people who are upset they need to point the finger at somebody else and even though I'm trying to do my absolute best possible they're going to be haters in a recessionary environment and unfortunately I've let a lot of that get to myself but when I zoomed out and put life into perspective this actually became a lot less important for example a good friend of mine's spouse had cancer for 18 months they went into remission and then all the the sudden we're told now they have a new form of cancer abdominal lining cancer and they have six months to live it's terrible if anybody has any recommendations for like any kind of clinical trials or any kind of support for these kinds of situations please hit me up in Twitter DMs second thing that happened this year was I contacted my insurance agent about eightish weeks ago always gets back to me always answers my phone calls really great guy hard worker and a few weeks ago we call and find out he died suddenly died of a brain aneurysm I'm like what this is so Eerie then third thing that happened is my uncle whose initials are PP Peter paffrath had a heart attack this year it was like 35 minutes away from a hospital because they live in a smaller town fortunately survive,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,but it really put into perspective that you know life is about the journey and life is about making sure we have the proper balance of success and effort and family and uh that we're able to pick up where there are failures and keep moving with one foot in front of the other and we can't let the noise of of hate or criticism or whatever get in the way of that so I realized that for me similarly expand the three businesses that I have a media business a an ETF and the house hack I need to be able to give my all to these businesses and I realized that my media business and my ETF kind of fold into one envelope they fold into research and content production they're roughly the same because the research we do for Content production could be roughly the same research that we use for ETF allocations decisions which um you know obviously these These are decisions that that need to be made by consolidating all this information together uh in in a way that sets us up for the best possible 2023.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,now what's really important that I found is that between the hours of about 4 AM to 11 I'm constantly working on making content producing videos and actually able to provide value on the internet that's how I believe that in the future we can create a neutral kind of uh financially directed Ben Shapiro show you know I think he does a really great job he's got the daily wire they've got like hundreds of employees and I think they have you know they tilt to the right and I'm really trying to tilt towards the middle how can I cover politics and finances while remaining as neutral as possible that's my goal but the problem is if I go travel like I did a few months ago I traveled to Miami to go look at real estate and I was there for about three nights and I realized I go gosh it's so hard to produce content while I'm spending three hours getting to the airport at LAX after three hours getting to the airport the flight's delayed an hour baggage is getting lost so I just don't do baggage anymore,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,but if you carry on and you don't go like first class or Premiere what happens they potentially check your bag at the get at the Jet Bridge and then you have to go get your bag from there anyway ah right uh and and then you land and you you land at massive airports where now you've got to get a hotel because you can't get a round-trip commercial flight the same day because those just don't exist and so all of a sudden you look and it's like my gosh the the amount of impediments to actually producing content which is one of my very important pillars of my three businesses producing content me Kevin right gets heavily impeded if I'm sitting in traffic if I'm sitting at airports if I'm delayed on an airplane waiting for this thing to leave it doesn't make sense I can't operate both my real estate startup househack which I think knock on wood and I can't make any guarantees okay you have to go to househack.com read the solicitation there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,but I think I personally with the commitment I make to househack over the next six years I think I can 10x the value of househack uh again no guarantees I personally believe that so my view is hey even if I make zero money next year because I take all my money from my media business and throw it back into uh things that enable me to do the best possible job for my media business and for househack I think I can make that 10x reality I want to ring the stock ballot Stock Exchange again but with househack on an IPO for potentially a billion plus dollar company like that makes me so excited that potential and so I'm really really excited about like expanding house hack and becoming the best real estate company to exist in America I really think I can pull it off,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,I don't think any other company does wedge deals the way I do because it's hard and it's really because the owners are not the ones looking at the deals you have Executives at Invitation Homes that are like hey go spend the money to you know people may be making fifty thousand dollars a year and they're just sort of like all right looks good let's just buy it and rent it out and it looks good on a spreadsheet but nobody's actually doing wedge deal analysis on these nobody's actually looking at how can we minimize evictions you know knock on wood I've never had an eviction,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,so uh I I personally believe that investing everything I can into these three businesses is critical but in order to do this I need to have the second half of my day where I can travel and get back same day that way I could spend time with family or I could take family with me or I can make sure I'm back in time for for the evening to to spend some time with family and then the next morning I can focus on my media business as well or again I should say and therefore I've decided to purchase a small uh and the most eco-efficient plane that I could find it is a jet it is uh probably the most economical jet that you could buy when it comes to fuel efficiency which I'm very excited about it is a twin engine jet the safety of a twin engine Jet piloted by two pilots in a business Aviation slash Charter uh style of flight is is extremely high it's safer than driving now you want to separate uh business or commercial Aviation obviously from like you know people just yellowing it on little propeller planes on the weekends those are scarier much much higher accident rate so we think we're getting into something that's very very safe it's a newer model of plane it's a 2021 the one that we're looking at which we're very excited about it does mean that potentially we're buying a little bit over market value because I do think we're going into a recession,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,but I do have tax reasons for making that happen this year again if I can offset five six million dollars of taxes this year and I'm financing the plane with about three million dollars down the plane actually pays for itself for about one to two years which is really really cool and it will enable me to maximize my time growing my media business and maximize my time growing house hack see the cool thing is the following let's say I want to train a crew of um let's just say eight people so I want to train eight people how to be really good at analyzing wedge deals and learning areas with me uh and maximizing their understanding of buying wedge deal real estate well if I took everybody on commercial flights we're probably looking at least at 400 round trip tickets for eight people plus hotel costs we're probably looking at 200 bucks a night per person,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,right so we're probably somewhere around 4 800 bucks for eight people plus Ubers and food costs and miscellaneous expenses plus the opportunity cost of me not being able to film the next morning all of a sudden it becomes a really really really expensive to try to fly around commercially with a bunch of people that I'm trying to train in real estate whereas on the flip side if my core business my media business says you know what we will own the plane the media business is going to own the plane it's going to pay for the core expenses for the plane what are the variable expenses for the plane possibly as low as depending on where fuel costs go next year possibly as low as as low as again depends on fuel as low as a thousand bucks a flight hour well now all of a sudden if I make a two hour round trip from here to Salt Lake or I should say two hour one way and then two hours back that cost me about four thousand dollars in variable expenses and I get to leave with a 15 minute notice 15 minutes from here to the airport hop on,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,and I'm back really really easy I can also fly into smaller Regional airports that generally commercial flights don't go into I'm avoiding hotels I'm avoiding extra costs of all of these additional people needing to be in hotels and fed and all this stuff so really and I'm able to be back in the office the next morning to be filming in my studio to provide value and content so all of a sudden four thousand dollars for a potential round trip same day for eight people works out to about five hundred dollars per ticket when the reality is I'd probably be spending a thousand to fifteen hundred dollars per person trying to scoot them around and then you gotta figure if we're gonna be there for more days scoot them around to hotels or food and Ubers and all this mess,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,it's so complicated the the projections that we're doing show that there's no way I could grow house hack and run a full-time media business if I have to fly commercially and take half of my day trying to drive down to LAX and then take off from LAX and I'm losing all these days it's just not feasible so I've made the business decision to take my media business and use my media business as the ownership company of this plane so I'm going to spend about 13 million dollars buying a plane take a massive write-off which will pay for this plane for about a year or two uh then I'm going to use this to maximize my ability to create content on the business side on the media side but also be present for househack,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,and I think this is critically important now I want to be so Crystal Clear house hack right now has almost all of its money tied up in treasuries short-term treasuries that are yielding us net net about 50 000 a month that means all of our house hack expenses subtracted we are up fifty thousand dollars a month doing nothing right now at house hack house hack investors should be proud they should be looking at this going damn doing nothing and up 50 Grand after all expenses yeah it's freaking awesome because we're making sure to manage that money perfectly and househack is not paying for this plane I want to be very clear about that I know initially some people are gonna be like oh my gosh sure Kevin raises money and then all of a sudden buys a plan it's like we're going through an SEC audit or an audit that will be reviewed by the SEC but like all of the money is so transparently accessible and Ross Gerber at GK has all of our money almost all of our money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,uh it he's managing it for like a fraction of a fee like I a fraction of a percent at that I think he's probably losing money doing this for us for the relationship that that we're building long term so uh househack is winning on so many levels and now rather than have some miscellaneous employee go look for deals for househack Kevin gets to go look for deals for house hack while operating his other businesses so this is a very very important business decision to make sure that the media business can still succeed while I could still grow the other businesses which I think that house hack business is in the future a multi-billion dollar company which I'm really excited about uh,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sOw_xpfCnxI,and so hey look you know we're going to be launching the non-accredited round for house hack very very soon along with that you'll be getting all of our audited financials the SEC review of our financials you will see Zero expenses in there for Kevin's plane that's because Kevin's plane is a uh a a a an expense of the media business in the future might it make sense to have some commercial equivalent expenses like hey like if we had to fly commercially it would have cost us this much money in tickets and this much for a hotel sure,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

sOw_xpfCnxI,okay so knock on wood that tomorrow also be good but that's why I'm not dressed up like I promised I would be not trying to make excuses but I don't feel very good and this is actually my second time filming this video because I feel that the second time around I'm providing a little bit more of a clear video the last video I was trying to teach a little bit more about tax benefits and I think it you know went over some folks heads and then and then conclusions were drawn that shouldn't have been drawn so thank you very much for watching we'll see in the next one,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
WPxP2heADjQ, don't forget we have the tour coming to you linked below Nandy from our real estate investing course asks i need funding and money to buy a bit of real estate i want to get in but i need money well here's how you're gonna do it whenever you get paid you need to take a portion of that money and then wherever it is you bank that money that you want to save you need to put it somewhere else seriously this sounds really simple but you ought to do it because it wasn't until I did it that I actually started really saving money here's how I did it you know at the time I was making like two hundred dollars a week so I'm like okay I'll save a hundred dollars every single week so what I'll do is I'll transfer that hundred dollars for my chase checking account into my Chase savings account the problem with that was anytime something came up that I wanted to buy like I really would want that new beach cruiser it's 999 and I don't want anybody else to buy it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
WPxP2heADjQ,oh because if somebody else buys it I'm gonna be really pissed so what I what I do is well I got the money of my savings and checking so I'd combine the money and I go spend it and so what do you have to do you literally have to take that savings money and transfer it out to another bank account that you just don't log into the way I do it is I set up a very free totally free it's easy to do just go to the website TD Ameritrade com open account super simple,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
WPxP2heADjQ,and I didn't even invest in anything at first I didn't buy any stocks or anything you could do this with a Bank of America or and allied savings I don't really care what you do and what you're gonna do is you're literally just gonna transfer your savings every single time to that different bank and just Park it there best-case scenario you have this on auto-draft so automatically every single week it's like - 100 - 100 - 100 and now the cool thing that happens is when you're like man I really want that beach cruiser you're like ah but do I really want to go through the hassle of calling TD Ameritrade and authorizing a transfer back to Chase then I have to wait three days and then by the time you get the money you're like I don't want it anymore,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
WPxP2heADjQ,anyways so it like forces this delayed ability to buy so that's the first thing all of us should do and how to get the money look most of us have jobs out there it's not a job problem it's usually a savings problem so get that money set aside the next thing you really need to do,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
WPxP2heADjQ,is you can't act local lenders see if there are down payment assistance programs out there so that you can actually replace paying your landlord and the government grants you the money for your down payment you could usually go to local credit unions or local lenders and they should be educated on a down payment assistance programs for you a lot of states especially like California will actually grant you the money and after a certain amount of time will expect no repayment whatsoever there are excellent programs out there obviously then the next thing you could do is you could just get a job that pays you more money but that's a lot easier said than done one of our most active investing members asked in discord hypothetically could one keep a tenant while doing a kitchen slash bathroom renovation and discounting their rent or is it not worth the hassle don't do it ever never ever dude look here's the thing first things first tenants will complain about everything while you have work going on things got dusty my baby got woken up I had to come back from work because the power got turned off and my wife was pissed because she couldn't do the laundry this that or whatever it doesn't matter you're gonna hear about it non fricken stop and this is not to say there's anything wrong with tenants I'd like there's nothing wrong with being a tenant I just look at it and say if I was a tenant I'd be pissed too,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
WPxP2heADjQ,I don't want that inconvenience in my life even if it means a little bit of a discount in rent the odds are you're not gonna be able to pay me enough to deal with having a contractor remodeling a bathroom a kitchen all the time I think it's a bad idea I think you're better off knocking this stuff out while the tenants not there working around the clock and banging out the project no flip side I'm gonna take this a step further let's say you're about to rent a property that is you have a property that's in escrow or something and let's say you're gonna close escrow it's gonna be yours you're gonna get the keys on April 30th and you're gonna rent the place on May 15th and what do you do you start showing the property to tenants on April 30th you start saying yeah I'm gonna remodel the kitchen I'm gonna redo the bathroom,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
WPxP2heADjQ,and I'm gonna do this this is the worst thing you could do in property management start promising things to tenants because when tenants hear you say remodel kitchen this is what they picture where when you say remodel kitchen this is what you mean so there's really no way to convey this appropriately to tenants don't do it get things done and then rent out the property while the tenants are there collect the rent you really want to do a remodel tell the tenant you're raising their rent $50 if they don't move pocket the $50 and just rub it in your face and go I don't have to do a remodel if they move then you can go to your remodel ok there you go thanks for watching [Music] [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os, what's up you guys it's Graham here so I have to say this is probably one of the most requested topics I have ever consistently got on my channel and it only took me two and a half years to finally make this video so for anyone who's ever commented asking me to make a video on what to do when you turn 18 or how to invest as a teenager here you go your wish is my command we're gonna be going over exactly what you should be doing as a teenager to set yourself up financially exactly what you need to do when you turn 18 years old step-by-step and exactly what you should be doing with your time to make the most out of those early years and this is the type of video I wish I saw when I was 17 or 18 years old because I made a few of these mistakes that I could have entirely avoided just by watching like a 15 minute video like this if this existed when I was 17 or 18 maybe it did I didn't see it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,so anyway now now you're here now you see it and just trust me when I say this no matter what you want to do with your life or how much money you have right now or how much time you have right now if you just watch this video and implement even just a few of the things that I talk about here I guarantee you will be ahead financially so with that said sit back relax,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,and this is what I recommend so here's my first piece of advice as soon as you turn 18 go and get a credit card I want you to skip the presents and the birthday cake because that's not gonna make you money and instead you got to get a credit card and that's gonna be your birthday present to yourself and if you're over the age of 18 and you haven't done this yet that I want you just to watch this step then after this you got to pause the video and literally just go and get a credit card as soon as you can like like now but in all seriousness though if I had any regrets in my teenage years it was by not getting a credit card because I grew up with two parents who were in credit card debt I saw the effects credit cards had on them and I basically grew up with the mentality that credit cards were pointless they were evil and you should always pay with us to debit card or cash you should never use credit,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,so I was pretty much like the teenage version of a Dave Ramsey that was by the way until I wanted to invest in real estate when I was about 21 years old and no bank wanted to give me a loan because I had absolutely zero credit history whatsoever sure was thinking I am so cool for never needing a credit card and staying in a debt until I found out I couldn't get a mortgage because of that and that was a very rude awakening I just didn't understand that building your credit wasn't about being irresponsible with money it wasn't about being in debt it's simply about playing the system to your benefit by showing lenders that you could pay your bills on time and in full and if you could go and do that successfully then lenders will see that you could properly handle money and because of that they're more likely to lend you money to then go and invest with and doing all of this by the way is very easy and if you're just starting out I highly recommend a credit card called the Discover it's secured card all you need to do is go to their website typing your information you're gonna put down a small deposit and it will give you back a credit line equivalent to that deposit so if you put down $200 as a deposit that is going to become your new credit line this credit card is totally free there's no annual fees and you'll get cash back on every purchase so pretty much every purchase you make now is 1 to 2 percent less expensive if you just charge it on the card and all you need to do to build your credit is just spend a minimal amount on the card every month like put $20 in the card every month and then just go and pay it off in full before it's due and just do that consistently it's really just as simple as doing that the entire process is going to take you maybe,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,15 minutes so if you haven't done this already and you're over the age of 18 seriously just trust me on this one pause the video go and do this and come back to it I swear to you guys it is going to help you tremendously in the future if you just start building your credit now now secondly assuming you don't already have one and you're over the age of 18 years old go and open up now your own bank account I think it's incredibly important that you have your own bank account that is solely in your name that only you have access to I think it's just the next logical part of being a financially responsible independent adult,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,and I would say most importantly go and open up a bank account without any ridiculous fees like there shouldn't be any account minimums or any ridiculous monthly maintenance fees or anything like this like like spending forty dollars to order checks I did that I had to spend $40 to order checks and let's just say I was not happy about that so when it comes to this here are a few my own suggestions the first one is an online bank it's a lie bank it's one of my favorite online banks they're completely free there's no fees there's no minimums,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,"Ivan's incredibly happy with them you could very easily open up an account with them online their savings account pays 1.9 percent in interest you can have as many checking accounts as you want they give you free checks free debit card free saving everything's free I highly recommend them now the only downside I could see with a lie Bank is that they're online there's no physical branches that you can go and walk into so I recommend if you want a physical bank you can actually walk into with branches everywhere I use Bank of America and if you're under the age of 25 years old and a student then everything you have with Bank of America is pretty much free they waive all the fees so there's really no downside and you may as well just set up an account with them otherwise if you're over the age of 25 years old and not a student as long as you keep $1,500 in your account they're gonna waive all of the fees so that's the way around it it also is a third option you can look into a local credit union usually these have really great services there's no fees and an overall really good customer service so if you have a good local bank just go down there as soon as you turn 18 years old and open up an account with them and like I said just do me one favor no monthly maintenance fees just make sure your bank account has no fees and I'm good that makes me happy and again this step is really just about learning to manage money on your own by having your own bank account that you are fully responsible for and that is one step closer to being a financially responsible adult and smashing the like button a third as soon as you can once you're over the age of eighteen go and sign up for a Roth IRA again this is another one of those things that I should have done when I was 18 years old but back then I had no idea what a Roth IRA was I had no idea how it worked and how was I supposed to know I should have done this it wasn't until a few years later that I was on Reddit and someone suggested I get one",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,I was like wait a second why have I done this sooner this is this is awesome,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,"I'm gonna go and set one up and if you're not familiar with what a Roth IRA is all it is is a retirement account that lets you contribute what's called post tax money that just means that you've already paid taxes on the money you contribute to that account and then the age of 59 and a half all of the profit that you've made within the Roth IRA is yours to keep completely tax-free now this account is really good to start as a teenager or really as young as you possibly can for two main reasons the first reason is that chances are you're not making a lot of money right now and chances are because of that you're not paying a lot in taxes that's really the perfect time to invest within a Roth IRA because right now you're not losing a lot of money to taxes like you would later in life when you're potentially in a higher tax bracket a second when you're young you also have the power of compound interest this is where your money makes you more money that then makes you more money that makes you more money it's kind of like a snowball rolling down a hill and as it continues rolling it starts getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger that's compound interest like let's just take this example let's just say that you invest $5,000 at the age of 30 at an 8% return that means at the age of 60 that $5,000 will have turned into just over $50,000 but on the other hand if you invested that same $5,000 at the age of 18 instead of at the age of 30 by the time you're 60 that $5,000 will have turned into more than 120 $6,000 that means that just by investing your money a little bit earlier you will have more than doubled your profit by the age of 60 thanks to compound interest so that's why you need to start a Roth IRA as soon as you possibly can preferably as soon as you turn 18 years old I have my Roth IRA set up through Vanguard",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,I also highly recommend fidelity and again it's extremely easy to do it'll take you like 15 minutes and if you haven't done this already all I want you to do is go and pause the video go to one of those websites or just go anywhere just just set one of those up and then come back to the video to watch the rest of it trust me you're not going to regret doing this and forth this one is so important to start as early as you possibly can but honestly it applies to any age out there and that is stay out and stay away from consumer debt and when I say this I'm not referring to like a low interest rate mortgage on a rental property or leveraging your money to make you even more money I'm talking about like high interest rate credit card debt a high interest rate personal loan high interest like auto loan or any other consumer type of debt that has really no purpose to make you more money of then just to make your life awful I really believe for anything other than a business real estate or investment if you cannot afford to buy something outright then don't buy it and don't finance it it's so important to stay out of debt like this and get in the habit of never buying things you can't afford outright and less like I said a business investment or real estate instead the responsible way to handle purchases like this is to only buy things that you could afford to pay off in full but instead you put it on a credit card so you get the points,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,and then you pay off the credit card in full by the time it's due that way you stay out of debt and at the same time you can continue building up your credit history,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,so it's a win-win debt is really one of those things where if used incorrectly can absolutely destroy your life especially at a young age where you should really be prioritizing saving and investing having any sort of debt weighing you down like this could absolutely ruin everything so just get in the habit when you're young to only buy things that you could afford and if you put them on a credit card just make sure the credit card is always paid off in full by the time it's do now 5th if you're a teenager watching this right now going get a job yes seriously though go and get a job I know I sound like an old man saying this I sound like this type of person's like did my god but seriously go and get a job if there's anything that set me on a successful path and got me on the right track to things it was this I got my first job right before high school at a Marine Aquarium warehouse where I would go in and take pictures of the livestock that would come in my parents would go and drive me after school from like,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,4:00 to 6:00 p.m. so I can go and work for a bit and the owner Chris in the very beginning would go and pay me in like three fish and coral and I had an absolute blast like if there's any like I would rather go and work after school for a few hours and I would hang out with my friends I mean that is how much fun I had doing this and when I was going and doing this to the manager and he really did his best to like take me under his wing and like teach me the ropes even if it's something as small as just preparing shipping boxes I didn't care I just I wanted to be busy and I wanted to do anything I could to learn anything,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,and then actually in high school I started working a little bit more and actually getting paid for some of the work I was doing it not just like getting free stuff being able to work like this taught me everything I was around like actual working adults all day long I got to see how the business was run I got to see the importance of customer service and I got to see what it was like to actually make and save my own money having that type of experience was absolutely invaluable and I really believe it was that that just helped shape my entire future going forward so if you're a teenager right now and you're watching this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,and you don't have a job don't get a job take any job you can even if it's just working a few hours a week I don't care work the experience that you get from doing this now will be worth it a thousand times over by the time you're older plus if you could go and make some extra money it's always worth it just to make some extra money who doesn't want extra money and honestly there's no way I would be here today if it wasn't for those experiences that I got by working part time when I was younger now six for all of you young whippersnappers out there just get used to living below your means from all the mistakes I could have made when I was younger this is one of the ones that I have practiced religiously and it has paid off one thousand times over no matter how much money I ever made I always lived like I made significantly less even when I was working part time throughout high school I pretty much saved all the money that I made even though I had no idea what I was doing with investing I still managed to accumulate about six thousand dollars by the time I graduated high school and it was with that amount of money that I used to fund my real estate license and get everything set up for that business and then even as a real estate agent I pretty much saved all of my money and that allowed me to go and invest in real estate at the very bottom of the market and even now despite how much money I'm making from real estate and also from YouTube I saved like 99.999 seven percent of my income and you know I'm sure that is going to pay off in the future for whatever opportunities arise coming up and all of that happened because of this one thing and that was just living below your means just don't go and buy stupid to impress people who don't matter don't go and buy things that are not going to make a positive long-term difference in your life,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,I such a firm believer that it's totally acceptable to live extremely cheaply in your 20s just for the sake of setting yourself up financially for the rest of your life I really believe that this time right now is the time that you could get wildly ahead by saving your money as early as possible and in the future while all of your friends are working jobs they hate because they went out blew their money and partied every weekend you're gonna be sitting there with more money than you know what to do with traveling the world making YouTube videos in your garage and telling other teenagers how to save money now 7th I really believe it's so important not to go to college just for the sake of going to college maybe I'm out of line here but I really believe that this is an epidemic that needs to be stopped and one day people are gonna wake up and realize that they don't need a college degree to do what they want to do so here's the thing now for those that don't realize I never went to college,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,so I am a little bit biased when I speak of this but I have seen so many my friends go to college because their parents pressured them into going so they go to school and they waste 4 years of their life studying something that they didn't really care about and then they get bogged down with student loans,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,"and then they graduate and then they can't find a job and they have to find a way to repay $30,000 in debt so given that here's my solution to all of this if you don't know what you want to do with your life either get some work experience until you can figure it out or instead just go to a two-year Community College just to get your general education requirements out of the way until you figure it out that way you could save a ton of time you can save a ton of money you can get some work experience at the same time and make some money until eventually you figure out what you want to do and then from there you can make a decision but to be fair on the other hand if you have a clear-cut path to what you want to do and college is a requirement to doing it then by all means go to college we're also if your parents are paying for you to go to college and you can graduate without any student loan debt whatsoever then by all means go for it",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,but if you're going to be paying for school out of pocket and you don't know exactly what you want to do and this is going to cost you 4 years of your time and your life that you could just be spent working then definitely think very long and hard if college is the right choice for you at that moment like I'm not any economist here I'm just someone who loves personal finance,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,but I think we could avoid a lot of wasteful student loan debt if more people just took a year or two off after high school just to gain some work experience and really try to figure out what they want to do with their life it's so much better just to wait and really decide what you want to do then jumping into college right after high school because that's what everyone else is doing it makes no sense to me and finally eight in terms of how to invest as a teenager this is pretty much all you need to know for most people out there all you need to do is invest in a low-cost broad index fund invest in that consistently and then invest with the expectation of holding it for the next 30 to 40 years that is literally all you need to do this could be Fidelity's fund I will throw it up on the screen here it could be a vanguard funds like VT Sachs or V fiix or even a target date Vanguard retirement fund which I will put right here too and if you just do that one investment chances are that is going to be your full retirement by the time you're older and it's just that on the other hand if you're not gonna be doing this and you want to take more risk with your money now when you're young is the time to do it like if you want to go and start a business now is the time to do it if you want to go and gamble on cryptocurrency then now when you're young is the time to do it and if you lose money it's something like this then at the very least you got it out of the way early on and if you're successful with it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,then hey you know what you set yourself up financially and maybe you're a little bit further ahead either way I think you win like it's a lot better to lose a small amount of money at 18 years old than a large amount of money when you're 40 years old so any learning experiences like this just get them out of the way early on same with starting a business like if you go and start a business and it fails at 18 years old then it's no big deal versus if you start a business at 40 years old and fail then there tend to be a lot more repercussions from that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EKIhc3tS0os,so you want you have my full permission just if you have any ideas or any risky investments you want to start a business just go and run with it now is your time just to take those risks and to get those learning experiences out of the way and just kind of figure it out on your own and that's ladies and gentlemen is all of my advice for anyone who wants to know what to do when they turn 18 or anything that they could do as a teenager to set themselves up finance I just trust me when I say this but I have learned all of these through trial and error and you could avoid all my mistakes just by implementing these things that I have just messed up on or not figured out sooner so please promise me that my mistakes are not made in vain please learn from them so that that way my mistakes are at least made with a good purpose behind them and you can learn from them like all of this advice is totally free,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

QLtvIXc6PWQ, what's up you guys it's graham here so i would like to think of myself as being social media savvy you know i got a youtube channel i got an instagram account that i post on every now and then i even have a facebook group that i browse every single day but there's one thing that i cannot seem to wrap my mind around and that's tick tock and straight up anytime i spend more than a few minutes on this app it just makes me realize that i am getting old i just recently turned 30 and already i'm starting to feel like the old man just sitting in front of this house on the porch yelling at all the kids to get off his lawn but anyway tiktok is slowly evolving from comedy clips and bad acting to a place where entrepreneurs can share their business advice and teach everyone else how to be wealthy all in the span of 30 seconds so with that i'm going to be pushing myself out of my comfort zone for a little bit i'm going to try to do what all the cool kids are doing,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,and i'm going to be sorting through all of the business and entrepreneurial tick tocks i'll review them and tell you whether or not they're legitimate or the cringiest thing in the entire world i'm going to be doing all of this before it gets banned here in the united states for violating privacy protection laws so with that said if you wouldn't mind just ticking the like button for the youtube algorithm it'll be greatly appreciated you can also you can also talk it too i have no idea if that worked maybe we just go back to smashing the like button for the youtube algorithm like the good old days thank you so much and let's begin looking at some tick tocks here i have them up on my computer,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,so we're going to be starting off with this one by ryan and this is a really easy one to start off with because it doesn't have any annoying background music these are my neighbors over here these are two million dollar homes [Music] and then you have my house which is across the street when you're looking at buying real estate buy the smallest house in the best area i have no complaints about being the smallest house in the neighborhood those guys properties are going to push my value up first of all those don't look like houses those are office buildings just kidding it's actually pretty decent advice and any time you invest in real estate you never want to be an outlier for the area typically you'll get better resale and rental value by being one of the smaller homes just surrounded by a lot of more expensive homes so this is true the only case where i think this would be a bad idea is if there's a zombie apocalypse and all of a sudden he is the easiest target because he's just outside of those gates but really though if we look at those gates like those look like really flimsy gates who are they trying to keep out of with this at that height what's the point but overall you know what i agree with them,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,and it's pretty good advice although it's still quite the comment to say that he is the smallest house in the area while still having a two-car garage what looks like to be about 3 000 square feet and a pool i think it's really more like having the smallest mansion in the area and now we got another one what they don't teach you in college how to make ten to twenty thousand dollars a month oh man i wish that would actually be a class though just how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year one-on-one spend the whole semester just learning practical skills that will actually make you money like how to negotiate your salary how to network with other people which careers are most in demand should you do the 401k matching what to say to your employer when should go off and start a business how much money should you have saved up should you live with your parents until you're 45 years old just like real honest real world stuff that's what we need to know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,but no we get to learn that here on tick tock instead so let's give this one a shot and see what this is all about here's something else they don't teach you in college it's how to make 10 to 20k a month without any cash credit or a degree so you want to drive around your city looking for rundown houses okay once you found one take down the property address here's another one look at this one crack foundation i love how the caption is there is so much money out there that's literally someone's house you're filming if you didn't know the context behind this it looks like he's just casing places to rob,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,like oh look at that one there's so much money in there then you go home you go into the site called truepeoplesearch.com punching the address hit search and it will skip trace and find the property owner phone number for you then you call the seller up make an offer to buy their property using this formula now first we got this term here arv which is called after repair value which is what the home is worth in perfect condition once you fix it up and then you subtract 30 percent off of that then we're going to be subtracting the cost to repair the property and then we're going to be subtracting your fee from that too then we may as well just subtract your soul while we're at it and what's left over is how much money you offer the seller so here's a quick example of how this would work let's say you find a property that would be worth four hundred thousand dollars fully fixed up we're going to immediately go and subtract 30 percent off that so now that's going to leave us with 280 000,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,but it's gonna take us a hundred thousand dollars in repairs so now we're gonna knock that off as well and then of course you need a ten thousand dollar fee for finding it and that means we're going to be offering these sellers one hundred and seventy thousand dollars for their home that would be worth four hundred thousand dollars fully fixed up this to me seems more like a how to insult a homeowner with a really low offer tutorial would you consider 120 000 for your property all cash and we can close on the date of your choice no why would i consider that my home is worth five hundred thousand dollars where did you get my number seriously i get calls like this every now and then and it's a joke like i know what they're doing i know what my home is worth and i'm not going to take a 50 discount on it just so you could go and pitch it to a real buyer once i sell accept my offer i'm gonna go to this website here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,and i'm going to send them a purchase and sell contract for them to sign then you go on craigslist put in we buy houses and look all these investors going to pop up you're going to call them up and see if they're willing to buy the property over from you for 10 to 20 000 or more than what you got on the contract for that my friend is called wholesaling and that's how you make your money but then it says 100 legit if done correctly i would question anything if they have to use the words 100 legit now as far as the legality of this is concerned in california it's a bit of a gray area it's totally okay to use your own money to go and buy real estate without needing any real estate license,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,but if you go and advertise or solicit that house to somebody else then that's not allowed without a real estate license and that's a bit iffy you're also going to need to establish proof that you had the intention and means to purchase the property yourself not that you just drove around an area got a home under contract and then pitched it to some random people on craigslist if this is done honestly and ethically then i don't have any problems with it as long as it follows the law but i will say this even though you can make money wholesaling real estate i rarely ever see someone successful long-term wholesaling real estate and most people who i see making money wholesaling real estate are just teaching other people how to wholesale real estate so i'm gonna go ahead and rate this one a four out of ten it's really good that he's getting people thinking of ways to make money but practically and logistically this is a very difficult one to do okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,so next we got another person that i reviewed a while ago her name is addison and she is one of the larger entrepreneur influencers on tick tock and if i remember correctly most of her content was her dancing with the text i became a millionaire at 25 and then she just asked you to follow her to figure out how she actually did it but she never actually tells you how she did it it's more of her dancing to her becoming a millionaire 25. but let's see how this new one compares and whether or not it's good advice by the way i can't play any of the music in the background because i don't want to get any copyright claims but yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,it's actually way more fun to watch this without any music or any context of what she's dancing to so after watching this it seems like these are good statistics the only thing i found surprising was that she says it takes you until you're 32 years old on average to become a millionaire i think maybe she meant to say that it takes you 32 years of working and saving on average to become a millionaire because really there's no way the average millionaire became a millionaire at 32 years old for that to be an average half of millionaires would have to become a millionaire earlier than that so of course i had to do my own research on this and according to fidelity and the new york times the average age where people cross the one million dollar net worth mark is in their late 50s and even the book the millionaire next door says the average age of millionaires is 62 years old,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,so i just got to say right there her saying 32 years old is just it's got to be very false now don't get me wrong that certainly doesn't mean you cannot be a millionaire in your 20s or 30s after all if you were a millionaire by 25 i'm sure you would be dancing on tick tock too but it's certainly not common and it's not easy and a lot of people take much longer than that to achieve we could just do the math here if you want to be a millionaire at 32 years old and you start working at 22 years old without any student loan debt you would need to invest an average of 65 000 a year after taxes in order to achieve that goal that realistically means you need an average income of 140 000 a year beginning at the age of 22 while also living frugally for that entire decade or really who am i kidding you could do that with 15 000 in a few months with tesla call options on robinhood,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,but if you're gonna go with the traditional save money and investing at root it's gonna take you a while to get there and you're gonna need some pretty well-performing investments besides that though it's not bad advice and i see what she's going for with this as she mentions here almost 10 of the population is a millionaire so it's not as elusive as what many people think so i'm gonna go ahead and rate this one a six out of ten because it's not bad advice but i do question that 32 year old statistic and next we got this one how to buy a rolls royce we're at countless jobs from the age of 15 all the way up to 24.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,i had to learn how to be a lone wolf by separating myself from friends and family members to be able to get to where i'm at today at the age of 24 years old i decided to start my own business i worked about 18 hours a day for a year straight to be able to get him i wanted to make sure that i had millions of dollars in the bank account before i treat myself to almost 100 car to this day i surround myself with only about five people around my circle that are on the same mission as me success can be very lonely at the top that's why a bus has 50 seats and a rolls-royce has four yeah you know by that logic imagine how wealthy you would be if you bought a bicycle that only has one seat just kidding but,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,yeah it doesn't really tell us how we actually went and bought a rolls-royce all we know is that he was lonely he has only five friends which is more people than i end up seeing in a given month and he worked about 18 hours a day for a year and then of course a rolls-royce just magically appears with really dramatic music behind it from all of this so i just got to say i respect the fact that he waited until he had 50 times the amount of money it would take to go and splurge on a car like this i think it's really important that people don't just make money and then the first thing they do is go and buy a fancy exotic car there's nothing wrong with wanting those things but by the time you get them ideally you want that to be such a small percentage of your overall net worth that you don't even notice the money has gone so i agree with that but everything else didn't really tell us what he did to afford a rolls royce,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,i really just want to see a full income breakdown from him like how much money does he make from amazon fba how much money does he make from teaching people how to make money on amazon fba how much money does he make from his investment i want to see everything i want to see a breakdown of how much money this guy is making that would be a lot more valuable than i think this is so i'm going to go ahead and give this one a 5 out of 10 because it's not bad advice but it doesn't exactly tell us anything about how he was able to afford a rolls royce besides having five friends and working 18 hours a day and feeling lonely so now we got another one here five habits that will make you become a millionaire first of all what's up with all these guys in rolls royces i think this is now replaced with the lamborghini used to be a few years ago for anyone who is teaching how to make money online okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,so here's what we got we got working out meditation at your office table study the bur method okay put all that money in real estate read and then follow him now one thing i find kind of suspicious here is that throughout this entire thing he's wearing the exact same outfit i think that's the secret to becoming a millionaire you just want to wear the same thing after your workout in the morning just keep that on all day long look at steve jobs he wore the same thing every single day that's why he was so rich i also see a lot of these habits to become a millionaire include reading and i gotta say i did my fair share of reading back in the day the four hour work week think and grow rich awaken the giant within how to win friends and influence people all of those were phenomenal books those books are really a good platform to build on but then after a while you want to just go and make it happen but i will say we gotta rate this one,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,and i'm gonna give it a six out of ten none of this is really bad advice and honestly i think it could benefit most people who end up following it but then i came across this guy he is giving you completely unsolicited stock market investing advice that is one day going to make you rich all right everyone knows this guy right richard branson virgin airlines version coastal whatever,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,yeah so 4.1 billion check that out networth multibillionaire virgin whatever who knows but online it says he's worth 4 billion so that seems seems kind of legit to me this man started virgin galactic great company guy loves space you know he's in into space race all that stuff check this out check this out man you see that this is your chart how's it been on the market long like it says he's into space and all that stuff like galaxies and stars and and jets and air airplanes and and and sci-fi seems like a good company to invest in there's its peak right there you can see that it's at about 15 bucks right now i say it's a buy give it two months three months maybe even less easy cash out,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,okay seriously though by this logic we have a billionaire who's into space that's money except when you actually go and look how virgin galactic stock has performed since he posted this video about 30 days ago it's actually up 25 this guy kind of reminds me of the robin hood due diligence where you take the most obscure things possible and you try to twist it into some narrative and it ends up actually being really good advice and ends up working no joke though i actually like this guy the most from everyone i have seen on tiktok he just it's he seems himself he's honest there's no ulterior motive here there's no hidden agenda it's just him giving his own thoughts on different stocks and why he's excited about it and he is himself so for that i honestly have to give this a 9 out of 10 because it's he's not pitching anything to you he doesn't make any money on whether or not you buy virgin galactic stock let's be real here he's doing it because he's having fun doing it and that i honestly believe is the most important from all of this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,so this guy 9 out of 10. and then we got this one right here it looks like it's gonna be right out of an episode of scared straight where he's gonna talk to you into staying out of trouble and not going back to juvie but let's give it a shot go to this website type this into the search bar scroll down to this post for example we're gonna pick this one check out the guidelines but we're not gonna be the ones writing the article go to upwork.com search for a copywriter with these filters we're gonna pay someone between three and six dollars to write this article for us here's an example of people that i found send them the guidelines and have them write the post submit the article make your money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,okay that actually seems like really interesting advice but my first thought was why don't the people in the philippines just cut you out and go directly to them and make all the money so i went and checked this out myself i went on the same website i even clicked on the same article that he clicked on now first of all this is a magazine that reaches 3.8 million readers every single month no way is a magazine like this just letting random people out there outsource the work and then paying them for the full amount it says they require you to submit previous articles that you've written for consideration and then they want a writer with anecdotes and a strong narrative flow who writes with a sense of humor i guarantee you are not getting that for three dollars or even 10 dollars an hour they also say feature should be queried about six months in advance you will receive a written response within six weeks,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,so this is not you just going and paying someone three dollars an hour in the philippines so you could submit it to a magazine that has 3.8 million monthly readers and then you get paid the full amount for doing absolutely no work whatsoever if it were really that easy why is the magazine just not going and doing this themselves so i have to say i give this one a 2 out of 10 if it actually works because like 99 of all of these how to make money online in minutes for typing and like doing all this crap or watching videos online or whatever they promote none of it really works okay so that's our episode of watching tick tock business and financial advice for the day and i gotta say it was mostly pretty bad advice but at least it gets people thinking about becoming an entrepreneur or finding creative ways to make money online like i remember reading the four hour work week when i was about 17 years old and just thinking to myself wow i could make 60 thousand dollars a month being able to sell a weight loss pill online,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,and i could just outsource all of the work somewhere else and i'll just sit back and collect money and work like two hours a day i mean obviously that never happened but it did get me thinking of different ways to make money down the line and it was inspirational,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QLtvIXc6PWQ,so i really think at its core at the end of the day that's what this is all really about this is not so much about the day-to-day intricacies and practicalities of making money but instead sometimes when you're young all you care about are fancy cool cars and really easy ways to make money without going to school and even though they rarely ever work out it at least gets you pointed in the right direction and thinking the right way about how you can make money and how you could smash the like button for the youtube algorithm and get your two free stocks down below in the description by depositing 100 on a weeble with one of the stocks valued all the way up to 1 400 so with that said you guys thank you so much for watching i really appreciate it as always make sure to destroy the subscribe button and the notification bell also feel free to add me on instagram i post it pretty much daily,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

BougQAMldsM, I mean we've all seen this new wave of artificial intelligence that's taking over pretty much everything it's like a company can just throw the word AI into their marketing materials and everyone eats it up because AI is the future and it's revolutionary but even though it's recently turned into another generic SEO keyword maybe there's actually something to this or perhaps someone is actually crazy enough to put their money where their mouth is after all Chachi Boutique it apparently picks stocks better than your fund manager it's supposedly surprisingly accurate in predicting stock moves so with real life people being absolutely awful at picking stocks this could be the solution that we've all been waiting for introducing the chat gbt fund okay before you get too confused let's back up for a second chat gbt is a computer program that allows you to ask it almost anything,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,and it'll spit back an answer using its artificial intelligence think of it like a robotic definitely not sentient being whose entire objective is to scour a database of information find precisely what you're looking for and give you a written response within a matter of seconds well evidently this was so popular that it got 1 million users in the first five days of launching it created a worldwide race of tech Giants to embrace the new technology or be left behind by Skynet and every other YouTuber including myself made videos on potential ways that you could profit from it except this was really only the tip of the iceberg see as sophisticated as the original Chachi BT was it was only programmed up until the year 2021 meaning anything newer than that wasn't able to be taken into consideration so on March 14th,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,chat gbt4 was released which is pretty much like comparing the size of Earth to the size of the sun except here that basically means that Chachi bt4 is a lot smarter than all of us there's even full articles dedicated to itemizing every single difficult test that chat gbts passed like acing the SAT AP exam sommelier tests for medical exams and even the State Bar on the first try so why not apply this to investing again introducing the chat gbt fund all of this began with an article from CNN claiming that Chachi BT could pick stocks better than your fund manager and since it been rather disappointed with Jim Cramer's track record I thought it would be worth the read as the article explained between March 6 and April 28th a dummy portfolio of 38 stocks gained 4.9 percent while 10 leading investment funds clocked an average loss of 0.8 percent now don't get the wrong idea it's not like you could just ask chat gbt,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,to help make back your losses for listening to basement dwelling dgns on Wall Street bets who had no idea what they were talking about Instead This researcher asked it to create a portfolio of stocks from high quality businesses with criteria taken from the leading 10 funds it's competing against this included low levels of debt sustained growth and assets that would generate a competitive advantage and wouldn't you know it nine weeks later this fund is still going strong outperforming the overall Market by five percent and creating a sensation of people who took this and now want to create their own portfolio from making a whole bunch of money however I do want to mention that In fairness fund managers aren't exactly the creme de La Creme to be competing against like not to be a party pooper here but it's been shown that throwing random darts blindfolded outperforms hedge funds fish beat the market by 14 and a half percent over three years a cat outperformed by eight percent and even a crypto trading hamster made a higher return than Warren Buffett oh and not to mention Fidelity did a survey on their most successful investors,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,and they turned out to be a whole bunch of dead people anyway in all seriousness it's one thing to be right in the short term and it's another thing to be right consistently long term and so far nine weeks just isn't long enough to claim victory over Steve from accounting so A new challenge was born introducing the chat gbt fund again with this challenge chat gbt is given a simple prompt we are giving you a fifty thousand dollar investment account to point you to the test every Monday you will analyze and buy a new set of stocks and we will sell two weeks later you will repeat this on a weekly basis you win and as you know it's AI is in but,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,but how exactly does this selection process work well this entire concept is based on a research paper that successfully used chat gbt to analyze which headlines were positive negative or neutral for stock prices their chat EBT recorded which headlines yielded the largest movements after being published Based On A String of keywords and what it found was that it was actually pretty good at predicting which stock prices were going to fall the most basically this chat gbt program found that negative articles yielded the largest immediate downward move in prices and when you concentrated that among smaller stocks you had the most upside if you shorted them or basically vetted against them now before you think that chat gbt could be the next coming of Warren Buffett keep in mind that once you begin looking into the details you'll realize the chat gbt was given six parameters to beat the market three of them lost money will the best increased by 500 percent so if you followed all of them you'd pretty much be even as of now try gbt simply taking in information determining whether or not that information is positive or negative relaying that against movements in the past and then making its best guess as to what might happen in the future for instance just recently chat gbt recommended Uber over Lyft based on the sentiment of recent news articles and even though basing your entire investment philosophy often news is well stupid you do have to admit it's pretty intriguing of course by now you're probably thinking to yourself but Grant how do they analyze real-time information when chat GPT isn't able to do that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,well I'm gonna have this guy answer it because he's a lot smarter than I am and yes his books are categorized by Heights let's take a look so the way you get around that problem is by fitting in the information that you wanted to consider the relevant macroeconomic information interest rates employment instead of the global economy basically whatever you think it's important in order to make a good decision separate from that though it's also shown that this challenge jailbreaks chat gbt to include news articles breaking information and individual stocks and so so many people trust it that it now has over two million dollars of capital following along so what did it end up buying well the first purchase occurred on Monday May 15th and with that it purchased 20 stocks including the likes of Berkshire Hathaway Google Amazon apple and a variety of others and on the first day it was already beating the S&P500.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,keep in mind even though it's too early to tell how this is going to play out it's not the first time that AI has tried to overtake traditional investing and a recent one is called portfolio pilot with this users could copy and paste their portfolios into the tool for analysis receive investment recommendations search for Market information and ask the bot questions all for free of course if you're about to comment but Graham who on Earth would trust this thing well the answer is wealthy people in fact 77 percent of them reported that they've utilized it for stock picks or the way I see it they have the disposable income to try it out for all of our Amusement in addition to that you also have the investment AI magnify which uses computer programs to provide personalized data-driven investment advice while democratizing intelligence in a personalized way essentially the publisher on CNBC tried it out and found it to be an effective way of answering questions giving specific advice and recommending companies depending on what you ask it but the difficult part is I see it is whether or not these companies would be liable for giving personalized investment advice in the event that one of their recommendations ends up losing money after all when you usually ask chat gbt about investing it emphasizes that when you build a portfolio you should incorporate your investment objectives time frame and risk tolerance and for personalized investment advice to a specific individual this is really the correct answer the fact is every situation is different what works for me might not be best for you some people want to take a whole bunch of risk while other people don't want the chance of losing any money you also have to consider that for most people investing is rarely ever logical instead as hard as it might be to want to admit investing is largely based on emotion this is nicely why dead people often make the best investors they don't panic sell when their stock gets a low they don't fomo into something when everyone else is jumping in they simply buy something and stick with it long term until eventually they die and end up in a survey on top of that I could also see issues with chat gbt recommending stocks that do well because it recommended them and people blindly Buy in this reminds me of What's called the Jim Cramer effect where stocks tend to go up after he mentions them doesn't mean that he knew that they were going to be going up in price and that he's a genius investor,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,no but it does mean that his picks were able to generate enough attention for people to buy in causing the price to go up and thereby creating a self-fulfilling prophecy at the end of the day chat gbt is looking for patterns based on past performance and with enough data at its disposal it should in theory be able to form an opinion on what's likely to happen based on prior movements,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,but if everyone gets those recommendations then whatever it recommends would be going up because everyone else is relying on the exact same information causing it to happen because it said it was going to happen but aside from that then let's assume that there are patterns available out there that can be taken advantage of in that case the efficient market hypothesis could kick in which states that when new information comes into the market it's immediately reflected in the Stock's prices and thus cannot generate excess returns so if everybody all of a sudden gets access to the exact same information it no longer works and there's no longer an advantage it's really important to realize that when it comes to investing your chances of making money are directly weighed down by your chances of also losing it and if there's ever a software that tries to exploit that eventually it's no longer going to work personally I tend to believe that investing should be as dumb as possible yes you could get all fancy with asset allocations based on age risk tolerance investment preferences and appetite for the unusual but for most people Warren Buffett recommends something as simple as an S&P500 Index Fund and that's it it's boring plain unsexy and basic but so far it's worked for those who have held long term,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,and I have a feeling most people should probably look into something like that it also worries me that AI doesn't quite account for intuition reason and emotion it's the human factor that makes investing what it is there's always somebody who will believe that they could outsmart the system by finding inefficiencies that no one else sees and certainly some of them do end up doing exactly that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
BougQAMldsM,but I highly doubt that something like Chad CBT would be able to replicate those exact same strategies long term and actually hold people accountable to follow them on the other hand I do believe that chat gbt would be incredibly useful for simplifying information and making it much more digestible for the average investor who doesn't have the time to read earnings reports charts and graphs from that perspective I am all for chat gbt taking over the world but as far as recommending stocks I just don't think it has what it takes unless it becomes self-fulfilling where it recommends everybody the same stocks and they cause it to go up in price because it's what it recommends so if you want to be kept up to date and see what happens with chat gbt's picks and if it actually can beat the market make sure to subscribe because it will be posting updates on this on a regular basis so with that said you guys thank you so much as always hit the like button don't forget to add me on Instagram or Snapchat and finally since we're on the topic of stocks you could get a free stock worth all the way up to a thousand dollars when you sign up with our sponsor public.com Down Below in the description with the code grand when you make a deposit enjoy thank you so much and until next time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

7C6roAxktuI,so here's the deal it was recently found that real wages have barely budged in decades more than half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and the poorest 70 of U.S households don't even have a savings account however there is some good news because the survey reported that Americans would need 500 000 to feel financially secure and a million dollars to retire so in this video we're going to be talking about how to do exactly that starting from nothing in 10 years I know that sounds extremely far-fetched but it's entirely possible and these are my own recommendations from personal experience that I've learned firsthand because there are some step-by-step rules that anyone can follow that work incredibly well that don't cost you a single penny if you have the goal of calling yourself a millionaire exactly 10 years from today although really quick if you enjoy topics like this it would help me out tremendously if you hit the like button or subscribe if you haven't done that already doing that gives me a really good indication of whether or not I should make more videos like this in the future so let me know thank you so much for watching and now let's begin to start before we go into the steps that you could take I'm first going to tell you how I was able to build a million dollar net worth by the age of 26 years old without coming from a wealthy family without any inheritance and without posting a single YouTube video on how to get rich because despite me now making a lot of money talking on YouTube about how to make a lot of money that's not how it initially started but first for Ryan to making money came when I was about 16 years old working a part-time job throughout high school at the time I was paid one dollar for every picture I took in Photoshop that a marine aquarium wholesaler so instead of being paid for my time I was paid on results on a really good day if I was focused I'd be able to make anywhere from 80 to 120 dollars for about five to eight hours worth of work and I loved it now I don't usually recommend that other teenagers follow this advice but I would usually skip school work weekends and take every holiday as an opportunity to earn even more and by the time I was 18 years old I had about five thousand dollars saved up now from there I decided not to pursue college and instead use some of those savings to get licensed as a real estate agent so I could do that full-time even though I didn't know know anyone in the industry and I hadn't the slightest clue what I was doing I would spend every weekend going to open houses and asking other agents how they were able to grow their business by pure luck I met an agent who allowed me to work underneath them help them out with whatever he needed and whatever business I brought in would be split 50 50.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
7C6roAxktuI,from that point on I spent the next four years working 10 to 12 hour days seven days a week taking on any business I could and saving as much money as I earned since I was entirely paid on commission my income was extremely inconsistent so I took saving and personal finance extremely seriously I budgeted every penny that went into and out of my account I wouldn't spend money unless I absolutely had to and I treated every dollar as though it was the last dollar that I would earn but it paid off within four years I had about two hundred thousand dollars saved up from a combination of a growing clientele a few very fortunate listings and the frugality to resist the urge to spend it it was around this time that I noticed my wealthiest clients had begun to invest in real estate and after I helped one of them buy a property in San Bernardino it hit me I should be doing this too,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
7C6roAxktuI,so I spent months seeing potential properties every single weekend and writing lowball offers on every single home that came in the Market within a certain criteria but in doing so I was able to purchase three bank owned properties that I subsequently renovated and then rented out from there I continued reinvesting as much as I could I slowly began to increase my business as a real estate agent I took on higher priced listings my past clients began referring me even more business and all of a sudden I began making a lot more money that allowed me to purchase a fourth property in West Los Angeles around my 26th birthday which I then fixed up and later rented out at that point between the increased Equity of four properties along with cash in the bank I had reached a million dollar net worth by the age of 26 years old starting with zero in ten years before even making a YouTube video about it but in terms of the Practical steps that you could take along with the blueprints that everyone else is able to follow here's what I recommend number one if you're going to do this in 10 years you need to save as much money as possible as simple as it might be to say without this part the entire plan fails and when it comes to building up your net worth at the end of the day it doesn't matter how much money you make but instead how much of it you actually get to keep I can't even begin to tell you how many people I've seen making five hundred thousand dollars a year and spending four hundred and eighty thousand dollars of it on random expenses that make no difference whatsoever as proof of this just consider that twenty percent of people making more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year spend fifteen percent above what they deposit in their accounts and others aren't even able to save any money on five hundred thousand dollars a year so if you wanna know the secret about how I was able to become a millionaire in my twenties it was because I lived as though I was broke and spent as though I was making the bare minimum even today I buy used cars that don't depreciate in value I only spend the money that my investments make I don't buy designer clothes and I subscribed if you haven't done that already now of course I understand that I'm extreme when it comes to finances,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
7C6roAxktuI,and it's not for everybody,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
7C6roAxktuI,but I have to say from my experience most really successful people don't have an income problem they have a spending problem and by cutting back on what is not absolutely necessary you'll be putting yourself that much closer to reaching a million dollars the second if you're going to do this in 10 years you also have to make a lot of money from my experience if you want to speed up the process a lot pick a career that's not dependent on how many hours you work even if you ignore the rest of the video and only focus on one thing Let It Be this because it's so important anytime you work a career that pays you based on a certain amount of hours most likely you'll Plateau rather quickly before hitting a ceiling but as soon as you begin working in a career that pays you based on results or tasks your income could Skyrocket because the number of hours don't make a difference for me I did this by working as a real estate agent because it didn't matter if I worked two hours or 200 hours if the house didn't sell I wasn't getting paid so it was really up to me to utilize my time efficiently and create a schedule that maximized how much money I was able to make personally I think sales are one of the most underrated careers out there because it often serves as a stepping stone to making more money while teaching you everything you need to know about customer service time management and efficiency now of course if you're not the type who wants to get into sales,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
7C6roAxktuI,but you still want something stable while being able to earn more money just consider this it was found that employees who switch jobs every two to three years make twice as much as the person who stays within the same company so consider switching careers leveraging your skills or learning something new to earn more money especially now while many businesses are experiencing a shortage of talent and willing to pay anything possible to find the right person although overall I will say that most people that you hear about who are able to make a lot of money relatively quickly do so by starting a business they saw an unfulfilled Niche and created a solution to a problem or they saw an existing business and figured out a way to do it better obviously this is a huge risk and a big time commitment but if you find an industry that scales quickly you can make a huge amount of money and finally before we go into the Practical step-by-step blueprint number three realistically you're also going to have to invest your money the fact is even though I kept my expenses extremely low and scaled my income throughout my early 20s I would not have become a millionaire by 26 if I didn't invest as an example just consider this if you want to save your way to a million dollars in 10 years you're gonna have to put away 273 dollars a day or 8 333 dollars a month to make that a reality,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
7C6roAxktuI,but if you invest your money instead you could get there with only 158 dollars a day or forty seven hundred and fifty dollars a month averaging an eight percent return although at the same time I get it even though it's nice to think about how simple this would be in a hypothetical scenario investing forty seven hundred and fifty dollars a month is easier said than done this requires that you keep fifty seven thousand dollars a year after taxes and not including your own cost of living like housing car payments Insurance everything else it adds up plus if you're able to actually save fifty seven thousand dollars a year after taxes chances are you're already making between 100 and 120 000 a year while also being excessively Frugal at the exact same time of course some people might say but Graham I'm able to make a 15 return on my money and do that on much less and my buddy makes 30 a month on his crypto Investments so this is false and yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
7C6roAxktuI,I'll admits you could take a different approach to your Investments that might make you a lot more money but there's a catch either you make a return that's directly proportional to your chances of losing money or it's an investment that's going to take a lot more work than you initially expected there's no such thing as a free lunch for me I enjoy the long-term consistency of investing in the stock market through a well-diversified Index Fund because it's really hard to mess that up and 99 of people could get started in less than five minutes but anyway in terms of the Practical steps that anyone could Implement immediately here's what I would do first cut back as many expenses as you possibly can figure out the bare minimum that you need to survive along with some discretionary income thrown in every now and then and from that point on everything you make will be automatically invested second determine how you can make more money perhaps look into switching careers learning a trade taking on a side hustle or starting on a part-time home business the fact is it's not going to be possible if you're earning under fifty thousand dollars a year but the good news is that there are plenty of ways to make more money if you're willing to put in the time third once you have enough money saved up I would highly recommend you either reduce or eliminate your housing expense altogether by doing what's called house hacking this is where you buy a multi-family property like a duplex Triplex or fourplex,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
7C6roAxktuI,and then you rent them out while living in one of the units typically when you do this right the other units will pay for your entire cost of living allowing you to stay there for free while getting to buy a property at the exact same time instantaneously that could free up your entire housing payment and just by saving that twenty to fifty percent difference you're going to be on track to a million dollar net worth that much faster and fourth if you have an interest in house hacking you could repeat that process every 18 to 24 months for example banks allow you to get a low interest fixed rate loan is a primary residence up to four units as long as you intend to live in the property for the first year that means you could buy a cash flowing property move in one of the units wait for another one to come along buy that that went out the previous unit and start the process over again while gaining equity and cash flow at the exact same time or if that's not your thing at the very least if you do this once it's possible to reduce your housing expenses significantly so that that way you could invest the difference,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
7C6roAxktuI,but I get it since everyone wants specific numbers to follow here you go if you're 20 years old and you want one million dollars by the time you're 30 you'll have to invest 4 750 a month at an eight percent return so if you could find a way to average a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year before taxes while living off three thousand dollars a month you could achieve that goal of course like I mentioned some Investments might help speed this up depending on how involved you want to be like with real estate if you're able to save up fifty thousand dollars you could use that to buy and renovate a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar two to four unit building if you find the right deal a strategic renovation should be able to increase that property's value to three hundred thousand dollars and all of a sudden you've doubled your initial investment all of a sudden if you're able to replicate that strategy every 18 to 24 months you could reach 1 million dollars a lot faster now this seems far-fetched this was literally the example of Mike rosehart quiet on my channel a few years ago he's a prime example of someone who grew to a million dollar portfolio while working a day job without any crazy income he just lived extremely frugally invested everything he could did a lot of the work himself and learned as he went along but fine what about for everyone else who doesn't have an interest in doing that and doesn't make a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year well the honest answer is if you're already saving as much money as you can and you don't have enough discretionary income left over then you'll have to increase your income by either shopping around the job market learning a new skill or taking on a side hustle at the end of the day building up a one million dollar portfolios all about the numbers and even though your spending tends to be the easiest to control to point you in the right direction your income is going to be the speed at which you hit your target so by lowering your overhead while increasing your income and diligently investing the difference you could work backwards to be a millionaire in 10 years without being any more complicated than that so with that said you guys thank you so much for watching as always feel free to add me on Instagram and don't forget that the brokeragepublic.com Graham is giving you the opportunity to earn all the way up to ten thousand dollars as a bonus depending on how much you transfer from another brokerage so if you're interested the link is down below and I'm posting my thoughts on the market there every single week,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

ryQsJm1a5qc, all right so if you ever asked investors who they thought was the most prolific the most iconic and the best investor of all time is most Finance nerds like me would tell you probably Jim Cramer in his inverse Kramer ETF but the second best investor of all time definitely Warren Buffett and that's because from 1965 to 2022 his portfolio made 3.7 million percent returns compared to the Market's Total return of 24.7 000.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,he has outperformed the stock market by almost 10 percent since 1965 to 2023 and that's why people affectionately call him the Oracle of Omaha he's kind of like the grandfatherly investor figure that we all wish we had and him and his partner Charlie Munger created a company called Berkshire Hathaway it's a massive corporation that invests into high quality companies companies like American Express Bank of America Kraft Heinz Coca-Cola and many others and today that company is the sixth most valuable company in the world with over 7 100 billion dollars in market cap and it also has the single most valuable stock in the world each share of Berkshire Hathaway is valued at almost half a million dollars basically like flexing with a reshard mill on your wrist but in stock form now some people also like to call Warren Buffett the king of passive income or the king of dividend investing because the companies he likes to buy tend to pay him dividends so many dividends in fact that just for context in 2022 the CEO of Apple Tim Cook made about a hundred million dollars for the entire year in compensation Berkshire Hathaway by comparison made 500 million dollars per month so Warren's company Berkshire Hathaway paid out in dividends five times in a single month with the CEO of Apple made throughout the entire year which is kind of insane to think about but also not a super fair comparison because Warren Buffett doesn't own a hundred percent of Berkshire Hathaway he owns about 15 so he made only 900 million dollars but still the point is he he's really smart and anytime he speaks people tend to listen and just this weekend they held Berkshire Hathaway's 59th annual shareholder meeting where anywhere between 40 to 50 000 people descended to Omaha Nebraska to watch him and Charlie Munger speak for five straight hours q a style and they covered everything from d dollarization in the end of the dollar the banking crisis the AI Revolution the stock market and its future their favorite stock and so much more so in today's video I want to share with you some of my favorite highlights from that five hour q a gold mine that most likely no one else watched but I did because I've got no friends but I do have you so let's get into it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,hi my name is Andre dick hope you're doing well come for the finance and stay for the one Warren Buffett impersonation Andre Andre says to why smash the like button and subscribe I don't know what that means but uh he says his life depends on it alright so I want to know you with those,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,but I do want to kick it off by showing you what Warren Buffett said about D dollarization and China's threat to the US dollar and this is incredible by the way just to remind you how big of a deal this annual convention is for everyone of all ages check this out over the past two years the Federal Reserve has telegraphed that they intend to monetize the debt by printing trillions of dollars even as they insist that they're fighting inflation already other major economies in the world such as China Saudi Arabia and Brazil are moving away from the dollar in anticipation of this my question is are we likely to face a time in the future when the U.S dollar is no longer the global Reserve currency how is Berkshire prepared for this possibility and what can we do as American citizens to attempt to shelter ourselves from what's beginning to look like the beginnings of dedolarization she's 13. she must have watched my video on D dollarization just kidding she's probably never seen it that was a chat GPT no,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,but Warren Buffett answers that question by saying no one can really understand the true answer to that question other than maybe Jerome Powell the chairman of the FED but even he wouldn't be able to predict how long a paper currency will last but as of right now the US dollar is the number one world Reserve currency and as of right now there is no viable alternative to it and that's really reassuring to hear considering how many times we've heard about the end of the US dollar even the reason challenge faced by the major U.S Bank what is your overall outlook on the banking industry how do you assess the risk and the opportunity in this section well anticipating a few questions on banks I decided we should start using Bank language here all right subscribe [Applause] they came with jokes and Charlie thank you [Applause] so the thing that really stuck out to me when it comes to the banking crisis question was when Warren Buffett recalled a story from the 1900s back when Banks were collapsing left and right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,and he recalled a person by the name of Sydney Weinberg who at the time was a janitor's assistant who would later become the leader of Goldman Sachs who in 1930 with the firm's fortunes plummeting into the abyss entrusted its future to the leadership of a five foot four inch Dropout from Brooklyn with an 8th grade education and scars on his back from knife fights as a Newsboy who had started at the firm more than 20 years earlier in the fall of 1907 as an assistant janitor he would sometimes stand in line in front of a bank and wait even though he didn't have a bank account with that bank he would later sell his place in line to someone else and that was considered an asset at the time because the closer up in line you were the higher the odds were that you might get your money back from a collapsing Bank of course times have changed since then with the creation of the FDIC and our deposits being insured up to 250 000 but as far as the consumer banking experience goes he says the country will be fine but from the investment side he does not like Bank stocks I think that the incentives in Bank regulation are are so messed up and so many people have an interest in having them messed up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,that is it's totally crazy I mean you'll have to have a punishment for the people that do the wrong thing and because of that he sold a majority of his commercial Banks from 2020 to 2022. he still has a couple Holdings like Ally Bank Bank of America and Citigroup but for the most part he's been letting go of his bank stocks Because he believes because of the misaligned incentives in the banking system and no one's getting in trouble eventually they will and that will lead to reform which will eventually damage those Banks business models and then Charlie Munger sort of wrapped it up and put a bow on it and here's what he said I don't think having a bunch of Bankers all of them were trying to get rich leads to good things next up they were asked about artificial intelligence as Ai and Robotics continue to advance what do you believe will be the positive and the negative impact of this technology on both the stocks market and society as a whole,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,so I thought this one was really interesting because Charlie and Warren have slightly different opinions on AI Charlie Munger is sort of dismissive of AI and he says that there's nothing that can compare to good old-fashioned intelligence I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well and this is where most people on the internet would probably disagree because most of us are probably on the younger side so we just dismiss their opinions and say Well they're just too old and they don't get it and they don't have to deal with that in their lifetime but remember before we dismiss their opinion they went through something like this in their lifetime with the creation of the atom bomb but was it a good creation for the next 200 years of humanity probably not so he recognizes that once something is done it can't be undone and the power of AI does have the power to change the world but also he says new technology is not going to change human thought and human behavior and that What Makes Us fundamentally human those wants and those needs that will stay the same,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,and I thought that was really insightful and a really calming voice of reason in the face of all the fear about what AI will do in the future with AI uh it it can change everything in the world except how men think of behave,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,and that's that's a big step to take now when it comes to investing overall Charlie Munger says that as far as value investing goes investors should expect lower returns from the stock market I think value investors are going to have a harder time now that there's so many of them competing first a diminished bunch of opportunities so my advice to Value investors is to get used to making less so Warren Buffett says that in the short term a lot of the companies in their portfolio will report lower earnings this year than they did last year but overall 10 years from now Berkshire Hathaway will be doing much better than they are today that's because ultimately the world will never run out of investing opportunities and that's because of this new things coming along don't take away the opportunities what gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things and uh [Applause] and people doing dumb things is exactly why Berkshire Hathaway has a huge cash pile of a hundred thirty billion dollars it's up two billion dollars from the beginning of this year because he's waiting for people to do dumb things and to me it's fascinating to see what they could be doing with all that money but what they aren't because the investors of Berkshire Hathaway have reached a point that they want to see some sort of dividends all this cash should be given technically to their investors but Warren Buffett believes he has better ideas for ways to invest the cash now he could also take the cash and reinvest it and buy some of his own stock back because he believes even though right now Berkshire Hathaway had half a million dollars a share is still technically undervalued he would still rather preserve the cash and wait for opportunities AKA for people to do dumb things what we really like to do is buy great businesses if we could buy a company 50 billion or 75 billion uh 100 billion we could do it a number of very decent companies I've got a very uncomfortable borrowing structure and money comes due due to them at the exact wrong time and that's when they pick up a phone as did in 2008 that sort of thing will happen again so he does expect Hard Times ahead not necessarily a repeat of 2008,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,and if there is a recession a lot of people tend to lose their jobs so they're not in a position to take advantage either Warren Buffett approach is to be patient to build up your cash position and then take advantage of those opportunities if and when they happen now they were also asked about their favorite stock and they said that the one business that's unlike any other business that they own is Apple and if I had to give up a second car or give up their iPhone they'd give up their second car I mean it's it's an extraordinary probably we don't have anything like that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,but we own a hundred percent of but we're very very very happy to have 5.6 or whatever it may be percent and we're delighted every tenth of a percent that goes up it's like adding a hundred million dollars to our earnings now arguably some of the best advice that he gave from that five hour long q a session wasn't even investing related it was just general life advice and here are two of my favorite things he said you should write your obituary and try and figure out how to live up to it how many of us go through life and then in our 30s or 40s sometimes 50s sometimes 60s say to ourselves I don't know what I want to do with my life and so what I really like about this advice is that he says to write down all of the achievements all the accomplishments all the qualities and all the things you want to be remembered by at the end of your life and then find a way to reverse engineer the process,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,and I thought that's a really cool way of handling it my second favorite life advice from Warren Buffett though was this and then give another General piece of advice I've I've never known anybody that was basically kind that died without friends and I've known plenty of people's money that have died without friends uh including their family I really resonate with this life advice,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ryQsJm1a5qc,and I aspire to it because I think kindness goes a long way kindness is the rarest and most undervalued form of intelligence that exists especially today where tweeting someone or making a video about their mistake or something else is rewarding in some way whether optically socially or financially and Warren Buffett says that we all have the option to be negative tomorrow that option is never going to go away but before you exercise it and say something negative think about the consequences because once it's said it cannot be unsaid and that's really important especially in today's day and age where we all have the option to do that all the time every day in some cases anonymously so don't Abilify other people to prove your point because if your idea works it will be heard so rather than tearing other people down just show people a better path because that's ultimately way more helpful to the world go check out the full video if you're ever bored because there's so much more information that I didn't cover in this video but in the meantime stay safe keep focusing on your own investment Journey have a wonderful rest of your day smash the like button subscribe if you haven't already don't forget to grab your free stocks links are all down below go track them automatically with a spreadsheet link Down Below in my patreon love you thank you so much for watching this video I'd love to see you back here on Monday Friday sometimes Wednesday see you soon bye-bye,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc, if you want to be rich don't do dividends and don't invest do this instead step one stop buying groceries you don't need to eat food you can eat motivation especially if you're serious okay step two stop buying lattes that's five dollars a day multiplied by 365 days a year with compound interest that's 1.5 million dollars of savings that you're missing out on all right now step three with that money you're gonna buy yourself a Lamborghini but instead of driving it you're gonna flip it for a 10x profit and with the profits you made from flipping the Lamborghini you're gonna buy yourself a house but instead of living in it you're gonna live inside an LLC while you rent the house out to someone else for passive income then you're going to take out 20 Equity out of that house to buy yourself another house rinse and repeat and that's how the rich live like the one percent and the last step buy my course and I'll show you how to live inside an LLC for free for a limited time only every Facebook and Instagram ad ever okay Jokes,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,Aside technically that's what we're up against so in today's video I want to show you how not to get rich by building actual passive income by showing you how I've been able to do it technically I haven't done it yet I'm still doing it because investing is a never-ending Journey but if you ever find yourself stressed at work sometimes you have to pause and take a moment to remind yourself what you're ultimately working towards foreign so with that said here's my portfolio right here press F to pay respects and call me an amateur for using Robinhood but Andre that exceeds the 500 000 Insurance limit and to those people I say that's true I'm an idiot I should probably do that it's on my list of things to do but I'm no expert and I don't claim to be and with that said Dividends are not going to make you rich well technically they will,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,but it's just going to take a very long time but the earlier you start the better off you'll be because if you don't start saving until you're 45 you'll need to save three times as much as if you start at 25. the first best time to start investing was yesterday and the second best time is right after you smash the like button and watch this video so let's get into it hi my name is Andre dick hope you're doing well come for the finance and stay for the comment of the week which goes to this guy who says Andre Dix the type of guy who eats his alphabet cereal in alphabetical order and there you have it so first I want to show you my dividend portfolio update,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,and then I want to share with you the passive income and how it's doing and that'll be really interesting to see considering how many bank failures we've had and all of these warnings over a recession and then later in the video we'll talk about staying healthy because I've been having this nasty cough my doc says it's a bad case of uh pressed educitation look it up it's a real word it means magic tricks for entertainment now before we start a few quick disclaimers I do not have any courses to sell you yet I have no Netflix show teaching you how to be rich I have no webinars or seminars or emails for you to sign up for this is 100 completely free and because this is my personal finance Journey I'm not encouraging anyone else to follow in my footsteps this is just what I'm doing and ultimately I make Finance videos and combine them with silly magic tricks,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,so I'm not licensed to do those either with that said let's get started and make some money disappear starting with my portfolio value which is actually up seven and a half percent which translates to about fifty one thousand dollars and that's why they call compound interest the eighth wonder of the world because this portfolio which has taken me roughly eight years to build has now made me in the first four months of this year what I was making from my day job eight years ago fifty thousand dollar per year and that's what's really cool about compound interest,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,is that at a certain point your portfolio will make you more money while you sleep than you could ever make from your day job and what's really cool about that is that you don't have to be a financial expert or a professional stock picker to be able to build this so let me show you the breakdown of starting with the income according to statistics the average retirement account generates less than 400 a month in income that's only about five thousand dollars per year for the average retired person which is a little too low in my opinion and we want to be better than the average so let me show you my progress starting with January where I made 603 dollars now that is a four percent increase over last year's January now is that good or is that bad for me that's pretty good because my average growth is about 2.5 percent for my dividend income now in February I made 877 dollars and four cents which is a five percent increase over last year's February and March was a huge one I made a whopping 2 486.68 which was a sixty four point seven percent increase now the reason this happened is because I invested a ton of money in 2022 and it makes sense that it's in 2023 that I'm getting to collect the fruits of my labor also because most stocks pay us quarterly meaning every three months and that's why the months of March June September and December have always historically paid the most and you can see this since I've been tracking my dividend income since all the way back in 2014,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,but that's definitely one downside of dividend investing is that incomes are sort of all over the place and that's because some stocks pay us monthly but most stocks pay us quarterly now moving on in April I made about 580 which was only a point seven percent increase over last year's April now all in all I've made four thousand six hundred twenty dollars and twenty cents this year which is about a thousand dollars more than where I was this same time last year so it's pretty cool to see that the dividend snowball is growing but now let me show you what it's expected to generate in the future and this is the exciting part,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,so let's Assume My Portfolio continues to grow at the same rate that it has been and I only contribute my dividend income back into itself it shows me that this year I'm expected to make a total of Sixteen thousand four hundred dollars and that's pretty cool because that's a 20 increase over last year's income and remember that's not because I'm a stock picking genius it's because I invested a lot of money last year now it also shows me that my highest source of income is coming from one stock 33.7 percent now this is a huge rule breaker if this was one company it should never be more than 10 percent but vti is an ETF that has over 4 000 stocks in it which I'll talk about in a little bit it also shows me that my dividend yield is only 2.23 and that's because half of my portfolio is made of dividends and the other half is made of the S&P500 but check this out I love this next part let's assume that I contribute nothing to my portfolio and I only reinvest my dividends and that's it and I stop investing because I don't know how long YouTube will last maybe I won't be able to put in a hundred dollars a day and I'll have to stop let's say that 20 years from now I continue doing this which I know sounds like a long time from now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,but that's gonna happen anyway regardless if we wanted to or not in 20 years from now it's estimated that I will make forty seven thousand seven hundred dollars that's almost 50k and most of that income will be tax-free because of how Dividends are taxed that's insane because that's like a social security retirement income right here that I've built and it's automatically putting me on that path to just have no matter what happens who knows if Social Security is going to be around by the time we're 67 or whatever the retirement age will be and I think that's worth sacrificing 10 years of my life to save a lot of money live below my means and not go out as much with my friends right I think it's worth it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,it's worth it anyway that's the income side and now let me show you how I built it now most of what I'm investing in nowadays can be broken down into two separate categories investing for growth and Investing For passive income by buying those dividend stocks but with both of these categories I try to avoid buying individual stocks I used to buy single stocks back when I first started investing and that's why I still have a bunch of them left over from when I first started companies like apple Johnson and Johnson Aflac Emerson Exxon Mobil these are great companies that I hope will be around 20 to 30 years from now but I don't know for sure will axon Mobil evolve into a renewable energy company or will it die off like a dinosaur stay tuned for the next episode of can this Millennial actually retire I have no idea,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,but that's why in the year 2000 for example Fortune Magazine published an article called top 10 stocks to last the decade by December 2012 though a portfolio that had those 10 stocks lost 74.3 percent of its value so just because they've done well in the past says nothing about where they're going in the future and that's why I really like to look at ETFs now an ETF is one stock that tracks a specific criteria and within the ETF are a bunch of stocks that fit within the criteria and there's an ETF for basically everything from dividend ETFs to Tech ETFs like QQQ which only has tech companies inside of it there's even ones called long Kramer and inverse Cramer which tracks everything Jim Cramer buys and buys the same thing and there's one that basically shorts it and does the opposite if it exists there's an ETF for it most likely now what's really cool about ETFs is if for example if this box of playing cards wasn't ETF inside of it you get a bunch of playing cards companies that represent that thing and each of these playing cards is one company now what's nice is if one of these companies Falls away and maybe goes bankrupt or isn't doing well this company gets automatically booted and replaced by something better inside the ETF now that one ETF stock then averages out the performance of all the other stocks inside of it and that's how it works you don't want to know how long this took to perfect,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,but uh This Is How We Do It Anyway the point I'm trying to make is that if you're actively picking individual stocks you have to spend a lot of time managing them to make sure that every one of them is healthy and they're not going to go bankrupt anytime soon and that takes a really long time and I don't want to do that because I want to automate my investing and make it super easy and straightforward and not have to check it every single day so here are some of my favorite dividend style ETFs the first one is sphd which is actually an ETF that tracks the top 52 52 that's subliminal marketing right there there's 52 cards in a deck that's why I fell for this anyway there's 52 companies that are the highest dividend yielding that are also the least volatile in terms of price movement,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,so that's what it tracks now that's the upside is that it pays monthly and that makes it really easy to plan for your expenses and your income in retirement but the downside is that it has an expense ratio that's kind of high at point three percent now I realize that doesn't sound like a lot point three percent you're like I got that but point three percent adds up for example an ETF called Arc invest Ark which is managed by the very famous Kathy Wood very popular ETF has an expense ratio of only 0.75 so only about twice as much but that translates to a 20 smaller portfolio when factored over 30 years just 0.75 just three quarters of a percent when Factor over 30 years means that you're gonna make one-fifth less than the amount you should have had just because of a small fee that most people will just ignore so just pay attention to that because a good fee that's low usually starts with point zero something percent like schd another very popular dividend ETF from Charles Schwab that tracks the top 100 dividend paying companies now the benefit of this ETF is that it is a very low expense ratio of point zero three percent,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
b2-wP0UEERc,so that's nice another one is vym which is vanguard's high dividend yield ETF another very popular one and the IG which is dividends for growth now the differences between all of these ETFs is relatively small but if you've made it this far into the video you're probably going to go down that rabbit hole later and that's fine as long as you start investing right away because you'll ask the right questions as you go I realize that's a lot of choices and none of these specific ETFs was a recommendation for anyone to invest in this is just a good place to start for some research,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,but with that said let me show you my portfolio in comparison to the rest of the market and how I'm investing right now and by the way just to show you that I'm not a particularly good stock picker you can see that over the past week my portfolio is down roughly one percent as compared to the S&P500 which remember is voo as it's represented by the ETF stock and if we scroll to the right in the last month it's down seven percent but year to date my portfolio actually is beating the stock market surprisingly now if we look at the sector breakdown in other words the different types of stocks in the economy you can see that I've actually outperformed most sectors including utilities materials Consumer Staples financials select the banks communication Services I'm down on my health care stocks I'm up on energy up on Industrials but the one that I'm down the most on is consumer discretionary stocks,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,oh and by the way some examples of this consumer discretionary stocks in this sector is if we just ask chat GPT right here companies like Disney Nike Home Depot McDonald's Starbucks Target Netflix General Motors Ford companies like that and all it takes is one or two bad Investments that I've made into coinbase into Corsair gaming and that offset the entire portfolio if I had just stuck to my dividend investing strategy I would have been a lot better off but the point is I'm not a particularly good stock picker and most people won't be because 40 percent of all stocks fell at least 70 percent or more since 1980 and never recovered so 40 years from now based on the historic past almost half of all the companies that exist today will most likely not be around tomorrow they'll either get bought out they'll consolidate or they'll go bankrupt so if you want the best overall return join the Dark Side by the broad market index funds and chill for 20 years while you make money that's the truth,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,but and I know some experts will disagree I can make a strong argument why dividend investing is the better strategy for a lot of people in some cases and the biggest reason is because it's a lot more reliable and predictable to plan for retirement because you can measure your income against expenses and plan for it that way because you don't have to sell off your principal investment meaning you don't sell off your stocks you just live off the interest that they generate,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,and that's really important because if you tried to quit your job in 2008 during a recession it was really tough for retirees because they had to sell their stocks when the market was really down and with dividends you don't have to do that generally speaking the longer you hold the stocks the more you get paid also Dividends are considered to be a lot less volatile than the General stock market but the most important thing is that in a sideways market like the one we might get in the next 10 years the dividend investor could beat the S&P500 and that's because as you're getting paid and you're reinvesting back into the market you're accumulating more shares but someone is holding the S&P500 is just going sideways for 10 years and nothing much will happen,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,but really the best part is that the income stays the same regardless of what the stock price is worth so if your ETF goes down by 10 percent your income will stay the same relative to your cost basis assuming those companies don't cut their dividends which most high quality companies don't the point is I think Dividends are great and a wonderful way to invest,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
b2-wP0UEERc,and it's one of my favorites and that's why I'm contributing 100 per day into Charles Schwab's schd dividend ETF and another 100 a day into vti now this is not a recommendation for anyone to follow in my footsteps this is just what works for me and what works for me may not work for anyone else it just depends on your goal your personality your age what you like there's no right or wrong way of doing this because it's called personal finance because it's personal to you so focus on your own investment Journey keep on going have a wonderful rest of your day smash the like button subscribe if you haven't ready don't forget to grab your free stocks links are down below and then go track them automatically with a spreadsheet linked Down Below in my patreon love you thank you so much for watching this video I'll see you back here on Monday Friday sometimes a Wednesday see you soon bye-bye,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

L8W1tbEVyOM,so let's get started now there's really three first uh initial things that we need to do before we even consider saving money and the first one is we need to set these overall kind of broad goals to understand where we want to be 12 months from now 5 years from now and 20 years from now just general ideas of do you want to be a multi-millionaire,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

L8W1tbEVyOM,or maybe you just want to have enough money to pay for family vacations you just want to have a nice cushion of cash or investments saved up so that you're not struggling to pay your bill so decide where you want to stand there do you want to be a billionaire you want to be warren buffett or do you want to not set goals as high because it's important to know that so that you can kind of plan for the future and know how serious you have to be about saving money in order to reach those goals now the second step is really really crucial to actually achieving financial success and and being able to save money effectively and that is by creating a very simple personal budget a monthly budget i have a free budget template down in the description if you're interested in using it it's on google drive or you could just create your own on something like microsoft excel or you could go old school get out a pen and a paper and just start creating a budget write down all of your monthly expenses and your total income on a monthly basis and that way you can see where the money's coming in and where it's going out if you're not measuring and calculating your cash inflows and outflows you're going to have a lot of issues actually trying to save money if you don't know what's going on and you don't know where that money's going you don't know how much money you're spending on food and how much you're spending on all these other various expenses in our life it can really pile up and really get ahead of you so you want to get ahead of this and create a budget uh,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
L8W1tbEVyOM,or maybe you just want to have enough money to pay for family vacations you just want to have a nice cushion of cash or investments saved up so that you're not struggling to pay your bill so decide where you want to stand there do you want to be a billionaire you want to be warren buffett or do you want to not set goals as high because it's important to know that so that you can kind of plan for the future and know how serious you have to be about saving money in order to reach those goals now the second step is really really crucial to actually achieving financial success and and being able to save money effectively and that is by creating a very simple personal budget a monthly budget i have a free budget template down in the description if you're interested in using it it's on google drive or you could just create your own on something like microsoft excel or you could go old school get out a pen and a paper and just start creating a budget write down all of your monthly expenses and your total income on a monthly basis and that way you can see where the money's coming in and where it's going out if you're not measuring and calculating your cash inflows and outflows you're going to have a lot of issues actually trying to save money if you don't know what's going on and you don't know where that money's going you don't know how much money you're spending on food and how much you're spending on all these other various expenses in our life it can really pile up and really get ahead of you so you want to get ahead of this and create a budget uh,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
L8W1tbEVyOM,and and it's a pretty simple step but it's something that so many people just neglect and they don't do because they just are kind of lazy or they just don't feel like they need to do it but i'm telling you if you're trying to save the most amount of money this is how i went from saving almost nothing to being able to save a lot more money was by using a budget now the third step along here is to create more specific goals so you have those initial goals of where you want to stand financially from years from now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

L8W1tbEVyOM,but then you want to set these these secondary goals the ones that are more short-term where you can say you know what looking at my budget that i just calculated right here i want to be able to take this and be able to save 500 a month or maybe 100 a month whatever you can afford maybe a thousand dollars a month or maybe ten thousand dollars a month it depends on your income and that's totally understandable so be realistic with yourself maybe start with small amounts and then maybe expand that as you go on as you get more experienced with budgeting and making smarter financial decisions but find out where you can be for that budget for setting those monthly savings goals and those yearly savings goals now there's really five different uh what i would say essential needs of people that are very important to address and we're going to dig into each one of those five and the first one is food,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

L8W1tbEVyOM,and then we have shelter then we have transportation clothing and health those are really the five we're going to dig into all five of those in just a minute here but really one of the biggest uh keys to actually saving money for myself regardless of anything else any other ideas that people might have mentioned in the past the one that was the most effective for me was by really implementing this super simple but so effective strategy and it was by setting up automatic withdrawals with my bank so look what i have set up now is i have money flowing into one primary account,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
L8W1tbEVyOM,and then we have shelter then we have transportation clothing and health those are really the five we're going to dig into all five of those in just a minute here but really one of the biggest uh keys to actually saving money for myself regardless of anything else any other ideas that people might have mentioned in the past the one that was the most effective for me was by really implementing this super simple but so effective strategy and it was by setting up automatic withdrawals with my bank so look what i have set up now is i have money flowing into one primary account,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
L8W1tbEVyOM,but i don't really use this account too much it's sort of like a shell account because after this money comes in my income comes into this one account and then it gets distributed through automatic withdrawals to various various other accounts uh so automatically 30 of my income goes directly into investments uh and savings accounts so 30 gets thrown into there now i'm left with 70 to then use for the cost of living to pay for my rent to pay for my food to pay for health expenses to pay for any other expenses you might have that's what that other 70 percent is and you can decide this for yourself if you want to set this maybe you want automatically withdraw 10 or 20 or more whatever you can personally afford out of your budget that you already calculated previously then you can decide how much you're able to do but look i'm telling you this is incredibly important to do because with these automatic withdrawals you want to set this up on the day that you get your paycheck so the day that money gets put into your account you have automatically withdrawn 30 of that or whatever percentage that you are able or capable of of doing then automatically withdrawals gets put into savings accounts or investment accounts iras whatever your heart might desire uh to put into something,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
L8W1tbEVyOM,but i don't really use this account too much it's sort of like a shell account because after this money comes in my income comes into this one account and then it gets distributed through automatic withdrawals to various various other accounts uh so automatically 30 of my income goes directly into investments uh and savings accounts so 30 gets thrown into there now i'm left with 70 to then use for the cost of living to pay for my rent to pay for my food to pay for health expenses to pay for any other expenses you might have that's what that other 70 percent is and you can decide this for yourself if you want to set this maybe you want automatically withdraw 10 or 20 or more whatever you can personally afford out of your budget that you already calculated previously then you can decide how much you're able to do but look i'm telling you this is incredibly important to do because with these automatic withdrawals you want to set this up on the day that you get your paycheck so the day that money gets put into your account you have automatically withdrawn 30 of that or whatever percentage that you are able or capable of of doing then automatically withdrawals gets put into savings accounts or investment accounts iras whatever your heart might desire uh to put into something,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
L8W1tbEVyOM,and then you're left with a certain percentage to then live off of them i don't want to say trick yourself into thinking that you have a certain income but the way that i like to do it is i then say you know what i'm not making x amount of dollars i'm only making 70 of that and i tell myself look i have to live off of this and disregard that other 30 percent it's a great way to really save money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
L8W1tbEVyOM,and it's hard to go wrong with it in a lot of cases uh by using this strategy so there's really five different needs that are pretty essential for most humans now within these five needs there's ways to cut back on each of these categories and we're going to dig into these the first one is food this is one of my favorite ones to cut back on and the reason for this is because food is one of the most depreciating assets you could ever imagine i mean if you spend 20 on a meal you eat the meal now there's nothing on your plate and there's no value left over you basically could have just eaten that 20 bill because that's the effect that has on your wallet so cutting back on food costs can be really effective there's various ways to do this uh stop eating out as much make your own food and also consider buying products that are not branded but more so store brand uh products can save you fifty dollars a month hundred dollars a month or more depending on how much you're spending at the moment on food,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
L8W1tbEVyOM,but i love cutting back on food without depriving yourself of nutrients make sure you're getting good food in your body and that is very important now the next one is with shelter the cost of shelter is difficult to avoid that one one of the best ways to cut your cost of your apartment or house in half is to get a roommate or consider renting out a room in your home through something like airbnb to cut the cost of living for yourself literally in half now there's also some other ways you can go about this if you're not interested in getting a roommate or you already have a roommate you could consider cutting some utility costs like for example wi-fi or electrical there's ways to actually cut these costs and so most people think that there's only one electrical provider or one wi-fi provider when really you could look into various companies that are offering similar products and shop around a little bit more and just because you've been using the same provider for the past 10 years doesn't mean that you shouldn't look into getting a different one because what happens and and this happens with other utilities as well so for example waste management trash companies for example will jack up the price over time without people really realizing until you look and you say wait a minute this bill is three times higher than your competition so you switch to the competition so make the year on make sure that you're on top of that switching to various different providers for various utilities to get the most effective use of your money number three is transportation now this is one that is very difficult to avoid as well but the bureau of labor statistics estimates that the average cost of operating and owning a vehicle is close to about nine thousand dollars per year i'll leave a link to that down below because i was kind of taken aback when i read that at first but the cost of owning and operating a vehicle is very expensive especially if you're racking up a lot of miles on it people don't always consider this look you're paying for auto insurance you're paying for uh the vehicle expenses you're paying for gas you're paying for all these different issues that might pop up with the vehicle you need new tires you need to get it inspected you need to get a new alternator and it runs up a lot of money so look if you live in an urban or even a suburban area where there's some type of public transportation or even uber sometimes you might want to consider thinking whether or not it's actually worth it for you to own a vehicle and how much you're using that vehicle versus something like public transportation run those numbers i highly suggest that because cars are a money pit they're difficult to avoid especially if you're in rural areas like myself it's difficult to not have a vehicle i did it for a while but eventually i had to end up getting a vehicle but look if you can cut back those it's going to help you so much now there's two more here that are very essential clothing this is one that's very easy to cut back on the best way to cut back on the cost of clothing uh what i found is to unsubscribe from all these different emails from clothing providers uh they're giving you sales and discounts and it's it's look email marketers are paid to do something uh that they're very good at and they're very effective at it that's why they're still making money and they're still sending these emails because they're effective look when you're getting those emails where it says 40 off sale of this clothing store people end up buying clothes so what i do i unsubscribed from all of those different uh email providers and and emails that i was getting and that way i wasn't tempted to go out and buy something because i got an email about a special sale on something that i didn't really need or want but ended up buying so unsubscribe from those emails and if you're really pinching pennies if you're really in a kind of an area where you need to start saving more money you're on a tight budget i would consider going to something like a thrift store or goodwill or salvation army if you need to go to that there's no shame in that look i've done it in the past,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

CRt135W9Imc,like wow it would be really amazing to have some equity in some of these companies i remember with weeble i remember they had like three people in their office i went to it in 2018 or 2019 and it was a tiny little company all of a sudden everybody started promoting them and and working with them they launched a huge like influencer campaign and next thing you know they're worth billions of dollars influencers you know they made some money they got cash but thinking back retrospectively would have been amazing to have some equity in those companies exactly especially when they're earlier on and they're like hey we can't really pay you that much because we're nearly say startup what about five bucks and then they go from being worth 50 million to 250 million to then a billion and now maybe five billion so i think for content creators there is a huge opportunity to at least get some skin in the game yeah and and it's it's,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CRt135W9Imc,i love getting on the cap table for these companies because i feel like there's this great value-add prospect that creators and influencers can have for founders because obviously a lot of influencers they're going to understand rates they can understand some things about especially organic growth of marketing that founders find valuable so personally i found it's not terribly difficult to get on the cap table of these companies right even beyond that i think just understanding what to look for i've seen a bunch of companies that are like oh this person has a million subscribers but then you tell them hey maybe look at the last five videos lost 10 videos and like how much engagement is there how much how many views are there and you realize that it's inflated either because they bought it or because maybe they had one or two viral videos and maybe they're not worth that much you actually have a startup right now called subscribe,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CRt135W9Imc,yes subscribe.so so we're helping content creators get equity for marketing efforts because a lot of these early-stage companies even if they're venture-backed might not have the capital to pay what nate is worth beyond that i think it's about helping creators long-term because we have a shelf life and we want to make sure that we make the most of the time we have in the sun you've obviously started investing in a lot more companies as well what's been your thought process what has been your experience i have i have um i'm i'm trying to get into the early stage companies i prefer that over the late stage i feel like creators can help more with that you know if it's a company it's already worth five billion dollars it's gonna be harder to have that you know say hey look i have a million subscribers can i help you with the five billion dollar companies it's a lot harder to to sell that um but for uh founders who maybe are in you know pre-seed seed series a,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CRt135W9Imc,it's definitely been a lot easier i think the cool thing is that we can actually help them with growth obviously and we see so many companies whether it's subscriber whether it's a content creator our inboxes are full of deals and we kind of get that behind the scenes of all of this because i think when they're talking to creators they're a lot more open than talking to other funds i know you gotta run in a couple minutes but should we talk about the fund real quick yeah because i feel like it'd be unfair not to tell them so we just launched a 506 c rolling fund through angel list uh we have a ton of creators uh as lps so i think it's going to really be just something that we're both very excited for yep i think it's a pretty interesting opportunity for people who are obviously content creators to add value can skim the game and just invest in the future of these cool companies,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

sm9m1pwatcI," - So here's something that you need to know about me. I'm not a violent person. I have never been in a fight. Okay, so there was one fight, but that dude totally deserved it. But when it comes to this topic, this topic, this deserves to put the gloves on. ♪ I'm gonna knock you out ♪ ♪ What ♪ ♪ Mama said knock you out ♪ ♪ What ♪ - Because in this video, I am getting in a fight, and there are seven financial advisors that I want to punch in the face. Who are these financial advisors? You're gonna find out who these suckers are right now. (upbeat music) What's going on, y'all? Welcome to channel Wealth Hacker Labs. I am your host Jeff Rose, and this is the channel dedicated to teaching you new ways to grow wealth that is not taught to you in schools or by your parents, and I probably need to take these off.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"All right, for real, so I've been a financial planner for over 16 years, and when you are in this business, you come across other financial advisors, either through competition or just hearing various stories from your existing clients or potential clients that you're trying to recruit for your business. So in my years of experience, I have encountered some pretty shady mother (beep). I'm trying to keep it PG here, because my kids do watch my videos. But seriously though, these are seven shady advisors that if I were to meet them in real life, I would probably give them a punch in the face and maybe a kick in the shin and probably a knee to the. ♪ Oh, my God ♪ - These are seven financial advisors that if I were to meet them in person, I would punch them in the face. I would kick them in the shin, and I'd probably kick them in the nuts too, because they deserve it, and they give other good financial advisors a bad name.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"And probably, if you met this type of advisor, if you've worked with this type of advisor, they have probably lost you money or taken money from you, because they're just shady. So who are these people? What do they do, what do you need to look out for? All right, the first financial advisor that deserves a punch in the face is the 12% advisor, and you could replace 12% with any other percentage that is larger than 6%. But here's the other part with that 12% advisor is that they say they will get you 12% return guaranteed, and the last time I checked, the stock market is not guaranteed. Sure, there are financial experts such as Dave Ramsey that will say that you can expect to get 12% return if you are investing into quality mutual funds. Now the stock market has averaged over 10% since its beginning. And in another video I shared about how the Vanguard S&P 500 fund, by far one of the largest index funds that exists with almost 500 billion assets, has averaged over 11% return.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"But with any of these numbers, the one thing that they all have in common is that they are not guaranteed, and I have came across more than one advisor that has met with their perspective clients and shared with them these illustrations on what the performance of the funds or the ETS or whatever it is they're trying to sell and sharing with them that they can expect to make 12% return, as if it's just a matter of fact, as if it's guaranteed to happen. And the one thing that these all have in common is that they are not guaranteed, and I've came across more than one advisors that when they are meeting with their perspective clients and they're sharing their illustrations, and their hypotheticals of what the performance could be, on whether it's a mutual fund or ETF, or whatever it is that they are trying to sell, they will look these people in the face and tell them that they can expect to make 12% per year guaranteed. - Say what? - It doesn't work like that people.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"So if you come across this advisor, you better punch them in the face, because if you don't, I will. - I must break you. - Right cross (heavy breathing). Get out, knockout, knockout. Advisor number two that deserves a punch in the face is the surrender charge conversation is optional advisor. So who is this advisor? This is the advisor that sells, typically, an insurance product, some sort of investment that has a surrender schedule attached to it. So that means if you buy this investment and if you need to liquidate, if you wanna sell it, say, in three to four years, you have to pay a hefty surrender charge. So you have to give up a big chunk of your principle just to get your money back, and I have came across so many advisors, that when they sell this investment to their clients, they didn't feel the need to disclose with them that there is a surrender charge to get their money back. You see that's shady, right? That's shady.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"Now, the advisor, they got paid a big, fat, upfront commission for that sale, so why would they want to volunteer that information that hey, Mr. and Mrs. Client, I'm gonna get paid a lot of money, but if you need your money back, you're actually gonna have to pay a large surrender to get your money back. So I'm just not gonna share that with you. You know, it's okay, all right. Peace, I'm out. Advisor number three is the telling the truth is optional advisor. So this advisor just doesn't feel the need to tell the truth. They may not tell the truth about the surrender charge. They might not tell the truth of how much you are paying in your fees to work with them. They just don't feel the need to tell the truth about anything, and it just doesn't really make sense to me. Now, typically, these type of advisors, you're gonna find them on FINRA BrokerCheck. There is going to be a complaint filed against them.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"And a lot of the advisors that I came across where it was blatant that they were not telling the truth on the investments that they were managing, or their investment style, or how often they were checking those investments. It was pretty typical that you could find that advisor, the telling the truth is optional advisor, on FINRA's BrokerCheck, because there was a complain filed against them. Which just a solid reminder, if you're going to work with a financial advisor, do a background check. Go online, do a Google search of that person to see if you find out anything about them. Go to FINRA's website, do their BrokerCheck search to see, are there any complaints. Are they legit? If they're a CFP, you can also go to CFP.net and also find out if there's anything that's been filed against them. Do your homework, do your research before you hire anybody to manage your money. Advisor number four is the I like to churn advisor. Now, the good thing is that this type of advisor is dying. This is a dinosaur.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"They don't exist as much, but there are still advisors that their prime way of making money is selling mutual funds, is selling stocks, is selling ETFs and earning a commission. In the past, I had a client that was working with this broker. They were out of New York. They sold him a mutual fund, which the advisor got paid an upfront commission, and then within six to nine months, they resold them another mutual fund that was a different share class. But the reason they did that was because the client didn't see the upfront cost. There wasn't a backend surrender charge on the investment that they sold them. So they got paid an upfront commission, had the client sell where their client didn't see anything coming out on the backend, and then resold them, basically, the exact same thing, getting paid an upfront commission, and the client not seeing that. That's what you call churn. Now churn is basically when an advisor is just buying and selling, not to your benefit, but just to make extra commissions, to get paid more money. And I promise you that is not in your best interest.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"It's only the advisor, and that's why this type of advisor deserves another punch in the face. Advisor number five is the I can use any investment that I want, I just happen to use my own company's investments advisor. Oh, this one, this one, I love it. This is the one, it's funny to me because it was so easy to point out how wrong this was. So what do I mean by this one? So let's say that you are working for an insurance company, and the insurance company has their own mutual fund products that you can sell, and you can also use other investments, let's just say like Vanguard, or Fidelity, or T. Rowe Price, but you are selling your own company's mutual funds because you think that is better for their client. So if you had these two mutual funds side-by-side and you see that your company's mutual funds, your fees are twice as high as everybody else, and even better, your return is 20% lower than everybody else, then why in the world are you going to sell them your crappy mutual funds when you can sell them everything else? Hmm.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"Is it because you're getting paid more to sell your company's mutual funds as apposed to somebody else's? Maybe, I'm just taking a wild guess here. And not to pick on any one company, but that's why I wasn't shocked to see that State Farm was getting rid of their investment component, their brokerage component. They didn't wanna mess with mutual funds anymore because of how their ranks have change. And they are one of the ones, if you looked at their mutual funds compared to everybody else, you just kinda ask the question, why do you even have mutual funds? Your mutual funds, they just suck. They don't do good compared to everybody else. You have no business doing that. Stick to insurance. Stick to your jingle. ♪ State Farm is there ♪ ♪ A good neighbor, State Farm is there ♪ What a ugly nigger . I'm not ugly. - All right, the sixth advisor that deserves a punch in the face is the I know that you're 80, and you should probably be in a CD, but I'm going to sell you an investment product that you don't need anyway.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"That is a mouthful, so what is this? So typically, once again, we're looking at annuities. Now annuities on their own are not a bad investment, but by far, they are one of the most mis-sold and misrepresented investments that exist. And one of the easiest people that you can take advantage of is the elderly. They want to be safe with their money. They don't want to lose their money. They want to protect what they have, what they preserved, and pass that on to their family, and there are some shady financial advisors that will just eat this up and sell them this guaranteed investment product. Now annuities do offer guarantees, but do you remember that whole surrender charge is optional conversation we had earlier? That typically is the case with a lot of these annuities. Now, I came across a very specific situation where an elderly client, this person was in their mid 70s, mid to late 70s, and an advisor came and sold them an annuity. Now, they bought it because they wanted to have their money safe.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sm9m1pwatcI,"They wanted to pass that on, but the advisor didn't feel the need to share that this investment product, this annuity product, had a 15-year surrender charge. 15 years, this person was gonna be 90 before they could actually touch their money in the case they needed it. Now, did the client think that they were gonna need the money? I don't know all that, but I do know that they had zero clue that this thing had a surrender charge, and I also know when I looked at their situation, there was no reason, there was no economic benefit for them to purchase this annuity. The only economic benefit was the commission that the advisor made on selling this annuity to this person. That's what I do know, and that's why this person deserved a punch in the face. - [Woman] There you go, there you go. - The last advisor that deserves a punch in the face is the my products don't have any fees advisor.

sm9m1pwatcI,"I was trying to get them to become a client of my firm, and there was another advisor that was also trying to court them, trying to win them as a client. And I remember that client, after he had met with this other person, this other advisor, and he mentioned to them that he was also talking to me. This advisor's response was, ""Now, you know, ""they have fees and our firm, our company, doesn't."" Just gimme a minute, just gimme a minute. So Mr. Advisor, basically what you're telling me is that your company, your investment firm is a charity. That you're doing this out of the kindness of your heart, and my big bad firm, we charge fees, so why would you wanna work with us. We're a business. We charge for what we do, but you're a charity. You do it just because you like people, and you just wanna do it for fun. You're kidding me, right? You're not a charity. You might not have fees that the clients can see, but you're a business.

And I also wanna know is there another type of advisor that you've came across that I didn't share? Because these advisors need to be called out, because there are some shady you know whats out there, and they deserve a punch in the face, and they deserve the recognition so that others don't get burned by their shadiness.

WGf_RE5Th_U,so here you can see the potential in the current timings for gold but let me tell you if you want to invest in gold there's this one opportunity but you can also invest in miners why it's this important because miners are there for exploration of gold resources you know as more as they you know have resources to dig as more there's potentially they find a lot of amount of gold and there it's important that they are going next to historical mines or historical founding areas in the ground around the world and us is known very much for that and that's why we're talking about today about a company that is a north american based company so let's talk about it right now so make sure you follow the link below because in the link below there is an article that you can see here where everything is again written in detail with all the tickers to the stock and you can see here that the gnc resources has two main mines,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
WGf_RE5Th_U,all right so they are looking for gold in malibu as well as the other place which is called sulumans and both are historically known for first environment friendly regions for gold miners in north america so this is a feel a good thing right we don't want to be associated with some miners in you know in in africa or somewhere else where you know maybe the the minings are a little bit sketchy you want to be feel you know secure and everything is done under fantastic circumstances and this is basically almost guaranteed if you're looking into american companies okay so this is an american company where they have these two minds which are historically also very much known for having gold resources and if you are scrolling down to the article that you will find into the description there's a couple of really important factors also that you should know about the gnc first the team is very experienced with about 75 years and this is a very long time guys in gold exploration and the second out of you know many many other reasons is that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

JvR9aC_y6Ts, you will know today what is the most important most successful most powerful investing strategy ever executed and invented I I don't even know if this is considered as investment strategy per se,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JvR9aC_y6Ts,but it's a hundred percent guaranteed to get rich so make sure you stay tuned I'm so excited to make this vlog this morning here in Dubai because this is one of the most important videos that you will watch on investing so make sure to stay tuned if you are new here make sure to subscribe because I'm vlogging daily about investing in stocks moreover ring the bells so you get notified when there's any video of or any video uploaded on my channel immediately and make sure to follow the Instagram and last but not least smash that like button why is this vlog so important today because first the investment strategy that I will show you today with scientific facts and history back the data is so easy and simple that anybody can do it a pro a beginner youngster or if you even already very late in the game however you know this strategy made the need lot of patience and made a lot of billionaires like Warren Buffett so make sure you stay tuned till the end to know about it so let's dive into it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JvR9aC_y6Ts,so the investment strategy that we will talk about today is actually buy-and-hold it's a passive strategy on the stock market where you actually buy undervalued companies or index funds and just hold them as long as possible this strategy if you call it a strategy have lot of famous advocates like for example warren buffett who says you know it's not about timing the market or choose specific stocks it's about you know have a broad diversity and also hold the stocks as long as possible this investment strategy is also very much working for real estate where you know you buy a property and you don't care about the price in 10 years 20 years and you just hold it as far as long as possible a possible timeframe for example is 50 years or 40 years,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JvR9aC_y6Ts,right so you buy the property at one point and live in it and so on so Warren Buffett have a very important and funny quote where he actually saying you know the stock market is like someone would come to your house every day and tell you the price and the price will go down will go up and you know it's not about that you hear the price and see the price you will directly sell the property right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JvR9aC_y6Ts,so this is how he actually made the anecdote to buy a house that's why it's so important to listen to it to it because he is one of the most important investors of our time and the most successful well he was you know an average person and became a millionaire by doing buy and hold so that's why it's so important so strong as investment strategy let's come to the next point index funds I will tell you exactly why it's so important to use index funds and to what is the return over the years also one of the most important and most famous index found is the Standard & Poor 500 was started actually 1926 with approximately 90 stocks and then they upgraded it to 500 stocks which is the you know 500 best stocks of us and they put it into one index fund and you can invest in this index fund and this index fund actually returned about 8% from inception to today every single year you know there was obviously fluctuations like you know one year minus 20 the other year plus five plus ten and so on super,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JvR9aC_y6Ts,but on average if you had put let's say thousand dollars this thousand dollars would be returned on investment eight percent per year if you just take the 90 stocks that the standard & poor's started as an index in 1926 it was even ten percent returns so you can see how important and how good this is if you just you know put your money there you don't have to look in it forget about it and it makes 8 percent per year this is very strong because you know which other investment can make such a let's say return on investment with such a low risk because if you're looking into the stock market you know this since 26 we had First World War Second World War we had different world wars or wars around the world we had financial crisis we had stock crashes and so on and still on average you made money a lot of money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JvR9aC_y6Ts,"okay how much this can be I will tell you because also we have to consider the exponential growth which is one of the strongest and most ridiculous concepts because this is how Warren Buffett actually made his billion so stay tuned and make sure to subscribe and found this video thank you very much and make sure also to subscribe and follow on Instagram because you know if you want to see something behind the scenes how this videos and vlogs are being made and what I'm doing during my day life make sure to follow so exponential growth is an important factor for very very successful buy-and-hold strategy why because you are holding it for a long time and then the possible gains like for example let's assume 10% are getting calculated on every dollar that is on the investment portfolio so as longer it grows as more it is as more gain it is percentage-wise on the portfolio so let's have an example we start with $1000 and let's say for a easy calculation way we are considering a 10% return on investment per year so this would be $1100 after the first year after 10 years like always the same return on average would be $2,600 ok so after 10 years you grow from 1,000 to $2,600 this is like a gain of 100 $1600 now have a look how this develops over the next 10 years so another 10 years if you just keep the money there it would be six thousand seven hundred dollars so you see we we grow from $1,000 to two thousand six hundred dollars to six thousand $700 so from the first thousand dollars we almost 1.5 our money but then almost tripled our money in the next run",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JvR9aC_y6Ts,and you know this continues obviously you know if we taking them another ten years this would be seventeen thousand five hundred dollars so another we almost again tripled our money and this is the beauty and it goes on and on and the most important part is that you know you try to improve and put as more as portfolio up as possible so a tip that I can give to it the average or pro investor is actually that you actually try to put as much as support for you as possible so over time obviously you want to accelerate that you know if you're listening to thirty years you know that's a very long time I'm not even 30 years old you know so you think like that's very very long horizont but consider that you know obviously we are living much longer you know so being 50 60 s is in our generation of the next generation much easier and you also have to consider that you can always put something inside the portfolio so let's say you start with a thousand dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JvR9aC_y6Ts,but you put every month two hundred dollars on top of that then obviously this will explode over time and this is the beauty of the exponential growth so I hope you got the concept and start to investing tomorrow of course you know this concept can be I will put some links into the description as well to read about it if you are interested in more of that and make sure to tune in tomorrow for more information and stay tuned thank you very much for watching peace [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

_bheTToKZIg,and that's why people lose is that we are then going into a double turn again where interest rates are raising for example,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
_bheTToKZIg,and this brings everything down economy you know just to reset everything because everything goes to Bubble everything goes to Crazy asset prices and then the FED need to steer a bit a little bit against it otherwise we go into like a huge bubble and then break uh down so they try to soft land the economy if it's really working out I don't think so but let's see so then you have to imagine that inflation goes Higher and Higher and you know then the FED tries to bring it down and you know with that also especially growth stocks like Tesla like space you know all the companies that have in the future a lot of Revenue uh those companies are usually sold off first and that's why we saw a huge crash in the stocks of Virgin Galactic now with that said if you want to know more about this macroeconomics and if you want to trade them with me I have a Trading Group if you have 5 000 or more then DM me on Instagram,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

_bheTToKZIg,and I'm still averaging down every month I put my excess money into Virgin Galactic I think from all of those people that text me of all of those people that um make videos on Virgin Galactic I think I have the biggest portfolio out there you know I'm just like a maniac either you know I go out of this like like a genius or you know I go down like a like a six Maniacs but I I just see the risking reward okay so let's talk about the share price over the last couple of weeks uh you know we gained over the last week about 15 okay another 15 on top uh on our portfolio if you're averaging down you are a very happy I hope you do uh you know it and this jump perfectly happened just after the 31st of January and I put every end of the month the money into Virgin Galactic so you know it's just like if if you want to time the market in long-term stocks just put in like every month and you will have always the best price okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_bheTToKZIg,so I believe now with more news with more rumors we will see the stock price going higher and higher right so I think that we could to have jumped on a short squeeze in the next couple of days because there's some rumors and this will be the second category where it's interesting to see if we really have test flights okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
_bheTToKZIg,so make sure to see the other category that I'm telling you now to watch and stay tuned and in the end of the video if you liked it you know share it with the people of Virgin Galactic and uh let's dive into the test flight so as I said very many many times we are an event stock right now okay that means like if there's an event you know Virgin Galactic is rising I made a video about that last Friday or last Saturday check that out if you want to know how many percentage did stock usually jumps on certain news and I think what you need to understand is that the next test flight or the announcement of a test light or you know hidden test facts are already a poverty around the corner because they just took the mothership out of the hangar which means like you know either they clean it cleaning it or or they will slide I think the latter,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

ojoVbLvtwUI, fasten your seatbelts because today we are talking about one of the most scandalous company out there that has maybe a great potential to rebound wolf of Dubai now I'm talking about Boeing let's dive into the stock directly immediately without any further ado let's dive into the stock of booing now booing is trading around two three hundred thirty two dollars as of this recording and we can see since March 2019 they lost about the quarter of their value and this is just one of the shocking things they also really really really sought less aircraft because of the Boeing 737 max now I made another video here on this channel about all the problems and the technicality of this issue but I want to talk about something that is breaking news right now and it's a big guy on Wall Street just considering to enter this beat-up stock they had a really big scandal the scandal got bigger,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ojoVbLvtwUI,I told you though not to buy because once scandal is discovered of such a stock or such a issue especially the security issue of such a airplane then there is more to come or to find out more costs they have to cover a lot a lot of expenses and actually there's the breaking news debt not other then Warren Buffett is considering to buy into booing and now Warren Buffett is one of the greatest stock investor of all the time that I know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ojoVbLvtwUI,and he is known for buying specialty American companies that got beaten up and that they have still lied on the horizont now I will tell you in the towards the end of this vlog why there's so much potential in the stock at this point I'm not so convinced that I would buy into the stock one of the sector one of the growing opportunities but on the other side Warren Buffett is really really known for buying into this opportunities for example in 2016 when episode of here you really start to buy an Apple because they have seen how beautiful this company is since then the company's just exploded in value and Warren Buffett just loved this crazy stable and long term companies like Apple or Boeing now you have to understand the aircraft market there's just two options for airlines or basically more or less to two options to buy aircraft one is Airbus that the European sectoral region is producing this at this this aircraft and on the other side you have the American competition Boeing now both from the quality build beautiful airplanes and dominate by at least 80 percent of the whole market but there was an incident a huge incident in March and therefore this stock went so much drastically down and the Boeing and this is something to really consider and maybe to wait a little bit that it still stabilizes so Boeing sold 800 aircrafts in 2008 now the numbers through this incident that they had with the Boeing 737 max that nobody want to fly with that out bounded and grounded everywhere in the whole world and there's no science at all now that it's going now further to be solved soon because they're cabling to change and all these things Boeing so to 400 so how 50% in 2019 compared to 2008 and it is a huge for this company now this is so huge that this is a huge hit for the revenues there's the huge for the image the CEO had to be there was no way that the current CEO could stand all this heat and said everywhere everything goes there had to be a change in the management indeed and now since the time that a big value investor like Warren Buffett sees the light on the end of the tunnel and invest into the company now you have to consider this company is stable for long and long off period of time and they are also paying about two point five dividend percentage on your investment as of now now we have to see if they will be able to pay the dividend because dividend is something that the company decides if they pay it out to investors or not and sometimes in critical situation like this companies maybe don't pay this extra cash because they have so much to pay now Boeing is taking on a little bit of more money and we have seen slowly that Warren Buffett on the market gets also active because there was rumors that Tiffany when they got the deal opportunity by LVMH that they first refused to accept that Tiffany went to Warren Buffett say hey do you don't want to buy Tiffany instead of the French group LVMH but Warren Buffett the client though he is sitting on in cash and this is unbelievable and in cash mountain of 128 billion dollars now this number,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ojoVbLvtwUI,it's not even telephone number anymore this is a very very long telephone number you know so most of the people in the world they will not even make in their whole lifetime 1 million dollars and this guy has 128 billion dollars sitting on the on her bank in cash now he seems to be little bit cautious about the current markets obviously the markets are really hi right now and this is not a reason that it cannot go even higher because we have very very potential fat money policies on the market that allows investors to get free basically free cash and therefore stocks is one opportunity to make more out of it on the cost of the US government in the end however you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ojoVbLvtwUI,so this is breaking news let me know what you want to know about this deal make sure to also watch the other video about the Boeing 737 what exactly happened and what I recommended back then you will see that most of it really came true I said by then wait for it check it out how the situation will develop because usually this has always aftermath so there's a big jump then there's maybe it's more jump up of the stock and then goes down and can with bad news because in this scandal like this more management was involved we have seen this in info locks wagon with the diesel scandal this big companies always if something comes up like this have a lot to hide and Boeing had the same obviously some critical management technical managers had some ideas about this critical part of the airplane was not properly functioning and obviously this was disaster for Boeing and the stock,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ojoVbLvtwUI,so maybe it's the right moment to go into the stock I'm for now still waiting a little bit on the sidelines want to see how the new management can move on and then obviously there must be a jump up if really the breaking news the rumors of warren buffett going into boeing will be really really true so let's see how this all develops definitely here on this channel make sure to subscribe and like this video see you tomorrow because i'm vlogging every single day,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
H7JxVfBV9Q4, you know that most of the blockchains have the scalability issue every scale is maybe something you haven't heard about it yet but could be the next big thing the brand new blockchain that you should be aware of Venom Venture fan is a one million dollar fund from Abu Dhabi and they chose to invest you know 5 million into everscale ladies and gentlemen welcome to a new video if you don't know who I am I'm the wolf of Dubai the number one stock market investing YouTuber in the whole Middle East and let me tell you today we are talking about the blockchain in crypto industry okay we are talking about a big big thing that just happens here in the Middle East actually or from the Middle East and that's why I wanted to Deep dive what is going on we will talk about the Venom Venture spun and old which is like a one billion dollars blockchain fund and we will talk about everscale okay and let's dive first into everscale everscale is maybe something you haven't heard about it yet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
H7JxVfBV9Q4,but maybe could be the next big thing the brand new blockchain that you should be aware of okay if I look into interesting project in the crypto industry then I always look into the product Market fit okay and ever scale seems to really build a fundament when you have thousands of community members already and already so much build on top of the blockchain this is very very important okay even when the number you know five million dollars is not you know a huge number as an investment it's actually very interesting because it's a Strategic investment possible so let's dive it you know that most of the blockchains have this scalability issue okay in the web 3 we want to go fast,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
H7JxVfBV9Q4,and we want to go big and that's why every scale developed their own blockchain which is like layout one proof of stake blockchain that is about to solve it has Dynamic multi shredding and sharding technology and the blockchain consists of a master chain and the multitude of work chains which are basically multitudes of charts so the master chain contains all block proofs from the work chains so the security is essentially similar to ethereum or polkadot but unlike other blockchains starting is Dynam let me explain to prevent the slightest congestion a new work chain can be added any time the capacity is fully utilized and this prevents instead congestion okay so this is very very unique here at everscale and I have not seen anything like that before so if this new let's say technology or this new approach you can imagine that very very big whip three projects can be loaded without affecting the processing time or the processing fees and that's why it become one of the most successful in Asia so far blockchains that are used for for example D5 platforms,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
H7JxVfBV9Q4,so we are talking about 65 million transactions already done 195 validators 25 working groups 10 000 active community members and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
H7JxVfBV9Q4,400. thousand users and that is ever scared ladies and gentlemen so now I want to quickly dive into who is the Strategic partner and big investor in everscale because this is important to understand the huge benefit and opportunity that was created here and why it's so important for everscale Venom Venture fund is a 1 billion dollar fund from Abu Dhabi from the United Arab Emirates that was created to support very successful and very promising blockchain problems and they chose to invest you know 5 million into every scale with showing you after due diligence such a big fund invested so much money into everscale and to make it strategic work you know you will have two very good partners working each other to make each others from a Venom Adventures fund obviously has the idea that this 5 million investment will be worth you know 50 and 100 100 million dollars in in value as part as in like an adventure Capital race on the other side every scale will benefit from all of this benefits that such a big player in their blockchain industry can help with contacts help with recruiting people getting the right Network together you know getting the right CEOs for the partnership so there's so many things that can be done together and that's why it's super super interesting that Venom Ventures fund invested here right now just to show you who's behind Venom Ventures fan those are the people like Peter knees who is like the ex cheap investment officer at BlackRock or Mustafa Kariba who is like a very seasonal and well-known middle east investor who knows opportunities when he comes across yourself,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
H7JxVfBV9Q4,okay so now let's talk whatever scale we'll do with the money obviously number one reason when this kind of big Investments happening this is because they should scale their development team okay to build the best product because when you build the product the audience the users the community will come automatically because it's like a network effect like the original ideal blockchain right so build a great product birthday great blockchain and the people will use it they will see the value and will come to the blockchain and use it and create value for the coin and the ecosystem that everscale builds and this is actually you know how you can participate as well obviously always make your own decisions and your own research and this is never Financial advice but have a look on every scale what you can do to participate in it and how you can participate from this kind of deals right so this is number one the second part it's also about the vignon blockchain project where they will use every scale as a layer 2 solution bro so you can see here that they benefit from each other,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
H7JxVfBV9Q4,so you know when Venom will use ever skills technology to scale there and have like a new user case then you know their new project will make every scale more valuable and therefore also the investment for Vino so it's like like a win-win situation that's why I love capitalism because you have always two sides that work together and you know both sides of the end say thank you right so this is the great potential that we can see here with this huge deal that has just been made moreover you know I think and this is maybe the most important part of this video when I look into crypto and blockchain projects I always say say like okay but what is the real case scenario here okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
H7JxVfBV9Q4,what is the real world application here that I will see in a couple of years and we are talking about payment processor we are talking about platforms for CBDs for example so they have so much in the oven that it's so hot right now that I think like this could be one of the projects that we will see that really got a lot of steam and the steam formed like a real great fundament for future growth so have a look uh there's obviously the link into the description make your own research as always let me know what you think about everscale and their future and this partnership and as always don't forget to subscribe and like if you like this kind of updates from the blockchain world from the Wall Street World here on this channel but with the always with the one gold to be greener on the other side and most importantly to be Green in your portfolio so thank you very much for watching and see you tomorrow [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sLwF7MynC9E, hello fellas and how are you doing on your isolation vacation now I'm telling you how my friend here bill Eggman is doing right now he's doing pretty well 2.6 billion dollars well and I'm telling you in this block how exactly he made this money and also let's have a look what he just said in an interview on CNBC every hotel is gonna be shut down in the country everyone hang hang on just one second you say Hilton is going to zero I mean again I'm a major shareholder what I'm saying is if we allow this to continue the way we allow it to continue okay every hotel company in the world okay it's done okay because no business can survive a period of 18 months without revenue okay and that's it it's sick with me and that's what happens okay when if you operate the way we're operating now okay now let me give you so that's a very very bearish thought okay and I've been super bearish but I got bullish okay and the reason why I got bullish and I've been aggressively buying stocks including Hilton today okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
sLwF7MynC9E,and I've been buying all the way down Hilton restaurant brands Starbucks you know walk your way through our purple the only stocks and not buy our companies were on the board and I'm restricted but the reason why is the only answer for the world is to shut the world for 30 days so the guy who just told us that we should shut down everything for one month the whole world basically is making two point six billion dollars in just one month with a capital investment of 27 million dollars now this is a 100 fold and how he did it and who he is all about it here in this block [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sLwF7MynC9E,[Music] so bill ackman the guy with the gray hair and very youngest face is a head fund manager in 2003 he founded Pershing Square Capital which is a hedge fund and he actually you know have about eight billion dollars under management and currently he is all over the news about his critical CNBC interview however he actually went really Fame when he was betting on zero this is a documentary this is how the tide looks on Netflix you should really look into it because it's quite interesting how he made this short and Carl Icahn another billion or make a long call on a company and they in PRS and marketing and interviews on TV made a battle over this company very very interesting make sure to watch this so you know who's Blackmon in other words he's a billionaire that is really known for his active trading and shorting companies and he you know went on CNBC on an very serious interview and what he told on this interview and why it got so many views online let's have a look so recently when he went on CNBC he went live on air via telephone conference and it was so bad that CNPC thought to bring him out of this interview and canceled the interview because they thought he drags down the whole market it was anyway a very bad market day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sLwF7MynC9E,but he went on air and talked about a very series of things so first of all I think partially he is definitely right the only solution is wide very wide and or even global shut down for thirty days to really decrease the spread but the other side he is also saying in something like this could survive companies because if this will drag for a couple of months you know everybody is shutting down after each other this is obviously not a very coordinated move and can inflect the supply chain and also the demand and he said that hotel industry travel industry everyone will go out of business if they don't have revenue for a couple of months obviously nobody have this you know emergency fund we can just see it in the airline industry or other industries that you know they are going bankrupt even though they had lots of money and lots of profit that they used for stock buybacks,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sLwF7MynC9E,and you know in the end of the day you cannot be very aggressive to them or very mad on them because on the end of the day this is something that you a company usually do if they have you know generating cash to buy back stocks is something also what Warren Buffett is recommending also to Apple you know when Steve Jobs called him up and say hey what about with all the cash that Apple has what we should do and Warren Buffett say hey buy back your stocks so this is a very common thing in the investment industry and therefore you cannot be mad about this because you know who knew that a global health situation like this will impact so many industries and us as a humanity so therefore you know this was the interview and what got hundreds of thousands of views when CNBC posted it online I will put the link in the description if you are interested in this 15 minute long interview of Bill Ackman on CNBC but let's now get to the meat to know how he made from 27 million 2.6 billion dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sLwF7MynC9E,okay let's just figure a bit about the numbers so he took 27 million dollars and turned them into two point six billion dollars let's just have a look here so 27 million dollars and two point six billion dollars two point six billion dollars is about two thousand six hundred million dollars so you can see that he actually hundred times the money within one months and how he did it is quite interesting and before we going into the mechanics of the trade it was one trade was one position and he actually turned this gain to his overall hedge fund that made seven point nine percent gain for the overall March months while the S&P lost seventeen percent so he gained almost eight percent and the S&P 500 lost seventeen percent at the same time so this is actually this is why people turn to a hedge funds and this is the word hedge because hedge funds maybe sometimes don't make so much money when the market goes up because they are hedging they are shorting some companies,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sLwF7MynC9E,but you know the beauty about hedge funds is really that when it goes south and it happened every couple of years then hedge funds or good hedge funds really saves money to the very rich people so what he actually purchased was or how he bettered on increase of the corporate bond index s and also he bettered on credit insurance on those corporate bonds because what happened in such a great sell-off is that corporate bonds so the bonds that corporations can issue to gain money for merging acquisitions to investments operations and so on if they need money they can issue this bonds and this long term depth which investors can buy and those went so much down because many people thought that actually companies corporations will go out of business of this crisis and obviously this is a very high fear that was created over there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sLwF7MynC9E,and he said like wait a minute I think the US government will not make the same mistake like they did in 2008 where they fat belly did nothing where we lost Lehman Brothers and the government couldn't figure out to save this Bank which you know collapse actually ended you know into a deeper dive for the whole market and you know he was betting on that and he said the rate on that was so low like almost every low and therefore it's always about the risk and reward and he saw that the risk potential is actually not that big so he had very low risk even in this deal and gained so much money because within one month he gained so much money hundred times the money that he used for this deal I'm sure he is very happy but he's maybe also not that happy that he just put in 27 million dollars when he has over 8 billion in management so I think when he have put 1 billion dollars then he would have now hundred billion dollars however you know winner winner chicken dinner,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sLwF7MynC9E,so that's why I think it was a brilliant move I think this is showing his ability for leading this fund and also after that he actually and he said this also in his interview that he's slowly buying into stocks and he's reducing his short positions very very much and he invests into companies like Hilton for example or he invests in Starbucks and he is betting on America and I think this is you know a very very nice word for the end if you're betting on America it's a very good probability after all this ends that you will get out of this much more wealthier obviously if you got hit by the sell-off now you could gain a little bit more,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sLwF7MynC9E,and maybe we will test the new laws this is what I'm personally thinking and also I saw a couple of experts that are sharing this opinion of me however I think that we have at least we'll have one more opportunity with the same laws we had on the 13th of March or even lower this is actually according to history 70% of the case that can happen now after such a run or really after this bed kept bounds usually this goes in 70% of the cases further down and testing the previous laws or even lower but you know this is just looking into the history what happened before and therefore you know let me know what you want to know in the comments about this deal I think it's just brilliant and sees how many opportunities you have on the stock market and the investment world if you're staying on the right side,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,so welcome to this vlog where we finally go into the discussion stocks or property investing which makes the better return of investment and I'm discussing in my circle of friends and my circular family and in my personal opinion and you will see why I believe that the stocks are gonna beat the property investment and to illustrate all of this I made up a small funny story to go through so make sure to stay tuned and let's roll wolf of Dubai so for the sake of argument let's go and visit the two twin brothers Mike and Joe Mike is more the property type and Joe is the stock type of investor now both for the sake of argument and easy calculation have one hundred thousand dollars cash for investment which they will invest and we will follow them on their journey then we will see in the end of the journey if and how and why who made the better return on investments through its investing so Mike goes out there with his one hundred thousand dollars and he opens most probably a zillow.com or any other property finder company and looked for property that he likes that he thinks is a good investment and want to buy now from this one hundred thousand obviously there are some costs now he will pay approximately five percent broker fee and this and all of this video is average numbers because there's viewers from United States from Europe from Asia and from Canada and all the other countries and regions so this is real average numbers that are really very possible to assume as a general rule of thumb and as calculation purpose so let's say the first five percent goes for the broker then he has to pay 5% for Texas this can also depend but let's say for the sake of calculation we take 5% and then 5% fees which is let's say notary fees or other bigger taxes or other fees debt is going into a purchase of real estate now from this and this is a little bit that's a shocking,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,but actually he cannot invest one hundred thousand dollars but in his property value goes on his eighty five thousand dollars so he actually needful to look for even when he has one hundred thousand in cash he only can look for properties that are valued around eighty five thousand dollars because everything else fifteen percent in total goes on broker taxes and fees now however let's see how this eighty five thousand property investment further develops after the first year so I took an average value increasing number for properties from the 1960s until now worldwide and I came to an average of six point five percent so you can assume that your property every year gains on value on average six point five percent some regions more some regions less,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,some regions have like a spike and then goes down in value so it's similar to a stock market but less volatile now on the other hand you also have assumed that he either save his whole rent because he's he he lives there now or he actually rented out and gets about five percent of the whole value per year for the property now on the other side he has to pay two percent which means for maintenance sometimes we have very less maintenance but some years we have high maintenance and this two percent I also assume management fees like for some properties need to pay for the pool for the securities for the concierge services for some other arrangements you have to also put aside something for the insurance so all of this should be covered as yearly costs two percent for the property,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,"so we come to an all and all gain of 9.5% which is a new value of the property of ninety three thousand seventy five so this is actually not that he has this on his bank account but actually can assume approximately the value deducting by the cost that he had that what he you know actually spent and what is his net worth of this property and if you're considering this this is six thousand nine hundred twenty-five dollars less then his initial investment and therefore in the first year Mike loses about seven percent on his money because obviously the fifteen percent in the very beginning a very high initial cost when he buys into the property and then this other gain takes a little bit of time so next year he breaks even but we will come later on in the full of calculation on long term ten years so if you like this kind of videos make sure to smash that like button and also subscribe to this channel because we are talking daily about stocks and investment so let's see what Joe is doing with his stock investing so Joe takes also $100,000 in cash nobody asked where he has it maybe hazard from his grandma or he earned it or he saved it we don't know but he same as his twin brother Mike has this 100k now for sake of argument because you know there's a lot of brokerage out there and as you know from my yesterday video if you should check it out it's a stock market video for beginners so interesting how to gain every year ten percent on average without doing nothing so actually if you are knowing what the broker is you put their money there and invest into a stock market index ETF and leave your money there so most of these trades are totally without any charges so that means that if he puts a hundred and dollars into his portfolio he has $100,000 to buy stocks so let's assume he bought like an ETF like I recommended yesterday which she don't have to do anything",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,and it's a basket of the best 500 companies in the US on the US economy the strongest economy in the world now on average then you are gaining with his value about 10% now to this 10% gain which is an average like for example last year on the stock market we had 30% maybe this year we will have 10% 20% we don't know but after great year usually for us a good year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,"so we should be fine with that but on average also with crisis with world wars and everything negative we on average had 10% return on the stock market if you invested in an ETF now you can see here the next point that is even in addition to that is 2% dividend so this is an total 12 percent that you gain directly on your money in cash and I put to be fair a little bit of trade fees or management fees or whatsoever if you're investing for example and the ETF at 0.03 percent of $3 on $10,000 so it's basically nothing but for fairness if you trade a bit then I put 0.5% of you paying more than that then definitely don't trade or change to poker so in the end of the year he has 111 500 dollars on his account in cash guys this is a real return of investment of 11.5 percent and you see now where I'm going with now compared to the rental property investment they were minus 7 we are plus 11.5",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,so we are out performing the rental with more than 18 percent so this is ridiculous in the first year you are way better as the rental property the enema have much less work to do okay so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,"and this is actually my main argument and we come later on to some details but if you're investing in stocks you actually just buy it and go sleep for ten years you know that that would be the very best things for you to do and if we are diving further into the calculations you will see how it further developed after ten years because this is important now if you're buying a property or buying stocks you always have to think long term because this yearly up and downs or weekly or daily up and down just will make you crazy this is the same as somebody would come everyday to your house and would say hey your house is valued 2% less today do you want to sell or you want to buy do you want to sell tomorrow it is now today minus 5% so you know it would make you crazy and that's why stocks can be easily psychology a little bit hard on you if you see the stock and look at it every few hours what's once the stock is going so just forget about it like you would buy a property and just don't think about it now let's have a look under the calculation so as we saw Mike who invest $100,000 had the value of a net value of $85,000 and had a year-over-year value increase",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,"and you know rent increase and a rent income of total nine point five percent so this is what we assumed for the next ten years the same of Joe Joe had 100,000 and his net value is hundred it stays 100,000 and in the year-over-year increase we are seeing or we will assume 11.5% now as you can see the Mike portfolio grows in the second year actually topped our break-even with 100 on almost $2,000 and then we see at year 10 he is at $210,000 so he more than doubled his investment investing into property and he may be live in it or maybe he rented I calculated 5% per year so you can see all of this is considered now let's have a look on how Joe is doing so Joe is actually already very much ahead 11.5% he made in the first year and you can see he doubled already in the seventh year and he almost tripled in the tenth year so you can see there is a difference of 90,000 dollars between those two",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,and I can say that there is much less work to do for Joe definitely here and there's some more let's say Pro or cons when speaking about property investing versus stock market investing which I just want to go into you with you so let's say let's talk about emergency sale so if you want to sell your property on emergency you need the money you need the funds then you can surely attempt to go with the price 10 or 15% less that you actually want which is very bad for your net assets on the other hand side stocks in one second you can sell all your stocks and actually have exactly what they are worth and most of the time or let's say it's then depending on the market if you at this moment has some gains or some losses and there is definitely the factor of volatility now if volatility actually means that how volatile is and I totally agree with you the stock market is can be totally crazy and this is what many people are scared of they say hey you okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,I can lose twenty thirty forty percent of my value of my net investment and this is true yes,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,but if you go into indexes even in the worst worldwide financial crisis in 2007 we lost 50 percent and then it went up again so don't worry about it and be a little bit more relaxed and what are we talking about loans because loans are something that you know if you're buying properties most of the time it's with loans but you have to be fair because you could also buy stocks with loans and still have the bet return of investment and the leveraged investment so actually you know it's it's both the same though loans can be a little bit more easier when secured with an asset like a property obviously now own time now I can assure you that your time will be needed when you're going into a property now because you are having all this notary and paperwork's and you have to take care about tenants and you have to maintenance things and you know it will take time and that's where you have to account for this as well now capital requirements this is a negative for the property investment as well because you definitely need more starting capital for property I assume you know the minimum down payment for a property depending on the property obviously,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,but I think like ten thousand fifteen thousand five thousand dollars is like minimum and on the stock market you can buy a share for even one dollar and last but not least obviously as a small disclaimer I want to also mention that maybe some people would say hey do you forget a lot of things I wanted just to simplify this maybe you have more taxes in your country maybe less maybe you have their more return maybe they're less so especially property market is so different regionally worldwide that you cannot you know separate it in a video except you want to watch me for like 50 60 minutes in a row,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,and I want to save you from that so make sure to smash up the like button if you like this video but this are very important points because I didn't account or I didn't want it to include because it make all just more complicated is you have to consider there's also inflation though inflation that the money gets less valued it's the same for both so actually it doesn't really matter in this opportunity then you have to obviously consider also for the long cost or interests both also the same like property as I mentioned earlier are usually financed by a loan or a credit so this is more into the property side there rent in and the rent saving so you have also to consider that you know under if you let's say invest into stocks and pay less rent and mortgage than there's like a saving so I didn't account for that as well on the other side you know maybe you get a little bit more rent,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,so you know I try to be as fair as possible so you have to also consider that if you reinvest your capital or your rent into the property this makes more interest as more money heavier more percentage right as I'm making every single year which is the beauty of compound interest the next point is also very important if you sell after you you know lifted it or used it or you won some gains on the stock market you sell it there's most in most countries some sales tax or capital increase in attacks so obviously this I didn't account it yet because you know I didn't sold it in this story but you have seen or you have to account for this obviously as well that you know if you make some gains if you make some profit then you have to pay taxes on that as well and last but not least I want to mention it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
QWcnLw3pVdQ,but it's more into the property side that lots of people are investing also in properties in renovations so they actually put let's say ten thousand dollars and that will increase the property price by fifteen thousand dollars this is obviously very common into the property market investing but for reasons that I didn't want to make it too complicated I didn't wanted to put it in this calculation because on the other hand side you can also buy more stocks and gain more on this stocks as well so I wanted to keep it as simple as possible so see you tomorrow [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

IICdGHn9tSo,Biden and McCarthy they reached a handshake deal on the debt ceiling both parties are claiming success while many in both parties are saying they got nothing out of it carthy came out to tell the American people that this was transformational while Jeffries said it was an incredibly significant step towards protecting Social Security here's the bottom line the government's in gridlock Republicans control the house Democrats control the Senate so they have to compromise Wall Street thinks this is a good thing because they do not want any one party to Rule the Day president has to sell it to the Democrats and McCarthy has to sell to the Republicans to get a place of agreement there's a ton of reasons why members in both parties would not sign and would not agree because largely in my view after looking at the agreement there was really very minor concessions made on all sides no somebody was getting a lot out of the deal it kind of was business as usual in Washington but here's the timeline that we're gonna watch it gets kicked off on Wednesday the house is going to vote and then it's gonna go if it passes there to the Senate and those guys will have four days to get it passed if they sign it in that four day period it's then going to get rushed over to the president who's going to sign it into law if everything went perfectly that would give us the date of June 5th which would be next Monday for a resolution to the debt ceiling crisis we already know though that Janet Yellen has been out sounding the alarms that the U.S government will absolutely run out of cash early June and if we were to default she has said many times that it would cause severe damage to financial institutions as well as the general economy and on that note a recent analytics report said that a brief debt ceiling breach would slash 1.5 million jobs wow raising unemployment from 3 point four percent to five percent my first thought on that is well that would make the FED happy his goal is to get unemployment up to begin to put pressure on inflation and that would immediately solve that concern so you really never know what the powers that be may do in this situation and we also got a report from Goldman Sachs they predicted that the treasury will run low on cash by June 8th or 9th unless the debt ceiling limit was raised this basically means that the government is just barely screeching across the finish line to get this whole thing resolved now I have to play this clip by Warren Buffett on balancing the U.S budget because in my view it is timeless classic war and wisdom and it's spot on so check this out these problems aren't been mature enough for a president that's been mature enough to take this head off,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

IICdGHn9tSo,all tech companies in the AI space are going up so let's disregard the fundamentals for a moment and consider if the price action in the charts shows us something that the fundamentals do not C3 was officially coming out of being oversold on the RSI in March of 2022 it broke out of the bear Zone which is the point of 50 percent and below in the RSI January of 2023 and this has been vacillating in the bull Zone ever since it's yet though to push into overbought territory which causes me to believe that there is an opportunity left in this move to go higher that's from a technical point of view when C3 broke above 26.50 that was the trigger price I always give you guys that trigger price that if you're above it's bull territory if you're below it's bear territory and ever since then it's been moving up now if we got a break above 34.99 I think the target becomes 41 to 43 dollars in my view it's a simple clear place to place your stop loss at 31 bucks decently beneath the current price right above that critical area of support around 26 dollars support is at 28 25 and 22.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

yz4DYxbfHmk,and so while we're we're trading why Josh is giving you guys the hot plays let's concentrate on what stock are we going to have 5 7 10 and even 15 years from now and believe it or not some of these stock will literally have ridiculous multiples over time and one of the things Larry that I loved about his story was that moment in time in which he got all excited about being an investor because I know that a lot of you guys have taken extremely hard earned money that you really can't you know it really is questionable whether it should be sacrificed for investment and maybe not right things for your family right and you've taken that money and you've invested it with hopes and expectations only to see someone like in this case the CEO commits suicide yeah and certain you know and we've seen companies Larry where the CEO just quits and walks away just walks away excuse me go ahead and at that moment we get I bet you were like kind of disgusted oh yeah the hope the last time I'm gonna ever invest in anything yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yz4DYxbfHmk,and the truth is Larry let's let's examine this for a minute the truth is that if you had been able to somehow see past that moment and you had doubled down and hustled a little bit and mowed a few more Lawns over in Finland or raked a few more leaves I don't know what's going on over there and put in another 500 the opportunity was incredible but can I yes sir put a big butt in the room there's always big buttons but at that time doubling down was not the right thing to do right because bad things fundamentals did not indicate the fundamentals did not end but he did hold so I'm gonna be controversial and you know call out a crypto let's say Matic right let's let's go let's deal with it this is your show so you guys know that you don't understand okay Matt you know you could do Solana but I want to do magic you do Solana I'll do magic all right good,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yz4DYxbfHmk,so so when I get back in uh and he and I have talked about it I know you made we went to lunch or breakfast this morning and had a lengthy conversation about these things and I literally said that when I get back into crypto my biggest Position will be magic yep because as you guys know I like to be in the fastest moving car now you know I know it's down excuse me I gotta drink this go ahead well I'm only gonna say that when it comes to making these types of moves from one crypto to the other I want people to feel or stuck or stock I don't want you to sometimes the solution is to unload a position right take that money and put it into a different story yeah now if you unload that position and then you think I'll wait for something to happen down the road to get back in right then you really may be locking in a loss yes okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yz4DYxbfHmk,but if you take that position and you transfer it to a faster moving company that may be the best thing you could do I'm glad you said that because I did sell some crypto and move it over to and I talked about it to Matic and actually Matic actually went up after I did that so what I'm saying is I still have somatic and I'm not I'm just going to wait and I'm going to wait it out because I feel safer holding somatic right I don't have anything on any platforms remember like I told you guys on your keys on your crypto but I plan on buying more when the tree gets through shaking for those of you that are in the midwest it's fall you see the leaves are changing colors and they're they're just falling that's what's happening in crypto that video you played on Kevin O'Leary wow you knocked the ball right out of the park he what he said was absolutely true and when all of this is over down the road I believe that especially in crypto there will be a lot of stories like this,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

r-epU06B2eY, hey there youtube family it's stocks with josh hit the like for me say hi in the comments section it was sort of a slow day for me in the market i didn't do a lot of trading i did though drop a bag on one of our small cap stocks s bet s-b-e- t,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,i like the fact that despite all the cell pressure that we've seen in the market over the last couple days that it's still above its moving averages which was bullish to me and i decided to increase my position there i took some profits on my sqq trade for some very specific reasons i'm going to discuss those with you i was able to cash out of that with a 21 profit uh and what i saw on the day was a long-legged doji candle that is a candle with a very small body very tall wick and a very long tail and what it often means is indecision what i would have needed to see for me to keep my sqq would have been just a great big green candle that started the day off and finished the day off uh and it would have been pointing and with no wick on top that would have told me keep it uh,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,but we had a day of indecision and it gave me the indication that i would like to sell see if i get a pullback i'm by no means done with the sqq because i believe the markets are going to continue to be choppy i believe there's absolutely risk to the downside i just want to see if i can get a better price on it as it pulls back,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
r-epU06B2eY,and i saw an opportunity to take some profits and it's never wrong to take some profits let's check out the heat maps the stocks today were absolutely mixed tech was the worst performer of the S&P500 and the energy and utility sectors were pretty much in the green 3m and salesforce were the dogs bringing the market down they were the laggards and the dow while walmart and chevron were outperforming the rest in crypto the markets were relatively green eath eath classic and uniswap were some of the big winners i had kind of picked on eth the day before saying they doubled down on going down well they have doubled down on going up today which was nice to see and the dollar the dollar gave me the same candle that the sqq gave and if you follow my channel i reference the sqq and the dollar as sort of indicators for me to get a good sense of what's happening with the rest of the market the dollar also gave me a into a long-legged dog g candle small body tall wick long tail and it basically meant that the bulls and bears fought all day long with some pretty decent volume neither one of them won it ended the day at a draw so i wanted to talk with you guys briefly about the skills play that i brought to the table about a week ago so when i brought this play to the family it was simply because of the squeeze trades that we had been seeing in the market we were we were at a market that was peaking,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,and we had a lot of companies that were just way over shorted we had bynd beyond meat we had laser luminar technologies lazr amc and of course the big boy of them all bbby bed bath and beyond those short squeezes were crazy profitable they came out of nowhere and they just caused the stocks to go screaming up and so i was looking for other companies that could possibly squeeze and i felt the skills might have had the opportunity to have squeezed right it had a beautiful consolidation period and it had some momentum build up and in addition to that it was cheap i knew a lot of people could afford it they could afford to take a position in that could actually make a big difference some of these other companies they're 20 a share a lot of you may not have been able to get a thousand shares and really see the value of the short squeeze but a lot of people could afford to maybe get a thousand shares of skills,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,and so i thought you know what let's give this one a shot so on august 17th i mentioned it when it was a dollar 75 and i said that we had a target price of selling it around 3.65 cents to four dollars and that i was setting my stop loss at a dollar sixty-five so in a moment i'm going to review the charts but before i do i just want to point out uh that we're in their final days of the really ideal offer from mumu which is offering 13 stocks for opening up and fully funding an account but the real deal lies in just putting in a hundred dollars where you get their best offer to date which is 10 free stock each of those stocks could range from three dollars to over two thousand dollars you spin a dial and so even if you were just to get one at two thousand dollars that would be an incredible game changer for a lot of people to begin to have a new account with two thousand fresh dollars to invest that'd be a lot of fun,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,all right we're going to basically go over skills sklz one of the first things i want to point out to you guys is we know this became very bearish when the 100-day moving average eventually broke beneath the 200-day moving average that is a very bullish move and you can see that the stock responded accordingly with a massive move down and when these begin to fan out that's also indicating to you that the bearish trend is going to continue these fanned out and they remained fanned out for a long time allowing sklz to just continue to fall look how fanned out that is right but now right around here and this is what drew my attention to the stock and specifically all the short squeezes we were seeing and i knew that that skills had a very very high short interest because there was a lot of negativity surrounding the stock there was because of this consolidation right here this period of sideways movement i thought you know this might be a decent risk scenario to look at taking a small cap dollar fifty stock at the time it was a dollar seventy five for a one hundred percent move up if we got some sort of a short squeeze that would shoot us up and test for the first time this uh 200-day moving average,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,right that's what we were hoping to see but what i gave you guys was the um stop-loss of a dollar uh 65.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,i gave that to you guys because we were in at 1.75 right and the stop loss at a dollar 65 would be right at this 15 ema now when this stock broke up tried to break above the ema it got rejected right it stayed below and went lower but when it eventually moved and broke above that's when we got this larger move so when it's above its moving average that's typically when it's going to have a bullish trend so we set it right at that moving average because we know that if it goes beneath the 15 ema we could see an extension of a downward trend we just didn't want to participate in that we were willing to take our small eight percent loss and uh just walk away right because if we broke beneath this this 15 ema the likelihood of a short squeeze would just really be greatly diminished and probably not happen but the reason why we were willing to take risk on this stock is because of this period of consolidation in addition to that this bullish divergence on the rsi bullish divergence because the stock was moving down and sideways but the rsi which this represents selling and buying momentum this selling momentum is everything beneath the 50 the middle point here is the 50.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,this is the 70 percent and this is the 30 percent okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,so when it's down here the bears uh have control of it but back here was the turning point right when it hit this low that's when they had the most selling pressure but even though the stock continued to go down and sideways the selling pressure has consistently diminished okay which means that the the bearers are slowly closing their positions and the bulls are slowly beginning to take positions right we're getting very close to this point in time that if we had a nice solid move above the 50 we could begin to get that larger break back up into the overbought territory which would have happened if we had some form of a short squeeze so the consolidation here the bullish divergence on the rsi those were the main reasons we got in but the main point of this video is risk prevention if once it broke that 15 ema there was no point in holding it because the move down could absolutely go to 80 cents and you would lose 50 percent of your total position so if you dropped 2 000 on this you would lose a full thousand dollars it's just not worth it because we can just jump right back in if we get that momentum that continues to build like we hope and it breaks back above the 15 ema and the 100 day then we'd be like you know what it's time to get back in stop trying to catch those the bottom stop trying to be the guy that buys perfectly at the bottom you're never going to be that guy i'm not that guy you know let's use the charts to trade uh we will consider buying back into this if we get the break above the 15 and the 100 day ema for the move that would exist here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,okay but when you get below those moving averages you put yourself exposed to upwards to a 50 risk here i don't want you guys to lose any money so i'm taking the time to caution you and explain this trade a little bit deeper hopefully that helped so i don't know if you guys have ever heard the number one rule in investing and this is the number one rule it's to cut your losses and let your winners run and i traded for quite a while before i understood the value of that the number one reason that i did not use stop losses for the longest time is that i just couldn't stand the idea of losing eight percent per trade and if i made a bad trade after a bad trade after a bad trade i felt like man these losses are just going to add up and it's going to whittle away the little bit of money that i'm investing and so it was very discouraging,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,so i didn't see it as an advantage but the bottom line is is that when i began to manage my risk then that's when i began to make consistent money you guys have heard me say it on this page before the goal of the page is to make consistent profits the bottom line is you want to take your losses before they get worse and it's it's always the best strategy and i try my best to to get my book of disciplines out and write in there the story of what happened and what i learned so i'm going to strongly advise you guys to consider taking losses and to use stop losses especially on your swing trades successful investors accept this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r-epU06B2eY,and they try to minimize their losses rather than avoid them selling a stock at a loss you can basically get a tax credit which is good and selling the losers has another big advantage you're not going to be reminded of your past mistakes every time you look at your exchange there is a lot of psychology to sort through when investing investing will reveal fear procrastination greed depression every emotion in the book staring at a loss rather than cutting it can be the biggest mistake but don't be rash before you liquidate a bad portfolio leave it as is and come up with a trade that you have higher confidence in start off with the new discipline of putting in an 8 stop loss from this point forward all right then hit that subscribe and the notification bell if you enjoyed this video and let me know family if you guys bought anything today uh and if you handled skills differently than i mentioned in the video if you bought it and are holding it or if you bought it and let the stop-loss kick in or if you think it's something that you might get back into i will probably bring it up because i'm going to keep an eye on it for us all as always peace and blessings my friends i look forward to seeing you in the next video take care,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NwjvubapZ54, I talk to them about being like a group of junkies who relapsed on listen man I just needed some liquidity you know what I'm saying I just ran into some bad subprime you know we just had complex formulas we just didn't factor in greed and panic you know I just need 805 billion dollars by Tuesday yeah no seriously no I would not screw you again it's pretty cool I've learned my lesson I know I mean this is not like the other time this oh no these are no seriously I just just try talking about here man just give me help me out just give me a little bit yeah just a taste that's all I need is a taste this I need 2.5 trillion dollars I'll pay you back,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NwjvubapZ54,Hey There YouTube family Robin Williams absolutely nailed that commentary and that humorous criticism of the banking industry and the politicians that are always there to keep them served with that money crack stimulus that they're always coming back looking for hey give me another 2.5 trillion just to get me through the day Robin Williams man you you were saying hysterical anyways what really got me triggered this weekend was a commentary by Janet Yellen she came out again yet again and repeated her stance that the banking industry is really stabilizing after a tumultuous March treasury Chief repeated that the government will act again if needed and if there's one thing that I've learned about Yellen is that when she comes out and tells you everything is okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NwjvubapZ54,it is a hundred percent that it is absolutely not okay when she comes out and says it's all good you want to know it's all bad and that we're getting closer and closer to a potential breakdown she was asked didn't you guys miss it didn't you guys miss the fact that this fast exponential raising of rates was going to cause serious problem to the bond portfolios increase the risk of the banks exponentially and cause a major collapse or a credit crunch in the days ahead and she said no no we didn't do that we didn't make that mistake at all well they absolutely made that mistake the banks knew it everybody knew it since 2022 every single month of 2022 when the Fed was raising rates the bond portfolios were collapsing this was not a surprise the question that was had was how bad was each Bank off how bad was each Bank being managed nobody per se would have known that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NwjvubapZ54,but they would have known that they were all in trouble and so she's just yet again making the rounds in my mind she's making rounds and sending out a warning for those who have the right ears to hear let's go over some of the things that we know for sure we know that 60 percent of all the loans that are given to small businesses are given by small Regional Banks so that's a lot of liquidity that goes from the regional Banks to the small businesses now if you didn't know it small businesses make up over 99 percent of all of the businesses in the US so if the small Banks provide loans to small businesses and they can no longer provide those loans because they don't have the money and the government's not going to bail them out they're only going to bail out the big Banks if the small Banks do not get the money it doesn't go to the small businesses they don't have the ability to hire they don't have the ability to take on new jobs and to grow their business and so it's going to have a massive impact on employment through the small businesses because the small businesses in America employ 50 percent of everyone that's employed in the U.S and so we know for a fact because of those basic things I just gave you that we absolutely have a coming credit crisis,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NwjvubapZ54,and I think everybody knows it Janet Yellen knows that the FED knows it Biden knows that everybody knows that we've got a humming credit crunch through the small Banks and there's really nothing they can do about it they're going to prop up the banks that are too big to fail and the small banks are going to begin to fall like dominoes you see that by looking at the spdr the s p Regional banking ETF it hasn't bounced after a 30 percent drop it's still down at the floor everybody knows that these guys are in trouble and they're not the smart money is not going to pile back into that until all the problem gets washed out I want you guys to keep in mind that svb had 20 billion dollars less than 20 billions it was closer to 16 billion they had less than 20 billion in potential losses in their bond portfolio it is understood right now that the banking industry collectively has 620 billion dollars of bond losses and so the svb was truly just the tip of the iceberg there's a much bigger problem beneath but why have the markets been climbing all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

NwjvubapZ54,okay today we got the joltz data and that didn't have very much of a big impact on the market I'm going to analyze why that was but what it specifically happened is that we saw that job openings tumbled below 10 million in February this was the very first time time that we've seen this decrease in the last two years and so this really should have been good news if the old narrative that bad news is good news because it could move the FED is still in place but has that changed is this the first signal now today that bad news is going to begin to be bad news because the fear has gone from the FED to potentially recession and deflation because that's what this would signal the labor market beginning to soften up would signal that we're having a problem we're going to see more layoffs those layoffs are going to lead to less spending and the less spending is going to directly impact every single American Business and their earnings they want to see margins increase they want to see debt decrease they want to see companies moving up and doing better and whenever you're moving into a recessionary environment there's simply no room for stocks to go up because stocks only go up when the profit margin and the companies grow not when companies are going to begin to lose value because they're facing a recession and so the jolts data might have been an early signal that we're moving into a time when bad data is going to mean a bad effect on stocks and stock value we also saw the first sign of layoffs outside of big Tech Donalds is preparing for layoffs this is now the service sector which shows that the impact of a potential recession is beginning to take root in more Industries than just big Tech the news article read that McDonald's closes Corporate Offices as workers await layoffs so even though we're continuing to get more bad data overall for the last couple weeks the markets have been climbing why have the markets been climbing well the big answer is that the market believes that the FED is positioned to go back to pumping liquidity into Banks to prevent a massive banking crisis in addition to that the market is taking notice of the fact that Japan and China I have already these are very large economies that are already pumping liquidity back into the global economy which absolutely impacts American companies so you've got the three largest economies on Earth pumping liquidity M2 money supply is turning up from its cycle lows and between the fact that we've got the M2 money supply increasing and we've got these three groups the U.S economy Japan and China pumping potentially with the us but Japan and China doing it right now pumping liquidity back in the system the more money that goes back in the system the better stocks are going to do but the reason why we saw the market run all the way up to 4 200 on the S&P500 and then stall out is that the truth is we don't have enough data we don't know if the next Corner we turn we're going to see a massive banking collapse we don't know whether we're going to see a ton of more bad deflation data or we begin to see when the next round of earnings come out positive earnings reports from all the companies the the stock market is very likely going to move sideways until we get the data that we need and one of the data points that that is ahead of us in the month of April April 27th is going to be quarter one GDP that's going to tell everybody whether the economy is dramatically slowing down that would be a big bad news event and if on that event you see that stocks are falling then we're going to know for certain that the smart money now believes that the biggest risk to the value of stocks is not the FED but rather the coming recession and deflation and that's where you could begin to see the bigger move down that 30 percent that 50 percent potential move down but until we get to that data I think we're going to continue to move sideways and even possibly higher I think that there's as I said in the last three videos and some of the big tech companies that I cover there's just a little bit more room to to the upside I think we're going to hit those key technical levels and then I think we're likely going to sell off that's all I've got for you guys today I'm thinking of doing a lightning round on a bunch of stocks tomorrow so in the comment section let me know the stock that you would most like me to cover again if I don't cover your favorite stock you can always come find me in the chat group over on MooMoo and ask me directly,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

EuPed8AwvnI,foreign [Music] May and go away guys I've been telling you for quite a while stocks are getting frothy and even if we get through the month of May June ahead of us is actually one of the months with the lowest statistical average of ending higher than where it began so we've got May and June ahead of us the markets have been getting frothy big Tech's been pushing all the way to the very top of the range we've got to ask ourselves the question is it best to get out right now the big Tech stock names they're the ones that have been pumping the markets higher and we as I said in my other video it's just a handful of companies Apple Microsoft Amazon alphabet Facebook and Tesla these guys as a group make up half of the NASDAQ and 22 percent of the S&P500 now because they make up such a big part of the NASDAQ the NASDAQ has outperformed the s p significantly in the last 11 years if you had been in the NASDAQ 11 years ago your account would be up 500 percent the s p would only be up 200 percent in the last 11 years and big Tech played a big role in getting the s p up to 200 percent but out of all of them Apple has the biggest market cap it makes up 12 of the NASDAQ and so if we're going to talk about the NASDAQ going up this week we got to talk about Apple and as I've said this week Thursday Apple's reporting earnings and apple is absolutely right now technically pushing up to the very tippy top of its resistance at 170 bucks but because it actually closed above its descending resistance line it opened up the door for it to go higher 175 177,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EuPed8AwvnI,maybe but we want to take a step back and ask ourselves man is it worth putting any money right now on Apple should we buy an Apple calls going into earnings is there opportunity to the upside yes is there more risk to the downside probably yes let's take a step back and talk about where Apple stock has come from and where it could possibly go Apple stock it reached a milestone market cap of 3 trillion dollars when it hit an all-time high price of 183 bucks after that along with everything else it pulled back,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
EuPed8AwvnI,and it came all the way down to 125 bucks at the beginning of this year in early January and ever since then it's been quickly climbing and moving back to that potential three trillion dollar market cap Apple's number one product is the iPhone and since they launched it it's actually caused the stock to go up 5 800 percent and an absolute incredible number and a very reasonable question for all of us to ask is how much further is this thing going to go now this is not going to be a bash Apple stock video matter of fact most retail Traders would actually do really well to start investing in successful proven large cap stocks like apple,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
EuPed8AwvnI,but I think it's very important for us to look at both sides of the story or maybe both sides of the coin I want us to consider the macro Market moment that we're in as well can you check my bank balance and let me know which Apple product can I afford apple juice and that's the other big subject that we're going to cover today and we're going to ask ourselves in this environment can apple go up this is the stocks with Josh show thank you guys for hitting the like subscribe if you want to get these daily timely stocking crypto insights charting and the predictions that I make but don't fall for the scammers in the comments section these guys use my name and my picture they get back to you guys faster than I can it's not me there's a new offer of the MooMoo Investment app if you need better trade tools for the month of May they're offering up to 20 free stocks nine for opening and funding your account with a minimum deposit of a hundred bucks this is a limited time an exclusive offer for the month of May you can click on the link in the top pin comments that's going to give you all the details and a picture of what you can get now I specifically use MooMoo and what I like about it is the earnings calendar I find it super easy to follow all the upcoming earnings once the earnings are posted basically you can come back and click on that Tab,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

EuPed8AwvnI,all right let's get into apple I want to take a minute to talk about Apple as a growth stock because that's really what is that question here is because the number one factor that causes a stock to go up in value is ultimately growth the second is increasing or growing the profit margin we've seen Tesla and some other companies hit hard beat down because they didn't protect the profit margin and the other one is growth so what is actually a growth stock well traditionally a growth stock has some basic characteristics number one growth means that a company has substantial room keyword substantial room for capital appreciation and it often tends to be a smaller cap company we basically know that apple is the largest market cap in the world so there really is no substantial room them for them to appreciate in value and then the number two Factor growth companies tend to be pre-positive cash flow or even have negative earnings on that note Apple's annual free cash flow for 2022 was 111 billion dollars which was near 20 increase from their 2021 cash flow,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EuPed8AwvnI,so yes big cap companies can still be in a growth phase but here's the question I wanted to draw out from these points at what point does it become obvious that they're more likely to be slowing down now let's take a minute and consider the p e which is the price to earnings ultimately a high PE means that it is either seen as a growth stock or it's simply overvalued what is Apple's PE right now it's 29 and what is its price to sales well that's seven I want to take a look back at the history of Apple's PE when it had a much smaller market cap its PE for many years was under 15 that's when all of the opportunity D to the upside of those new iPhones was still being imagined as it rolled out throughout the world that 15pe is what led to It ultimately ramping up in price and hitting that 3 trillion market cap,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EuPed8AwvnI,so what should the PE be if there's room for Apple to reach 4 trillion if you're Mega bullish on Apple I would love for you to tell me I've got more questions that I've got answers on this particular one what do you think the PE should be right now that would justify Apple getting up to a four trillion dollar market cap and I also want to examine with you guys how Apple's PE has behaved in other market pullbacks like 2015 and 2017.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EuPed8AwvnI,at that time it dropped around 25 percent now in addition to that the stock price has also dropped between 25 to 35 percent many many times if that happened again right now in this macro environment which we're going to get to in a minute Apple would be between 125 and 110 dollars now if Apple happens to be in a classic distribution phase one 10 would be the beginning of the decline phase With It ultimately reaching 80 to 60 dollars as the ultimate outcome I am not predicting that but what I am asking is does it make sense to take profits at this current elevated level by at least using a trailing stop loss so if you get stop loss out you would be capturing some of the amazing gains that massive run-up that's been seen over the last decade you either are going to capture some of those gains or you're going to imagine that this thing is going to run for another decade taking Apple from a three trillion dollar market cap to a four or six trillion dollar market cap that's the question that you have to answer to be in Apple at this price and so to really get to the bottom of whether or not Apple can grow to become a four trillion dollar market cap company I think we've got to answer what is the macro moment that we're in will this macro environment allow for Apple to achieve those goals which today it very very much includes the conversation of the banking crisis JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie dimon said today that this seizure of First Republic puts at rest the excruciating period of panic for the banking system this part of the crisis is over he told analysts on his Monday conference call Jamie comes out,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EuPed8AwvnI,and he's like guys it's over there's nothing to see here everything is fine just move along go about your business buy something invest something don't worry we've got this when questioned about the fact that big Banks were becoming bigger and that power was being Consolidated into even fewer hands Diamond forcefully rejected such a concern but let's kind of go over to another article and check out their point of view there is actually an existing rule preventing any Bank like JP Morgan from making an acquisition providing it with more than 10 percent of all U.S deposits JP Morgan is already above that cap so they're already above the 10 percent but Regulators waived those deposit concentration restrictions and basically blessed the deal anyways the bottom line is that diamond stepped up he cut a deal with the government he was given special privileges making him above the established regulations on banking size and now he's out working the circuit for our sake working for the government trying to calm mine and yours fears well nothing has changed in the banking sector if you understand what brought these Banks down the fact is that unrealized losses on long-term bonds purchased during a period of ultra low interest rates is basically a problem that's shared by every financial institution every single Bank in the entire world we looked at Jamie diamonds Banks and saw that they had a massive unrealized loss and there's a lot of people in the media that are trying to compare this current situation to the 2008 banking crisis and they're completely different the banking crisis from 2008 was based on sketchy high-risk Bank decisions in an ultra low regulatory environment but the problem that we're facing now is that this time the banks actually played it safe but it still backfired on them the current crisis is built on U.S treasuries which are considered very safe and long-term mortgages which are also considered relatively safe that have lost tremendous value you do to a transition from a no rate or low rate to a high rate environment the rate increases of the past year mark the first time in history that the central bank had basically tightened monetary policy while the banking system was flooded with excess cash so this is not a bridge that we've crossed before and nobody nobody in the government not Jamie dimon knows how to solve it or what the outcome is ultimately going to be and on another note a different voice in Wall Street chimed in today on the banking problems and that was Charlie Munger who I believe is actually telling the truth now he said banks are full of bad loans on commercial property he went on to say in good times we get into bad habits when the bad times come they the banks lose too much money Charlie is 99 years old man this guy's got a lot of insight and he has nothing left to gain or lose and in my view he's the one that's telling us the straight truth and I personally believe him of course the banks are in trouble the fact is the bank in Christ has actually barely started it's going to be followed by a credit crunch businesses are suddenly not going to be able to roll over their loans or borrow any money and that is going to throw the economy into Panic as everyone who owns a business is going to be scrambling to find some cash just to survive we're not talking about growing we're talking about surviving and we've also seen in retail credit it hitting new highs which is also going to feed into more of a credit crisis and that brings us back to Apple where is all the easy money going to come from that's going to push Apple stock to four trillion dollars that's the question I'm laying to you guys today I don't have the answer to that I'm needing you guys to tell me and in conclusion I've been asked a lot about two different plays I've been asked about Apple calls or buying the sqq and as I've said regarding the Apple calls the only way that you would consider buying Apple calls going into this earnings if you can sit there and you can watch it you need to be able to cut that loose immediately if it begins ends to go against you you've got to be very attentive to that particular play I personally lean towards getting into swing trades that last a little bit longer ones that I can enter and leave in a couple days a couple weeks or even a couple months you guys know I've been patiently waiting on the sqq but timing is still of essence it did reach my target which is I gave everybody when this thing was in the 30s I said guys my Buy Signal is 28 and now we've gotten to that place and I have entered a small position my purpose in entering a small position is because that allows me to put more focus and energy on that particular trade but we need to also keep in mind that Apple can push the NASDAQ higher if Apple comes out and kills it it will cause all of big Tech to go higher which would absolutely cause the sqq to break down and it could go anywhere from 28 dollars to ultimately twenty dollars and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EuPed8AwvnI,so yes if you're in at twenty eight dollars don't get panicked okay you've gotta you've got to think think through your trades but this is why I said in my other video Let's see what Apple does if you got in at 28 and this market trends down and then Apple gives its earnings and they're not good and it goes even further well you would have gotten in early and it will work out well for you personally I'm looking for a little bit more confirmation as to what's going to happen with apple once I know that then I think it's going to be an ideal time for me to take more risk in an sqq trade that's it for you guys today I just want to thank everybody I didn't get any okay Boomer remarks from my effort to quote Luda in my last video I thought for sure I'd get some okay Boomer but know everybody's really encouraging my wife told me that everybody was laughing at me not with me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
EuPed8AwvnI,but hey I just want you guys to know I appreciate all of you as always my friends peace and blessings on your investment journey I look forward to talking to you again in the next video take care [Music] thank you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs, chicken genius Singapore has sold completely out of palantir stock at nine something dollars a share so I want to share obviously my thoughts on do I think that was a good move a bad move in the short term in the long term all those sorts of things in this video he's also calling for stock market crash which I believe he's been calling for for over a year now so we'll speak about that we'll speak about like a few factors that I think is worth paying attention to and kind of the way to think about is a market going to crash Not Crash things like that and um you know before we get into that and by the way at the very end of this video I'm just going to share a few stocks that I'm paying attention to for earnings this week it is actually another busy week four earnings here okay the first place I wanna by the way I hope you guys enjoy as always thank you so much everybody subscribe the channel,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,okay um first place I want to start out here is you know there was a time when I really felt like uh chickens like advice was really really good in regards to Market okay and you know I'm not gonna say he's he's right or wrong in terms of like you know if a Stock's gonna go down in the short term you could buy it back and all those sorts of things the one thing I'll say is just like he used to be very practical in the market don't try to time the market you know build a great portfolio and I watched a lot of his old content and I thought he I thought he did a really good job of messaging of keeping people focused and just seems over the past I would say 12 to 18 months or so he's really gotten off track and he's now all in the market all out of the market all in a stock all out of a stock in you know last week it was all you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,I got my stock portfolio all in palantir and now it's like I'm out of palantir nine something dollars a share right and so it's just all over the place and I can tell you as somebody's been in the market 15 years I've been I've been lost several times and the two main times was 2015 and obviously 2021 2021 you know started buying crazy amounts of unprofitable stocks and got completely away from all the practicality of the market and building out great portfolios of profitable companies and and got into so many you know unprofitable stocks it wasn't even funny I went from a guy that would own like one to two unprofibles to like next thing you know I own like seven it was ridiculous okay so I've been down that road in in 2015 I got into all earnings trades and trying to time in now the market there was even a time period in 2015 where I sold my entire portfolio which is the only time I've ever done that like that was crazy um and I actually did it so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,and I thought I could start timing the market and things like that so in when you're in the market a while like sometimes you just lose yourself and you know he can say he's making money and whatever okay I I'm not a hater I'm not here to hate I just don't think I I just don't think he's on the right track and I don't think he's preaching on the right track because we know how this ends up we know how this ends up and I'm not saying for him maybe he can be the the um one person that is a super successful you know swing trade and trading in Now Stocks and things like that that's from the retail side but we know how this ends up for retail when they try to to think they're going to be traders in the market and then now these positions in and out of their portfolios we know how this ends up for retail doesn't end up well I mean even for Wall Street the most professional money managers that have super unfair advantages even for those guys it usually doesn't end up well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,and so it's no hate I'm not hating him he's always talking about haters I have no and I have no interest in hating him I just think he's gone from making very practical advice that's good for the masses to now this this craziness of you know in and out of the market and in and out of these stocks and and all this stuff man and so that's just my opinion on that that portion of it you know and I I hope eventually he gets back to just that kind of that old you know way of building on great portfolios and stocks you're proud of for the long term and and and those sorts of things and so once again no hate I don't hate him uh you know if chicken if you see this I don't hate you okay I just think in terms of you know your your your strategies and what you're pushing out to a lot of people I mean massive amounts of people watch your videos,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,and I just think you're going away that I don't think is healthy for you or the audience or anything like that that's just my personal opinion so no hate man okay that's bottom line with that that's just my perspective somebody that's seen your channel for quite some time now okay so now in regards to a crash I think there's a few things to keep in mind here okay if you're thinking about market crash one is inflation is becoming less and less of a problem we week after week after week these are true flation numbers that now have us at 3.49 there's a high probability the next time the government numbers come out which is in a little less than a month from now there's a high probability will be something with a low for potentially a high three but probably a low four in front of it okay and so in terms of inflation it's becoming less of a problem the fed's likely done in terms of raising rates why are they likely done well inflation's become so much less of a problem the FED funds rate right now is around,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,you know a little above five percent and as far as true inflation they got us up three point four nine percent even on the US government numbers for last month right that has that 4.9 percent so now we're at a place where CPI is now lower than fed funds rate which means essentially the FED can likely wrap this game up in terms of raising rates it doesn't mean they're going to cut rates they could cut rates if you know anything gets ugly or if they have any data around that you know in a few months from now or a few quarters from now if they want but in terms of raising it doesn't make sense anymore at this point in time if you had a huge Spike up in inflation again and let's say next month came in at five something which is not but let's say that happened it's a whole different ball game then the FED has to at that that time consider you know continuing to raise rates it just doesn't look realistic so it looks like they're gonna I would say 99 sure like they're going to pause now and potentially start cutting based upon the fact that now we have a Fed funds right above CPI and it looks like the spread there is going to start getting big really big and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,really quickly okay another way to think about it is if you're going to talk about you know crashing this Market the really hard thing is folks is you're going to need the biggest companies out there to fall substantially after they already fell last year one is we could be a peak Peak uh trough earnings right now or trough earnings that's a potential okay that's something you have to consider that that you know Q4 q1 and Q2 are kind of trough earnings and things actually get better especially for the big dogs that really run the market in 3Q and 4q it's a consideration the other thing you've got to consider is there's a reason I got La real estate up here okay you know personally I'm certainly not the biggest fan of of Los Angeles I have no intention of ever moving to Los Angeles and no heat to Los Angeles okay it's just not my cup of tea but we can't deny the fact that La real estate is always in insanely high demand why is it well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,it's seen as like the best Market you could possibly invest in for Real Estate outside of maybe Manhattan okay and so nonetheless Le real estate as soon as prices drop a little bit there's always a ton of people ready to buy the same thing I just shared with you there about La real estate is also true about the best stocks in the stock market Apple Microsoft Nvidia Amazon all these companies that are the best of the best companies in the world as soon as our stock prices drop a little bit guess what people are ready to pounce they're ready to buy those stocks and so that's why it's so hard to get those stocks to fall off a cliff and their earnings have held up pretty respectable I mean Apple quarter after quarter I'm like this has to be the quarter Apple you know has horrible earnings and they come in and it's like no,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,it's not that bad you know Microsoft is just as stable as stable can get and so to get those stocks to go down in any substantial way in the crash which once again if you're going to get the market to crash you're going to need Apple Microsoft Nvidia all those companies to crash it's hard man especially when you already got a major mini crash if not a full-on crash for a lot of those stocks last year so that's the problem that's the problem is you need a ton of you need Warren Buffett to say I'm selling out of Apple stock you need other massive investors of Apple say I'm selling Apple stock to put that sort of selling pressure and then you need people to say I'm also not going to buy Apple stock when there's a million people waiting to buy Apple stock at the smallest little dips that's the tough part and so you could always get a crash in the market but it's just it's difficult man,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,and you've got to understand especially when it comes to those companies they have such big weights in the market Apple Microsoft those are the LA real estates okay you know that's the bottom line with that whole situation okay now let's talk about palantir let's talk about you know selling palantir on the nines or whatever okay first off from a long-term perspective obviously I believe that's a very poor decision okay for a long-term perspective I believe you know palantir has such an incredible product and such an incredible opportunity in front of the company and over the next five ten years the profitability is literally at the infant stage those companies just getting the profitability and I mean wait to see how this baby ramps up the profitability over the next several years this is this is like first inning in this game so from that perspective on a long term basis horrible in my opinion just a horrible decision to sell all your palantir stock from a short-term perspective in my personal opinion also a bad decision okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,and the reason being is a company's now been profitable two quarters they need two more quarters of profitability here to ultimately end up getting an S&P500 so we're probably about I would say we're between six and maybe 10 months away from palantir getting in the S&P500 okay if that's a scenario and we're anywhere from six to ten months away I can tell you as we get closer and closer to S&P500 inclusion for palantir what's going to happen with our stock price well likely you're going to continue to see massive inflows in regards to palantir stock price okay you're going to see more and more hedge funds buying in wait,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,I mean Imagine Next quarter they have a third profitable quarter then it's like one more on their end so as you get closer and closer there's going to be more and more people buying in now also from a selling perspective like how many palantir bulls are really going to sell you could have somebody that was just trading at short-term like obviously chicken was there right in regards to selling it but at the end of the day are you really going to get the long-term goals to sell out of that stock,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,no if anything the long-term Bulls now have more conviction in palantir than ever and if anything all the long-term Bulls in the stock are much more likely to continue to buy these shares rather than sell these shares so for palantir we're looking at a story here that is very very bullish for the next you know six to nine months on top of the next six to nine years and that's a rare thing you get in the market where you have a really attractive opportunist stock for the next few months but also you haven't obviously an incredible opportunity for the next few years in regards to this one okay and obviously in regards to palantir here,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,I mean they just beat revenues very nicely last quarter they obviously beat on EPS as well they put pretty low guidance out there my opinion so they could come in with a nice beat and we're looking at a company that on 2024 numbers is trading at a 2024 PE of roughly 36.37 and once again this is a company that's at the infant stage of profitability so when you're talking about a company that's at the infant stage of profitability that has among the best gross margins you'll find of any public company in the world I think I think it might be undervalued significantly and if we want to add a cherry on top in this whole situation look what Alex carp said the depth of Engagement with and demand for artificial intelligence platform is without precedent which means they just have overwhelming amount of either government clients commercial clients asking questions about their product looking in their product interest in their product and if that's the situation you're going to see massive amounts of closed deals for palantir over this next I would say 12 to 36 months and obviously once palantir gets in the door they got a pretty sticky business model there and they're likely going to keep uh you know the majority of these customers they attract those next 12 to 36 months now that everybody has to consider an AI plan for their companies,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,so I mean palantir is in a really good setup for the short term and a really good setup for the long term okay where the stock goes down next week or next month it's anybody's guessing game but I'm just I mean things are positioned pretty darn well for palantir now at this point in time okay so obviously I don't super agree with that as far as earnings going this upcoming week few few companies I'm kind of paying attention to one is Home Depot obviously very very important to pay attention to Home Depot number see what they have to say they're obviously very important always in regards to the housing market I think I think Home Depot keep an eye there I think target keep an eye on target you know Big Dog Target you got to keep an eye there Cisco you know I don't really care too much about them Alibaba Walmart you know if you're interested in any Chinese stocks alibabas want to keep an eye on obviously Walmart,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
ZpAuGkoM5fs,I think Walmarts are good to pay attention to for what they have to say about inflation and John Deere I think that's a good one pay attention to De there and then Foot Locker I personally own Foot Locker stock so I'll be keeping an eye there I hope it goes down I would love to buy some more shares of Footlocker great dividend stock I appreciate y'all much love as always thanks for enjoying this video with me thanks for being subscribed folks and have a great day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

XQFf2T3G88M,okay this one this is a makings of a bank run on svb says Hugh's son will react to that one there second video up here I want to react to uh Ava Labs woo on svb this is a classic Bank Run on Bloomberg so we'll react to that one here and see what's going on there and then third video under react to has nothing to do with SVP I just thought I would hear this gentleman's points he has to make in in my points actually might shock you in this one considering meta is my biggest position but I might have a little different opinion actually than this gentleman I'll hear his points out and then uh kind of share my points off of that so we'll react to that one svb bank by the way is down another 22 percent in after hours we'll see where trades at in the trading day tomorrow you know I mean is it impossible to imagine that babies uh you know under 10 bucks in a matter of a few days it's not okay I'm not placing a bet I'm not gonna go there it's not worth it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,you know my risk no okay it's not worth it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,but I will say this is a a situation is getting very very ugly very very quickly so we'll hear what they have to say by the way uh we're only hours away from me making my next moves buys and sells in the patreon portfolio through Fidelity Investments that's going to be pin comment down there if you want to join us in there that's a no-brainer to be part of that I don't care if you've been in the market for you know a few days or you've been in for a few years like you got to join us in there to see the moves I'm up to and exactly how I build a portfolio on what is becoming a bigger Story by the hour another big california-based Bank anything really can't be called anything but an investor Panic shares of Silicon Valley Bank may not have heard of them it's one of the oldest and biggest banks in California it's not a Traditional Bank it is focused primarily on Tech and VC investors stock closed down today 60 percent it is down another 28 after hours meaning 24-hour decline more than 70 percent now yesterday,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,no if you didn't know basically this bank it it's not just like your your grandma's bank that you know she's got 2000 dollars in a savings account or something or in a checking account this bank has a lot of very high net worth founders of tech companies money tied up in it and um oh you know basically they're all pulling their money out left and right right now like yanking that money right because your money's Only You Gotta remember this right and this is for anybody watching this that you're either at a level where you got significant amounts of money in a bank account or you're going to have some data right okay and I gotta explain this to everybody because I don't think this hits a lot of people and and I don't I like this is so important okay your money is only FDIC insured to 250 000,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,okay now for probably most people watching this video right now that's not a concern for you because you're gonna have less than 250 000 in account but for maybe the top 10 or 20 percent of people watching this video right now there's a good probability you have over 250 000 in account or you're gonna have over 250 000 in an account someday okay so you might just want to split that money apart in a few different places because it is a huge huge risk to you if I mean imagine you got 10 million dollars with svb over here they go under you know what you get you get 250 000 of your 10 million dollars oh yeah it was just a savings account or a checking account doesn't matter doesn't matter if that baby goes under and the money's not there for whatever reason okay for whatever reason the money's not there the government's only backing you to 250. they're not giving you 10 mil as much as you might want it you know good luck,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,and then you could try to do some sort of a lawsuit or something like that and nice good luck with that that's just going to eat up more of your money and there's probably gonna be no money there at the end of the day okay so this is a very significant situation going on here and it's very very serious crypto Focus Bank silvergate Capital said it was shutting down liquidating so what exactly is going on with some of these big Banks particularly in California it could be the sign of a bigger issue CNBC reporter Houston joining us now uh Hugh again maybe not a household name bank,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,but as we talked about with deer dramosa pretty darn important it's a household name uh in the startup world for sure they've been around for four decades that's the thing like almost no one's heard of this unless you're from California like in a really meaning like the VC space like you talk to anybody in the VC space they all know what this bank it's almost like uh like its own little whisper that is so important and like hardly anybody knows about it but the people that do know about it are usually Filthy Rich played an instrumental role in development of a startup culture in this country and that's why it's shocking that you know there seems you know the makings of a Bank Run uh in terms of concern and fear about the return of your money Brian yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,and what where does this go from here there was there was an SEC filing I don't go into the weeds too much at a big other fund General Atlantic Partners well-known veg Capital took maybe or looks like they took a 500 million dollar stake yesterday but clearly did not help today I mean how does this play out you and in your reporting it because our viewers may not care about this one bank is there any contagion risk here well it helps to back up a little bit Ryan,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,so they raised about 2.3 million in uh billion in in debt and Equity today to shore up the hole that had developed in their balance sheet um from people taking out money uh Founders uh obviously not raising money in the public market so you know drawing down the reserves and that the pressure on the bus uh and ill-time better to put into reference how serious this is okay and I had some folks that contacted me about this and kind of put on my like agenda on how big of a deal it was because I think they had seen my video and I think they you know were like hey this is a bigger deal than you know you're kind of thinking here okay even Peter Thiel I'm reading ago you know seven hours ago Peter Thiel Founders fund advises companies to withdraw money from svb Peter Thiel Peter Thiel knows like everything about everything okay and he knows everybody that's everyone,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,and so if that means telling you pull your flip and flapjacking money out it's a serious situation extremely extremely serious he knows like I'm assuming that he must be worried that they're about to go under if Peter thiel's doing that right on some some bonds that you know at you know low uh payouts now my understanding is that uh you know from the people I've talked to there's going to be additional pressure because of the action today and we don't know the extent of that you know a small sample size but I've talked to people who've taken out half of their deposits yeah I'm talking about tens of millions of dollars uh in VC money that they've raised that they parked at Silicon Valley Bank exactly it's not like this is small amounts of money like I said earlier with your grandma's got two thousand dollars in a savings account somewhere or something like that this is crazy amounts of money I'm talking about Founders moving you know Millions tens of millions maybe even nine figures plus out of this this is like crazy Bank Run now you want to talk about systemic risk,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,okay there's two levels of systemic risks that are extremely serious here the first level is that you know potentially them being in intertwined with other Banks out there other funds and those potentially maybe maybe go Kaboom as well okay but the second part and I think this is even more significant is if some of these companies have money tied up there they can't get to it those companies then have to try to raise money from somebody else if they can't raise that money they go under right we know Silicon Valley we know that that whole Tech situation over there most those companies aren't profitable and most of them are losing crazy amounts of money and every three to 12 months they have to raise money and if they don't raise money they don't make it if they don't raise the money they don't make it and like literally that's the end of it okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,so that this is why this is so significant on multiple multiple fronts here that because of the concern that they won't be able to get it out later so this is really a concern nobody knows where it ends we shouldn't feed into the concern and fear however and just report on it it's safe to say that you know there is the makings yeah of a potential run on the dick well there clearly is I mean I don't think we're doing anything wrong Houston we got to go thank you throw the stock chart back up guys down,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,60 today it's down 26 right now it actually sold off more after hours lately Peter Teo reportedly telling people to get out it's a big big story we're continuing to monitor it head over to cbc.com for Hughes latest reporting as well I doubt he was going to get a lot of sleep tonight all right next one up here from Wu on svb thing is of course at the same time we worry about silvergate's implications we think about what's happening with Silicon Valley Bank at the moment it's exposure to technology to startups John just want to bring our audience some breaking news that interestingly the founders fund which a key VC player is advising that its own companies should withdraw funds from Silicon Valley bank now we know the CEO of Silicon Valley Bank has been out there trying to reassure clients as to what the stock drop means what the conservation of its capital at the moment is trying to signify But ultimately we are going to see some concerns being built if Founders fund are indeed advising their own portfolio companies to withdraw funds from svb can I ask you as a Founder John do you have money in traditional Finance do you have money with Silicon Valley Bank well Silicon Valley Bank is one of the banks that we use um as well as some of the other ones that were mentioned,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,so I think the right thing The Prudent thing we've learned is counterparty risk once these things start this is a classic Bank Run and when the blank run starts you don't want to be the last guy there and wondering what happened unfortunately this is the way Banks work they rely on trust when they lose that trust bad things really will happen so basically what it sounds like that gentleman just said right there is it sounds like he just pulled a bunch of money out of there like literally read the tea tree leaves there it basically sounds like that man just pulled a bunch of money out as well I'm sorry I know we have so much to discuss about avarin and what's happening to Avalanche but but we have to stick with these stories it's happening before our eyes what do you do in this situation do you follow the advice of names in the valley light Founders fund and pull the money do you stick with it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,I mean they I have to just point out there were a number of names that Bloomberg cited in its reporting that said what we're seeing in Silicon Valley Bank is not the same as silvergate and actually long term they have a completely solid future what would you do in this circumstance well hopefully there's enough what I would do is you have to diversify out and maybe not pull everything or pull some yeah this back into great financial crisis where you had to diversify your Prime Brokers luckily we have already Diversified,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,so we're less exposed than we were literally just a few weeks or months ago has it been easy to gain that sort of information from Silicon Valley Bank at the moment are you reply relying on analyst reports that we get and indeed some of the reporting coming from our own journalists relying on your own interactions the operator always has a better view you know the Cadence of responses and how things are working the the size of transactions all of those little subtle hints is what we're relying on as an operator by the time you read it in the news or something unfortunately it's probably a little bit late okay man that guy was felt like he was withholding a lot of information felt like he was withholding a lot a lot of information there what it sounded like to me is this man might have knew something was already up so he was already pulling money did you hear him say we were not nearly as exposed as we were a few weeks or a month ago right sounds like that man knew something and it also sounds like he might be polling already so there was a there was a strange there was a strange gentleman there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,okay I'll I'll put it like that it seemed like he was just withholding a lot a lot and I don't know maybe he didn't intend for it to be like that but I mean just based upon what I just watched it seemed like that man was withholding information let's just call it that okay next one up here is on a metastock here just to finish off my thoughts on this this whole situation is extremely serious I think I think there's a I would call it right now 50 50 if that baby's even around in in a few weeks from now like literally that's how freaky it is for that situation it's like a 50 50 and it's crazy to think like you know just a matter of a few months ago it was perfectly fine and now for it to be at a situation where it's a 50 50.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,it's a coin flip if they'll even be around in a few weeks it's extremely serious but I'm telling you with with them already having issues Financial issues and then you've got all these people also pulling out Millions tens of millions maybe hundreds of millions of dollars and it's like everybody there right there's pure Punic it's a it's a shirt of bankrupt like this is a type of stuff you saw on like the Great Depression right like that's just crazy to even think that's going on but this is once again this isn't really a traditional thing this is no JPMorgan Chase this is no Wells Fargo a Bank of America or anything like that all right they call themselves Silicon Valley Bank but when you look into what they're up to what they were doing it's like is this really a bank it doesn't really seem like much of a bank other than a lot of you know High net worth individuals in in the tech field might hold money there either for their companies uh or for themselves,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,but I can tell you is it didn't feel like a Traditional Bank by any stretch of imagination okay last video up here to react to is this one on meta and tech stocks in general and uh I might have a different opinion we'll see priority um so uh look interest rate spikes last year unprecedented and unprecedented interest rate spikes last year just demolished the tech sector NASDAQ and the consumer Internet space that I looked at which traded off 55 I don't think you're going to get that kind of shock this year and frankly what you've seen so far this year is consumer internet outperformance,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,but you know interest rates the the sector anybody with um long duration assets future profitability always very sensitive to interest rate changes now is there another shoe to drop in this economy perhaps companies that you cover is there kind of a A banks type moment that we had today and I granted you know this this wasn't too big too bad for the banks compared to what internet has been through but uh these economic headwinds has has internet largely taken its lumps already do you think well they've certainly taken lump since from a stock picker's perspective look what we focus on is that multiples have been de-risked we're close to trough multiples actually we are at drop multiples for most of the internet names estimates have been de-risked we just finished the December quarter the prince finally rolled through in the last couple of weeks that's the first time in a year and a half we've actually had as a whole upwards estimates revisions rather than pretty substantial downwards estimates revisions there's no question that you could still the estimates can always still further come down but the one thing that helps a lot of these companies is all the cost actions all the Rifts those are always unfortunate they're always painful when they occur but in some of these companies they were clearly necessary and they kind of protect that earnings,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,and so I think that the downside to earnings risk is much less at this point than it's been at any point in the last 12 months speaking of reductions in force I agree with that you know very low expectations that's a you know one of the great things you know let's say the S&P500 companies NASDAQ 100 type companies have even small cap companies low expectations I mean very very low expectations because of of all the concerns because all the worries about recessions about this about that about troubling numbers that have been coming in over the past let's call it several quarters now right obviously fed's still raising is worrying you know worries about inflation only it's leading to a very conservative Outlook in terms of companies and their earnings and ultimately that's a good thing for stocks because now it's like you don't have to come in with a lot to impress right when your expectations are through the roof it gets hard to even impress in any significant way right know some of these companies have these expectations that are kind of on the floor and all they need to do is report a little better than expected and where they see huge pop you know I think Med is a perfect example,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
XQFf2T3G88M,and we'll see if this gentleman you know what his opinion is on meta I think that's a perfect example right that companies just their estimates got pushed down so low that when they came out and it was okay it was like oh you know there we go big pop Tesla another good example of that Nvidia another good example of that Netflix another good example of that you know some of those stocks just get way oversold to the downside and and you don't need much to push it up on the other side payoffs and discipline meta has moved from your number three Net large cap pick to number one uh why well in part because it looks like we're going to have more cost actions taking place you know Zuckerberg called this the year of efficiency I think he largely was tracking that way last year and then we had this blip around the September quarter earnings when we decided when he decided that um he wasn't going to slow down expenses and then two weeks later changed his mind and said he was,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,but I think most of the signals have been this company's going to operate more leanly and there's plenty of opportunity for them to do that but in addition to that I think this reels rollout that's just been in place for you know oh well over 12 months I think it's actually starting to really come in positively for the company it's driving higher users higher engagement levels and they're starting to close the monetization gap so it's in terms of reels I've been talking about that for quite some time on the channel right um you know quite some time and obviously Matt is the biggest position I have in the public account for example right uh the stock matters to me just as much if not more than any other stock I possibly hold when it comes to meta is this the number one big Tech stock to be buying in 2023 my opinion on that is no I believe it actually is Amazon for 2023.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
XQFf2T3G88M,I believe metastalk was the number one stock to be buying in 2022 especially in the back half this year back after the year when that stock was just crashing 150 120 under 100 bucks right at the lows it was down to 88 bucks I think last year was really that that crazy opportunity I think meta's still stealing money at this point in time uh but I wouldn't put it as number one right now I would put Amazon as number one over matter right now probably number three oh boy that's close it would be between Shopify and Tesla right now for that number three position there another reason you're going to have Revenue growth acceleration in this name in the back half of the year and then finally you know they did the um the ad targeting the ad attribution model at uh at Facebook at meta was severely challenged by the Apple privacy changes,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
XQFf2T3G88M,but we're now well beyond a year 18 months into that and we're we're seeing the company based on our Channel checks get better and better with the ad attribution models which means the return on ad spend is rising which means there's another reason why advertisers are going to start coming back and spending more of their dollars with uh with with Facebook with Instagram so there's just a couple of things that are working bringing down costs and I think you're going to get this acceleration at Revenue growth it's trading at 14 times earnings I think there's 50 upside in the stock between now and the end of the year wow that's beautiful,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
XQFf2T3G88M,and when it comes to meta like you spoke about their efficiency I mean the net income should blast higher over the next few years EPS as well right and at the end of the day if you need to advertise for a business the number one and number two places you still got to advertise all these years later Facebook and Instagram then after that everything else comes after that I appreciate everybody joining me as always 24 200 plus subscribers if not twenty four thousand three hundred subscribers now I appreciate each and every one of you that subscribe the channel alsoever thank you everybody that supports the channel on patreon you get in there ASAP I'm about to post the new moves I'm going to make in there there so you get to see access to that each and every week all the moves I'm making and uh get to track the the portfolio over time I appreciate you all much love and have a great day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8, Warren Buffett's first TV interview ever boy do we have a great reaction to get into here tonight folks uh definitely one of my favorite videos on YouTube I wanted to react to here and uh let's just get straight into this guys I appreciate everybody joining me I think you'll get a lot of value out of this one a lot of gems and um just a lot of greatness out of here this in this one today so I appreciate everybody subscribe the channel let's get straight into this one I'm so excited secular approach who have also been very successful let's take Warren Buffett of Omaha Nebraska if you would put ten thousand dollars in 1965 into his company Berkshire Hathaway you would have one million today Warren was a chapter in my 1972 book super money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,so I've known him a long time he learned his trade with Ben Graham the original dean of security analysis at Columbia University I don't think Warren has ever been on television until this interview and he has certainly never recorded publicity but recently he got a lot of it when he emerged as the key figure in the Takeover of ABC by Capital Cities Warren will be the largest shareholder of the new company and his own net worth is now far in excess of 500 million dollars but when I spoke with him last fall in his office so the reason I'm giggling about that is 500 million dollars is like so much money right like if you have 500 million dollars like it's saying but compared to what Warren Buffett has today it's like nothing it's like a can of soda to him it's just it's crazy to think like that right and uh Warren Buffett was not known at this time and I know he's so famous nowadays that it's hard to even imagine a Warren Buffett like not super famous right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,but uh back then like no one really knew about him this is is obviously way before like social media heck this is barely after the color TV days here it was in Omaha he very characteristically made his investment style seem so perfectly simple the first world on investment is don't lose and the second role on investment is don't forget the first rule and that's all the rules there are I mean it uh if you buy things for Far Below what they're worth and you buy a group of them you basically don't lose money Lauren what do you consider the most important quality for an investment manager it's the temperamental quality not an intellectual quality you don't need tons of IQ in this business I mean you have to have enough IQ to get from here to Downtown Omaha,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,but uh but uh you do not have to be able to play three-dimensional chess or be in the top leagues in terms of bridge playing or something of the sort you need a stable personality you need a temperament that neither derives great pleasure from being with the crowd or against the crowd because this is not a business where you take polls it's a business where you think and Ben Graham would say that you're not right or wrong because a thousand people agree with you and you're not right or wrong because a thousand people disagree with you you're right because your facts and your reasoning are right what do you do what would he just explain there I mean just there's so many gems right off the bat there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,and I think one of the most important points he brings out is the temperament right in in I'll be honest for men right which the investment Community is mostly men right in terms of stock picking making Investments a lot of us definitely have uh you know you have to deal with that element of just what it means to be a man in your flight in fight syndrome right and we're just kind of wired that way and so in the stock market it's like pretty much the worst way to be wired because you can make some very very rash decisions right and that's the worst way to approach the market you've got to be very steady you you hear what he just mentioned there at the beginning he just mentioned something very important buying assets that are undervalued,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,right he didn't mention anything about you need to wait until the S&P500 is this number or if tell the 50-day moving average is over here in the 200 Moving Day averages over here or something like that didn't it is very very simple you research assets see if they're undervalued buy them when they're undervalued if they go lower buy some more of them right throw them in the filing cabinet if they get fairly valued or overvalued you got a better place to put the money over the coming years and you can go ahead and sell them off and take your profits and move on to the next one right it's a very very simple approach and that's what has always resonated with me from Warren Buffett from the time I came across him 2008 2009.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,it's different than 90 percent of the money managers who are in the market certainly most of the professional investors focus on what the stock is likely to do in the next year or two and they have all kinds of all kinds of uh Arcane uh methods of of approaching that but they do not really think of themselves as owning a piece of a business that the real test of whether you're investing it's crazy because of the way he's talking here this is the same stuff today same stuff,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,all these all these decades and decades and decades later in what he's speaking about is still as true today as this was many many many many many decades ago when this uh you know his first TV interview ever happened here Warren Buffett just classic a value stand point or not is whether you care whether the stock market is open tomorrow if you're making a good investment in a security it shouldn't bother you if they close down the stock market for five years all the ticker tells me is the price and I can look at the price occasionally to see whether the price is outlandishly cheap or outlandishly high but but prices don't tell me anything about a business business uh business figures themselves tell me something about a business but the price of a stock doesn't tell me anything about a business I would rather value a stock or a business first and not even know the price so that I'm not influenced by the price and establishing my valuation and then look at the price later to see whether it's way out of line with what my value is as somebody who's been in the market for 15 years what he just said there is one of the best gems I mean this man is just loaded with gems but that's one of the best gems because as somebody who's been doing this a long time I can tell you there's been many times periods in the past where I've been influenced first by a stock price right and you can't do that you really got to look business by business sometimes it's easy to look at a stock and be like it's down 50,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,it must mean it's a great discount but then when you start going through the financials what's going on with the business model you start to realize oh my gosh this company is actually in huge financial problems or their business is just falling off the reels a good example of this recently is I looked into a company named Hasbro Hasbro's a stock that's gotten hit very hard and I was influenced right away from the price of Hasbro the stocks down significantly from where it used to be and the valuation at surface level doesn't look that expensive I start to dig into the financials it Hasbro and I find a disaster zone for this company I'm like oh my gosh I see why this stock is down so much but many times investors get too in love with the price at first oh it's down this much,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,oh the Ford P says this all the price of sales is this and they that influences there's decision making so they go buy that stock because of that okay business first then financials then figure out the valuation if the valuations rate then we can go ahead and make a purchase decision if the valuation is not right then you know we can we can just you know keep it on our watch list whatever right and maybe at some point we'll come down to that there's thousands of stocks in the stock markets so that means there's thousands of opportunities in the stock market Buffett chose to stay in this world Omaha Nebraska where corn grows just minutes from downtown now Omaha is a nice town but nobody claims World Financial Center to hear the only Thundering Herd is actually on four feet don't you find Omaha a little bit off the Beaten Track for the investment,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,World well believe it or not get mail here and uh we got periodic Olsen we get all the facts needed to make decisions and unlike Wall Street you'll notice we don't have 50 people coming up and whispering in our ear that we should be doing this or that this afternoon you appreciate the lack of stimulation here I like the lack of stimulation we get facts not stimulation here how can you stay away from Wall Street well if I were on Wall Street I'd probably be a a lot poorer at uh uh you get over stimulated in Wall Street and uh uh you hear lots of things,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,and and you you may you may shorten your focus and a short focus is not conducive to uh to Long profits and uh here I can just focus on what businesses are worth and I don't need to be in Washington to figure out what the Washington Post uh newspaper is worth and I don't need to be in New York to figure out what some other company is worth it's it's simply it's an intellectual process and unless the Lost static there is in that intellectual process really the better off you are 100 two points you can be anywhere in the world well pretty much anywhere in the world right in some countries may not allow you to buy stocks but you don't have to be in New York City to be a great investor you can be anywhere I remember reading a story this is probably a decade ago we're now uh phenomenal phenomenal fund manager out of Utah right and so you could be anywhere in the world and be great at running money and get some phenomenal returns you don't have to be in New York City and Lakey spoke about there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,you know you if you're there you might actually produce far worse returns because everybody's so tied up into the short term what's going on here and you start making these short-term decisions which we know statistically the more short-term decisions you start to make the more you're likely to underperform the market over time right and uh for Warren Buffett he has a long-term focus on these companies so what's going to happen with the FED tomorrow or the fed the next day or the economy the next day or all these sorts of uh you know guessing games right it's just not even really worth that attention in the end you need to buy companies that you know regardless of what happens in the economic environment those companies can make it through they got great balance sheets great income statements and they'll make it through their business models are proven like that right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,and so I just love his whole whole outlook when it comes to that the intellectual process is is defining your level defining your area of competence and valuing businesses and then within that area of competence finding whatever cells at the at the cheapest price in relation to value and there are all kinds of things I'm not confident to Value but there are a few that I am confident about have you ever bought a technology company no I really haven't in 30 years of investing not one I haven't understood any of them so you haven't ever owned for example IBM company I'm a sensational company but I haven't known IBM and so here is this technological Revolution going on and you're not going to be a participant gone right past me is that all right with you it's okay with me so this was in 1985 so this was really when Tech was just in its infant stage at this point in time I believe Apple was founded uh just a few years before this if I recall it right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,and so this was the baby infant stages and what he brings up here is such an important point that I think every single person watching this video right now can take away right is you don't have to understand every single company you don't have to understand every single industry right if you read a 10K if you listen to conference calls to companies and you still don't get it it's fine there's thousands of opportunities in the stock market man so there's everything everything from sugar water companies like Coca-Cola and Pepsi and and monster beverage to uh trash companies like Republic Services and waste management to you know massive tech companies such as apple and Microsoft to small cap companies to folks that sell paper towels and tissues like this there's a whole range,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,and so you're going to be able to find some Industries and sectors that you really understand really really well and where these companies are going over time you don't have to get it all and if you don't get it all don't feel bad about that there's Warren Buffett's been doing just fine for himself without understanding every company out there in every sector and every industry okay and so that's just stay in your circle of competence stay in your circle of confidence it's key in this investing game I don't have to make money in every game I mean I don't know what cocoa beans are going to do I don't you know there are all kinds of things I don't know about and that may be too bad,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,but uh you know why should I know all about them I haven't worked that hard that's a big statement he just made there because that's the difference between Warren Buffett and a lot of these folks on Wall Street what he just said there that's the differentiator between him a lot of folks on Wall Street a lot of folks on Wall Street they pretend like they know everything and they know where everything's going to magically go and almost always their predictions are wrong right he says I'm not going to try to predict the you know where cocoa beans are going right I don't know that I haven't worked that hard on understanding that he's not afraid to admit when he doesn't understand or know where something's going and even people that may study that still don't know where that is going right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,and I think that is so key you've got to have that kind of self humility as a investor in the market that you're not going to understand everything you're not going to know everything that's the bottom line you have the people that understand that like a Warren Buffett here any other people that don't and they they want to have a prediction about everything and here's where I think the treasury's going and here's a 2 versus 10 and here's why I think this is going to happen here and here's why you know this commodity over here is going to go up and this one's going to go down and at some point in time you're just like you're spread too thin how much time are you really spending on that there's only so much time in a day so you're going to tell me you you know where natural gas price is going and you know where corn prices are going and you also know where this stock is going and you also know where the Market's going,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,and you also know what the fed's going to do and you also know the trust like no one knows that of that there's not enough time in a day just to understand where the price of corn is going you have to track weather you're gonna have to track you know how crops are doing you have to track so many different things just to know that one little segment there never mind these other million things over here in the Securities business you literally every day have thousands of the major American corporations offered you at a price and a price that changes daily and you don't have to make any decisions you have to make nothing is forced upon you so you there are no called strikes in the business the picture just stands there and throws balls at you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,and uh if you're playing real baseball and it's between the knees and the shoulders you either swing or you got a strike hold on you have to get too many calls I knew you're out in the Securities business you sit there and they throw a U.S steel at 25 and they throw General Motors at 60 and you don't have to swing at any of them they may be wonderful pitches to swing at but if you don't know enough you don't have to swing and you can sit there and watch thousands of pitches and finally get one right there where you want it something that you understand and then you swing and so you might not swing for six months you might not swing for two years isn't that boring it would it would bore most people and and certainly boredom is a is is a problem with most professional money managers if they if they if they try to sit out an inning or two not only do they get somewhat antsy but their clients are starting to start yelling swing you bum you know from the from the stands,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,and that's very tough for people to do well exactly because the thing about it from the customer standpoint right they're like if the money manager is not doing anything with the money why do they why do they even holding on to it I could hold on to my own cash if I wanted to hold on to cash right um I I'm giving you that money so you can invest it for me now so we can just sit there do nothing right and and also if they see other people getting returns or those sorts of things they're kind of like why why am I not getting these returns that other people are getting your approach seems so simple why doesn't everybody do it well I think partly because it is so simple that the academics for example focus on on um all kinds of variables because academics you mean professors right yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZFqSblxDzU8,the data is in business school sure and the data's there so they focus on whether if you buy stocks on Tuesday and sell them on Friday you're better offer if you buy them in election years and sell them in other years you're better off or if you buy small companies there are all these variables because the data are there and and they've learned how to manipulate data and as a friend of mine says to a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail and once you have these skills you just are are dying to uh to utilize them in some way but they aren't important uh if I were being asked to participate in a business opportunity would it make any difference to me whether I bought it on a Tuesday or Saturday or an election year or something it's not what a businessman thinks about in buying businesses so why think about it when buying stocks because stocks are just pieces of businesses yeah I absolutely love that just Warren Buffett giving out so many gems there I hope you guys really enjoyed that make sure you subscribe the channel,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

3FBcP9Ui2HQ, hello there folks and welcome in to i think this is the fifth video in the history of this channel we're talking about tesla stock in this video uh i just watched a great piece put out by a channel called solving the money problem and uh i've seen many videos over the last couple years from this gentleman he's the most i think he's the most bullish tesla person on youtube honestly he makes me feel like i'm a tesla bear to be quite honest and he makes a great point in this video and i thought this was worth doing a reaction to this because i think the point he makes here is one of the most important points in regards to analysts that not a lot of people understand or see out there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,and i think this is very important so let me react to this and let's talk about this here target on the stock is what 733 dollars that's essentially not far from where we're at right now i'm sure many of you saw this one coming we're looking at the tippranks.com profile liftjet osborne of cowan with the 733 per share price target on tesla stock i'm super big on credibility around these parts and um well let's see here initiated coverage on tesla in september 2016 with a cell continued to suggest investors sell throughout 2017 and 2018 and 2019 and 2020,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,and then after tesla stock starts heading toward the moon inexplicably changes the tune to a hold hold hold hold hold hold now if you've been following the advice of jeff never buy you would never have purchased tesla stock there is zero zero buy ratings in the last call it five or so years zero is this someone who has any credibility at all when it comes to tesla stock and i would argue no success rate on the stock 22 average profit on stock loss of 128.8 now this isn't to say that jeff may not have some valid points about tesla but this is to say that when jeff has anything at all to say about tesla's stock it's really not worth listening at the same time that i personally believe tesla stock is the best risk adjusted opportunity by miles so we'll get into more of this in just a second here and talking about the competition and talking about uh you know what's going on in that landscape i think that overarching point there is really why i wanted to do this reaction i think that is one of the most important subjects that is so underrated in the stock market because the analyst community is this massive thing in the stock market and if an analyst comes out and says buy the stocks many times the stock walls and move up because an analyst comes out and says buy it right and many times if an analyst says sell the stock the stock will move down right and it's crazy how much power these analysts have and especially the ones that work for a lot of the biggest investment banks and biggest banks in,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,general right they have a lot of power and they can at least in the short term many times basically control where a stock price goes and here we are in this moment where it's like this man has been wrong on the stock for six years for six flip and flap jack in years and so if you were wrong about a stock for 6 12 18 months maybe even 24 months fair play okay six years is a whole different animal if you know this man was saying sell the stock when it was down and out right meanwhile he was still saying sell the stock even in moments when model 3 had already ramped when the company had made great strides to profitability and free cash flow he was still saying sell right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,i mean it would have been one thing for him to say like hold or sell back when you know the the business model was more questionable like when i was getting involved with it and they were obviously losing a lot of money back in those days right i was very confident that tesla was going to make this flip to profitability and immense profitability and that's something that played out but the fact that that man saw margin starting to improve free cash flow starting to improve profitability start to improve the revenue skyrocketing the insane demand and he still still remains sell on that stock right and then once the stock price starts going to the moon as they say right then to olson flip and say hey you know what uh don't buy the stock just hold the stock i mean it's like come on man,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,and yet these people get so much publicity obviously and if this man comes out and says sell or buy it's going to make all these different news releases and everybody's going to pay attention to it and they're going to go on these big news networks and things like that when it's like what credibility do you have if you're wrong about this particular stock six years in a row right i mean uh that's kind of ridiculous i think just at the end of the day but that's the analyst community that's wall street that's part of the stock market gain i don't think it's right but it is part of the game right personally aware of in the stock market jeff osborne here is recommending don't buy the stock no no no,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,no at best just hold on this will not age well and speaking of credibility i encourage you set a reminder for 12 24 36 months time for me to revisit this video and this prediction and me taking a dump on jeff but having no idea what he's talking about at least when it comes to tesla's stock uh what did you see in the earnings report that tells you we could go sideways from here he's very very confident very very confident about tesla in their future i would just put it that way that's what i said this man makes me feel like i'm a tesla bear it's a whole difference um you know we were looking for an over 400 million dollar charge uh this quarter from the bitcoin uh collapse unfortunately uh that didn't play out and uh it was about a quarter of that given they sold three quarters of their stake uh they also had a pretty dramatic what's his word choice there why is it unfortunate why is it unfortunate what's unfortunate about that the bitcoin collapse unfortunately uh they didn't play out and uh it was about a quarter of that given they sold it's almost like this man was rooting for the stock to go down he's like unfortunately uh it didn't happen and uh stock went up their steak uh they also had a pretty dramatic uh decline in r d expenses uh but really the next few quarters are really about ramping up two new factories uh they haven't done that since shanghai ramped up that'll be the the laser focus moment for investors as well as there's a bunch of new competitive threats coming out so according to jeff who as we've just seen a bunch of new competitive threats coming out you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,oh man it just cracks me up it's crazy incredible and i mean the literal sense of incredible not the colloquial sense just not credible tesla has some actual legitimate competitive threats coming and i think this actually is a valid point tesla will be producing them themselves cannibalising their own products that's about the only legitimate threats to tesla that tesla has is their new products uh you see ford in the news today doubling down on their ev strategy but also gm this week with the blazer and you've got the silverado on deck as well so uh so you know this talk of competition coming you know for anybody that's watching this it's been a tesla bowl for many many years this has been the thing that has been talked about for the longest time the competition's coming competition is coming but we have yet to see and here we are now in the back half of 2022 we have yet to see any serious competitive threat in terms of big sales volume in north america right or in europe for that matter china is a little bit of a messy market,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,but that's a little bit of a whole other situation on what's a true ev and different things like that right but we're in this moment in time where in north america it's like who's really moving big volume when it comes to evs here in the back half of 2022 it's like tesla and that's it everybody else has got ev products out there now but the issue there's so many issues for all these competitors let's call them that of tesla that want to compete in electric vehicles right all these companies are going to have to go through this awkward stage of basically destroying the profits they're making from ice vehicles to try to funnel money into evs which they're gonna likely lose money on and that's why you can't even like i looked at ford i was looking at ford today they had this uh incredible quarter they just reported they blew revenue out of the water they blew earnings per share out of the water,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,and i was watching the stock price reaction after this massive beats stock price was up like three percent four percent after hours i was like why is that stock not you know they just blew numbers out of the water like why is that stock not up 10 15 20 percent well because ford investors or anybody that pays attention to stock understands the market's moving to evs and if ford's going to start making a bunch of evs they're going to likely end up losing a ton of money and so you're going to watch the profitability of ford erode and erode any road if that company sells more and more evs so they're kind of in this catch 22 because it's like they've got to make more evs they've got to continue on this path because that's where the market is going toward evs but at the same time they're going to likely lose a fortune at least for the next few years for every ev sold and in order to get to a place where they're prof profitable as far as selling these no one knows if that day is ever going to fully actually come for those companies and if it does it's going to likely be years in in the future remember tesla look at how long it took tesla to get profitable i mean that company was making evs for over a decade before they finally hit profitability right it was a it was a long drawn-out battle to finally get to profitability and start to get to scale,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,and now we see tesla starting to hit margins and starting to get to levels of profitability that was we no one ever even conceived that an automaker could get this profitable even myself as somebody that was a tesla bull and was buying this talk in 2018 2019 they've gotten much more profitable than i even expected at this stage of the game which is almost scary for everybody else meanwhile tesla's going to be able to reinvest back into the business as a profitable eva maker right while the other guys are going to be in the situation where they're going to likely be losing a bunch of money on evs and trying to invest into it and it's a big wild card if they're going to ever reach big scale who's to say everybody's going to want an av from ford right and they're going to be doing millions of volume a year in evs who's to say that everybody's going to want an electric silverado like we don't know maybe maybe not you know we have we haven't seen any proof of that yet right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
3FBcP9Ui2HQ,so it's a big huge wild card and um you know we we do know tesla moves crazy volume right we do know that there's massive demand for those sorts of evs but what about everybody else do they really care that remains to be seen and that's why those shareholder bases are having trouble getting anybody really excited about their kind of futures so anyways guys much love as always i hope you enjoyed this video i wanted to make sure we shout it out solving the money problem because i think he just made a great point there about analysts that's obviously like just usually swept under the rug and i think that's worth addressing there so much love as always guys and have a great day don't forget to subscribe brand new channel peace,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E, howdy there folks and welcome into a brand new video on the brand new channel uh this one i'm excited to get into i haven't watched it yet but it seems like it's gonna be an interesting one big short trader danny moses which if you've ever seen the movie the big short you remember that name warns its early stages of earnings cuts and massive layoffs so i want to hear what he has to say here um want to go through it might give my obviously two cents on this and yeah i hope you guys enjoy this as always thank you for being subscribed everybody i think we just hit 5 000 subscribers on this channel so i appreciate all you guys joining me i didn't expect the channel to kind of build up this fast,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,i think i've only mentioned it maybe once or twice on the main channel so i appreciate you guys joining me and let's get into this reed is still too bullish ahead of the cpi report danny moses of the big short fame is founder of moses ventures danny good to see you in person here at the nasdaq market site great to be here thanks for having me um are you net short in your portfolio i mean is that how you view the world i would say i'm not that long i think there's opportunities there's always opportunities on both sides of the equation but the stuff i'm seeing right now i think it's presenting it's set up for short so okay so what do you see happening tomorrow and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,and your concerns i think the obsession with every print that goes by with all this economic data whether it's 8.7 8.4 ppi on wednesday whatever that might be it's really about what's going on behind the scenes and that's what's important earnings are coming down layoffs are starting to happen fed rates take a while to build themselves into the economy and it's happening now so we've seen peak earnings in this cycle for sure we've seen probably the lowest rates in this cycle for sure and what you guys were talking about earlier that really resonates with me is you would want to see 10-year yields now moving higher not lower because it's telling you something so a two-year 10-year inverted by 50 basis points is telling you something two negative quarter gdp growth is telling you something and purchasing power is diminishing because the consumer is not keeping up on their wages with so that's a bad witch's brew as we say which is brew he snuck in here by the way i'm sitting here yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,so i mean obviously if it's anybody in relation to the big short movie in that whole gang they always are going to come from more of a skeptical angle and more of a shorting angle from for the market like pretty much almost always that's just the way those guys are michael berry that whole group um so i think it's just important to kind of understand now uh the point i think i wish he would have made out there uh that i think was very important is you know he was talking about oh if you know cpi number had come in at eight point seven eight point four or you know whatever the number was right i wish he would have made the point essentially about like no matter what the number is still ridiculously high which i think is very very important like you know we came in at 8.5 right 8.7 was expected okay it's a little better than expected that's good we're on the the right track but let's not fool ourselves in 8.5 percent is ridiculously high okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,and that's even with the fact that you know most people feel like the government kind of cheats those numbers through all these different kind of tactics and things like that and so the real number is probably 10 plus like regardless of the number is still insanely high next month hopefully we come at maybe you know maybe like a seven nine or seven seven something like that still insanely high so it's like yeah we're making some progress potentially now but let's not fool ourselves these numbers are still ridiculously high and inflation is still a massive problem it's going to be a problem for this entire year i think the biggest question is is it a problem for 2023 and i think that's going to be what drives the stock market in 2023 either to the downside or upside will be does inflation stick throughout 23 and the fed just has to keep raising rates and we have to keep trying to basically hurt the economy or uh you know do uh does inflation rate continue to come down and we get into a better scenario he's right next to me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,i will tell you last summer the only person talking about stagflation that i remember was danny moses it's right before us now so my question to you danny with two's tens going to 50 basis points inverted there's no arrows in the quiver of the federal reserve to fight this and they can say they're going to pivot they're going to pause but if they do that commodities go back up and the inflation problem continues how do they get out of this mess i mean they're just you know they're certainly going to pause at some point but why would they pause is it because inflation's coming down or things are stuck in the mud,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,i think it's probably a combination of both i think we've seen peak inflation but i don't know what they can do they're unwinding and that's important what danny moses just said he said i think we've seen peak inflation and just in case anybody's confused about that that does not mean uh magically like we're at no inflation in the you know in the numbers or something like that what he means is in terms of the rate of increase and we hit over a nine percent number last month and now we're at 8.5 so he believes like we've already peaked now inflation-wise in terms of that rate of increase it doesn't mean you know he believes that you know we're going to get into deflation or something like that obviously he thinks we're going to continue to have inflation but i think that's just important to understand that and it's important to understand that he thinks the worst is behind us with that rate of increase okay trillion dollar balance sheet here so i tell people this is a little bit of the 70s 80s 90s to 2000s,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,it's all kind of mixed in but there is no precedent for what we are seeing right now and look what has already happened with the fed having done very little i mean already and the builders have gotten hit you see what's going on in in in that sector so the consumer's starting to feel it and with savings rates where they are right now where they've dropped there's not a lot of margin for error here on the consumer side some yeah you know going into this year and i remember i said this on millennial money back when we had the show and kevin and everybody was on that show um you know this was at the end of 2021 i said my biggest concern for the economy in in 2022 was going to be the middle class because inflation was starting to really ramp up in a meaningful way and and you know if you just run the numbers like the less income you have the more inflation hits you that's just the way it works essentially my biggest worry for 2023,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,and i know that seems a long time away because we're only in august right now as i record this video my biggest word for 2023 is the real estate market we're already seeing considerable weakness there and i'm very worried about the home builders i'm very worried and not and not from the standpoint of like their stock prices and what their revenues are i care less about that what i'm worried about is how many direct and indirect jobs basically are are fed through the real estate industry when you understand like what it takes to build a house and you understand how many jobs building a home creates and when you understand how many people make money and how many direct and indirect jobs this thing behind you it's insane somebody makes that table over there and that table over there and the chairs that everybody always says i have too many chairs right and somebody's got to make this chandelier up here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,and they make money and somebody made this tv here and somebody made this fireplace here and somebody you know had to transport all this wood to build this house right and the painters made money off this and the flooring company made money off this right and the countertop people they made money off this like when you go into it it's a huge huge process in the backyard people all make money if real estate comes to a grinding halt which we'll see what happens with that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,but if if obviously if mortgage rates continue to go up it's going to come to a grinding hole with the fact that things are already unaffordable as it is right so many people are out of work and that's just a very bad thing for the economy that's part of the reason why we had such a deep long recession in the great financial crisis is we we killed the real estate industry the real estate industry was dead for like three or four years and if that's a scenario there's a lot of people are going to be out of work man that's just how this works and so i'm glad he he didn't really elaborate on that point but i'm glad he at least brought that up there for a moment so you spoke to employment a bit earlier,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,and so what we've seen so far is the the unemployment or the peaking of unemployment that we're seeing is more so in the tech sector versus you know the spinning power is really the spinning power is really being challenged in the lower third of of the consumer base what is it that the fed needs to see from an employment standpoint in that middle third to upper third to get the people that are clamoring for this pivot to have something to kind of hang their hat on yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,i don't think they care so much about the middle and upper third i think walmart customer and walmart told you the day before the fed went i think part of that pre-announcement was to announce to the fed look what's going on we tell you right now the consumer is struggling they're spending all their money on gas and food and there's really nothing left and so fed is certainly watching that that's kind of an impact but there are layoffs occurring in the middle to upper now for the first time and those are high-paying jobs and that will have an impact i think on the market that we've yet to see so this lag effect is now i think you know going to come around here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,so danny you just said that you know we're in a in terms of job losses it's more of a what they call white-collar recession which um it versus like a blue color recession so a blue color recession would be you know the the waitress loses her job you know waiting tables or whatever right and the busboy doesn't have work uh versus maybe you know somebody that's in the management at company being let go let's say for instance and so or somebody in the marketing department for that restaurant company being let go so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,yeah that's kind of the difference there you know definitely jobs are still plentiful out there but the worry is that you know it's just lower paying jobs now at this point in time and a lot of the uh let's call them higher paying jobs those companies have pulled back massively and maybe they're at a point where they're either not hiring or they're only hiring the absolute best and if they don't fit that criteria right now they're kind of like ah whatever which is a very different environment than where we've been in the past several years where it's been an environment where it's like you know hire everybody you can basically whistling through the graveyard what is that like uh yeah you know the big short thing what are they missing we just said the s p just rallied 15 that's one heck of a rally in a very short period of time right and so the nasdaq you know again look at you see today the market like felt really sloppy the nasdaq was down like one and a half percent,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,but you know what microsoft and apple were punched on the day okay unchanged it was keeping the s p together here so what you know it really feels like again there's a lot of people calling for bottoms that sort of thing what are investors missing right here i think you can own the quality i think you're going to see those stocks traded a premium to the historical valuations because they're going to hide in them these meme stocks which i call assessments not investments is really what they are i don't even watch i will watch them to indicate the health of the retail investor but there's not healthy what you see those are not healthy moves in bed bath beyond amc gamestop they're just not and we know where they're going to end or at least i think i know where they're going to end in and so you want to hold on my opinion on this is i actually don't think it's retail put although retail might hold some of these stocks you know bed bathing beyond amc,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
r8SUuudrP5E,i think when you get these massive moves i don't think that's magically retail olson has a ton of money to flood these stocks what i personally think that is i think that's wall street i think this hedge fund screwing around they're the only ones that have that sort of money to just flood into a stock i don't think retail is sitting on the sideline with like you know just fortunes of money right now that they're like what do i do with oh let me throw it in amc stock i don't think that's a situation at all you got a ton of people that still hold stocks like that but in terms of just flooding in money because they magically have a bunch of money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,no that's not the way this works and so in my personal opinion i think that's actually hedge funds playing around and getting a little arbitrage there that's my personal opinion um you know just the numbers you add up the numbers and it's like some of these market caps aren't aren't um small look at amc's market cap i'm telling you man you gotta have some serious dough to push around so they try to pin it on oh it's retail causing the stock to go crazy today or yesterday or whatever right uh i don't know if i believe that i think it's a little hedge fund activity believe me hedge funds they like that money just as much as anybody else,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,and they'll play games own companies with strong fundamentals you want to own companies with good solid cash in their balance sheet not lots of debt because that's a whole other area that we can talk about maybe a different episode is what's going to happen when corporations need to come back for paper uh to fund their balance sheets it's going to be a lot more expensive this time around so those are all things that have yet to come and i think that's coming on the horizon is there a big short in your portfolio now and i'm just saying i'm like relative to other positions you're dating me now not necessarily oh there's one there's one there's one well listen i'll just say listen tesla you know to me is everything about this market that has been wrong it's been bad enforcement by the government capital markets brokers writing research that you know obviously for banking fees and so forth and what is this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,and i want to hear what he has to say but what is the obsess obsession with shorting tesla like why do these guys year after year after year after year try to get this i mean everybody wants to slay the dragon oh my gosh like there's so many i think in my opinion there's always so many short opportunities in the market but why try why try to slay this dragon that has such an incredible brand such an incredible demand an incredible ceo who can you know always puts himself in in kind of the best position even when he seems to put himself in the worst position like what is that level of obsession i just want to understand that and i you know i've been in this stock for so many years and i've just tried to understand that obsession i feel like at some point it's not it's not about even making money i think it's about ego that's what i honestly think it is i think you know everybody wants to be like i shorted tesla and then i went down 50 60,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,whatever and i'm just like of the opportunities you have at your disposal to short what is the obsession and these guys have been doing it for so many years and uh you know the shorts have lost obviously fortunes fortunes on the stock for years and years and years and so i don't know man it's just it's a funny obsession to kind of watch play out it's one of those things if you don't want to hold tesla stock you want to own a fair play but shorting it man oh man he when that thing finally breaks if it ever does and been wrong for a long time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,but when and if and when it does i think we'll know that the market has corrected itself because it has a little bit of everything in this market so this is a short position in your portfolio tesla is a short position what level well off and on broke shorting time absolutely i have not so i made money initially years ago when after the solar city acquisition i thought for you look at this guy look at this guy i mean this is uh look at this guy look at this guy oh the face oh man that's too decade long i've traded i haven't traded as well as i probably should have but uh now i think i'm geared up to a level where i'm very comfortable being short at these levels so okay all right danny good to see you thank you oh gosh i just think about like things that could potentially age bad man i i you know who knows you know obviously if the economy gets much worse uh you know maybe tesla's numbers aren't there over the next let's say year or whatever um it's definitely always a you know a possibility,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,but i just think uh it's one thing to be a little like ah you know i'm not bullish on that stock but it's another to short it it's just in that stock we've just seen the obliteration happen and it's just like i said i think it comes back to ego more than money it really does uh julie beale what do you think particularly about the consumer the the effects yet to come the lag effect of the fed's uh rate hikes yeah i completely agree i think this is the time to be in quality i think from a valuation standpoint the rally that we've seen has really left quality behind and so you can actually find good value there right now for sure i don't want anything that has a lot of leverage i think that's very underappreciated by the market is how many of these companies have either variable rate maturities or maturities that are coming due relatively soon and it's going to be a very different world for them coming back to the capital markets and similarly i think most of these tech businesses that are run by,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,you know young ceos they've never been a manager in a recession they're going to come across a very different world when they can't just get their way out of trouble by buying ping pong tables and beer taps it's it's a new world for them and yeah well i mean i think the quality thing is a really good point i mean danny just said that those names that are going to continue to be crowded in um are going to trade at multiple so if you want to get worried about you know apple at 27 times or whatever it is for like low single digit revenue growth i mean again you know we've all made that case again and again but that stock did sell off 30 or so from its highest the problem is it just rallied back it's down single digits percent on the year and i think you might see uh you know like you might see a lot of those smaller stuff that julie just mentioned that stuff is already down 60 70 80 you know what i mean,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,so i don't just think that they're particularly interesting great point that's a great point he brings out there and it's very important because you hear this all the time oh you want to be in quality and basically what they're talking about is quality is is old established companies that obviously are super profitable and you know apple google uh you know sometimes they throw meta in there amazon uh amazon depends um microsoft like they always throw these sami's x stocks right and uh and maybe some of the coca-cola pepsi's and those sorts of stocks and that's what they kind of always preach because if the market's going up high and let's say the the the more speculative stocks are doing well then a lot of folks on wall street are like oh you don't want to play those they're overvalued but then if they drop massively then they still tell you don't don't get in any of those stocks because it's dangerous so it's just an interesting environment and um you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,yeah a lot of the a lot of the more speculative stocks those stocks have we've seen it man they're down 60 70 80 percent some of them 90 plus right and yeah some of them have come back over the past month but most of them are still down massively so keep that do you think though that we're gonna have an opportunity in the not so distant future where we see some of these big nasdaq names that make up a huge percentage of the major uh large cap indices they're going to show really good relative strength they're going to see all those names that have rallied 30 40 off their lows right that are down 60 70 from their highs they're going to retest those lows really soon and that's going to be the moment of truth for i think for the stock market in general and that's probably going to happen the next few months,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
r8SUuudrP5E,yeah i appreciate that perspective there i'd love to hear your guys opinion on all this as well and uh kind of hear what you guys have to say and your opinion on the whole thing so hope you guys enjoyed this video as always if you're looking to join my private stock group and get access to the private discord chat get access to all my courses which is like dividend investing mastery become a master of the stock market thriving in a recession the millionaire playbook all those sorts of things if you're looking to apply and join us in there check out the pin comment to fill out an application and we'll see if we can get you in there much love as always and have a great day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ, what's going on guys it's Ricky with techbook Solutions and I'm here with my little sister Clarissa my little sister just became an active real estate agent in the Arizona area and she thought it would be fun uh to kind of make a video talking about what's a better investment for 2023 is it real estate or is it investing in the stock market so I really hope that you guys enjoyed this video if you guys do please make sure you guys drop a thumbs up and if you want to see more of these kinds of videos then again make sure you subscribe and comment down below what you guys would like to see next so I'll let you start off um why do you believe that investing in real estate for 2023 is the better way to go so number one I think that real estate is a great investment because historically it actually appreciates over time and of course this depends on the area and local demand levels but you really have a solid appreciation with real estate which I think is great,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,so I think traditionally uh real estate over a long period of time does make a great investment right no question about it I don't see that to be a huge difference from the stock market because traditionally the stock market doesn't matter how bad every crash has been even talking about 2008 eventually it's not an if the market will recover to when right one of the things that I want to talk about is one of the reasons I see the stock market to be a better investment right now is asking how much money do you have to work with right if you're someone that has five ten twenty thousand dollars I mean investing in real estate what can you do with those five ten twenty thousand dollars if you don't have a two year work history to qualify for a property um and all those different other moving parts that you would normally or traditionally need to buy a real estate property right in the stock market I mean you can click the fifth Link in the description of this video download,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,Weeble it's free deposit your funds just like you would with any normal bank account and you can begin to invest in whatever you want obviously with great uh with something being so accessible comes great responsibility but let me ask you this do you know how much Amazon's stuck offers right now in Roi do you know how much Apple stock offers right now in RI do you know how much Tesla stock offers in Roi right now the reason I ask you this is do you think that Apple stock or Amazon stock do you think those companies will fail no okay so if those companies offer right now Amazon let's use that as an example if Amazon stock were to offer over a hundred percent ROI right now why would that not be a better investment than real estate if you have ten thousand dollars yeah ten thousand dollars to work with why would that not be a better investment if markets always recover just like real estate but also just like the stock market markets always recover you just said do you think Amazon stock it's going to go bankrupt,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,no it's probably one of the most valuable companies that's publicly traded it will eventually recover and if previous all-time highs and from the price point route right now I have it right here in the screen just so you can see it it's at 82 dollars a share and if we look at it based off of its current value it's not that it can't lose more of its value right things can always get cheaper just like real estate but based off of previous all-time highs that you see at 188 and at current price levels it offers 128 Ri so my question to you Clarissa is what investment in real estate would offer me or yield me a 128 Roi in 2023. okay well that's a good question I don't you know I know for real estate Investments you do need a lot more money uh down,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,so if you have five thousand dollars to work with you know short-term Investments like stocks are probably going to be better for you but for real estate real estate is a long-term investment and it's one of the safer Investments that you can make uh so if you're wanting to diversify your portfolio and you know add in a long-term investment that is really going to appreciate over time then I would recommend doing real estate and also if you wanted to get into fix and flips like someone I know um that would be able to you know generate income for you at a much faster rate you just have to have that money on hand now one of the things that I want to say on your side um so close at this uh 2022 is her first year becoming a licensed real estate agent so how old are you 21 or 22 22. and again um obviously she has a lot to learn and and the thing that I love about her is that um she's trying right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,she's obviously going to fail a lot but one of the things that I wanted to talk about uh when it comes down to the real estate side is I talked about the stock market where you know if you have five ten twenty thousand dollars what good is that going to do you in the real estate side but if you do have it to your work history if you do have good credit you know there are at least in Arizona a first-time homebuyer programs where you can try to put as as little down as possible right now because it's such a buyer's market now you can ask for sellers concessions right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,so I am also invested in real estate and I also want to talk about the incentives um you know of what might happen in 2023 uh with that being said um even if you do only have 10 or 20 000 depending on the area that you live in you can ask for seller concessions which pretty much means credits uh from the seller to cover your closing costs it can buy down points uh it can make it more affordable for you because if you qualify for the loan all all all you should really be focused on beyond that point is trying to minimize how much money you put into the actual um property itself and by those seller concessions the first time home buyer programs and or just buying a cheaper property where you know 10 or 20 percent is equivalent to the 10 or 20 000 then so be it so I don't want to say that if you only have 10 or 20 000 that it's impossible to buy your first home more now than ever before I think it makes more sense now if you have the money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,no no if it makes more sense now if you have the work history and if you have the good credit and if you have a couple thousand dollars saved to start getting connected with the real estate agent to start looking for deals you will never find and I don't want to say never it will be very challenging to find a good deal in a very bullish Market uh 2021 or very early 2022 I mean properties we're selling above what they were worth and what they were being at to sell for right uh that's that's it was it was an insane time that being said now we've seen this correction you know owners and sellers are getting a little bit more distressed and this is where getting plugged in with a good real estate agent that understands your needs understands what you can afford um and that you're looking for a good deal now is a time where you can really leverage that um where where buyers are actually valued buyers are not valued in a seller's market and that's when property values are selling Beyond ask values,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,so I just wanted to cover that right that you don't need all you don't always need a ton of money there are programs available and I just want to make sure that that's uh spoken about so um the other thing that I want to talk about when it comes down to um the stock market is I use like Amazon stock I used uh Tesla stock a little bit more risky obviously especially with what's been going on uh but even NASDAQ indexes right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,so traditionally when I talk about the market always recovering it's asking yourself a simple question if you're too busy with your job if you feel like you just don't want to over complicate your investing or your Investments a great way to be invested is to be invested in index funds there's three main overall major indexes and that's the NASDAQ that has a big focus on Tech there's the S&P500 which is considered the top 500 most valuable companies that's publicly traded and then there's the Dow Jones which is more on the industrial side of things these indexes when you invest into either the actual ETF itself you're investing in these indexes and whatever they're Diversified in so therefore if markets are down but you want to be Diversified but you don't want to own 50 different stocks then maybe buying an S&P500 Index or ETF fund right an ETF would be a value for you because at that point if you buy like spy that's the S&P500 ETF I can buy spy and when the S&P500 Market goes up then so does Spy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,and I don't have to be invested in 5 10 20 or 500 different Stocks by simply investing in that ETF it at least allows me to be as Diversified as whatever the S&P500 is,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,and it's a great way right just like Warren Buffett says be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful and there's no question that a lot of people are fearful right now and again that's why I think investing in those major indexes is great for long-term investors and why I think real estate is great um is because it provides an inflationary hedge and this is a huge issue right now inflation is through the roof and ongoing increases in inflation tend to cut into earnings generated from most forms of Investments and historically this has not been the case for Real Estate it actually tends to appreciate at a rate faster than inflation which is amazing another point is that real estate can be purchased at below market prices like Ricky was saying uh you know right now is more of a buyer's market so being able to have the sellers pay down your um like seller concessions and that kind of stuff and being able to have more negotiating power as well as not having so much competition with other buyers in the market right now because everyone's so scared is absolutely amazing and having a realtor as an advisor like myself who really specializes in the housing market is absolutely key and I'm being serious I can help you find a good deal for free,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,and I can save you thousands okay and this is for free contact me um yeah so if you are in the Arizona area and you wanted to uh reach out or connect with clear some I'll put her Instagram down below she has a real estate Instagram um but at the end of it I mean if if you don't think you have what it takes to be qualified right now just like when I was first I was back in 2015. I was 20 years old dude I had no idea that I could buy a you know afford to buy a house I remember when I told my parents or I told my friends it just seemed like such a foreign thing right um but even if you can't afford to do it right now or you don't have that to your work history or you don't have that credit score how are you supposed to work towards a goal if you have no plan of action right and regardless I mean with a real estate agent if you choose to go with her or not I personally really don't care um,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,but I think the biggest thing that you need to understand is that if you are actually trying to work towards your goal if your goal for 2023 is hey I want to buy my first investment property I want to buy my first house I want to buy my first rental my first first short-term rental I want to buy my first flip how are you supposed to do any of that if you don't even know what you qualify for and or why you don't qualify so this is something that I encourage for everybody is that get in contact with a good real estate agent get in contact with a good lender and begin to ask those difficult questions it is going to make you feel uncomfortable but you're at least going to know where your credit score is at and what it needs to be you're going to know where your income is at and where it needs to be you're going to need to know what you have saved and what you're going to need to have saved at that point you at least have a road map to get towards your goal and that's one step closer than you were before again people try to over complicate their goals uh but again uh the idea of stress often comes from you know trying to avoid things that shouldn't be avoided um when it comes down one of the last things that I want to say about uh the stock market and why I think um I want to say two last things on why I think it's a better opportunity in 2023 we have seen markets aggressively correct themselves already alone in 2022 real estate traditionally just like the way that it goes up it's more conservative on the way down it's also more conservative so as inflation is rising as interest rates are rising it affects real estate at a much slower pace for the stock market it's instant so the stock market I would say is closer to the bottom than it is to the top real estate we still don't know right and because of things being so ideal for the stock market I would say the best time to prepare for the market to recover is before it actually recovers preparing does not mean that you have to buy or be invested right now just like I said it's about creating a plan of action so understanding that hey when the stock market does begin to recover do you have a trading account open do you have your your funds available in that account do you have your watch list set do you have your alerts head do you know how to buy the stock do you know how to sell it right having that entire understanding of what to do and what not to do prior to the market actually recovering is something that needs to be done in advance and this is why I'm saying for 2023 because of how oversold the markets are even if it takes a little bit longer for markets to recover first thing you can short the market on the way down can you short real estate on the way down you can't no you definitely can't you'll lose money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,right but the great thing about the stock market is if you choose to do it this way is I've had one of my biggest months in the month in the year of 2022 shorting the NASDAQ market so as the market sold off I made money right that's obviously a much more aggressive way to trade in the market but again now is the time markets are very oversold so regardless if you choose to go with the real estate set of things which is more traditional or with the stock market side of the things all I ever encourage any of our beginner investors in whatever Market you choose to partake in is don't bite down more than you can choose or don't bite down more than you can shoot and what I mean by that is pick a market learn about it stay calculated and stay light it doesn't matter if you only buy one share this time buying one share of whatever company you find to be the most valuable is better than buying no shares right I'm tired of you know like all the people that always talk about,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,well you know this year is my year this year is my year 2023 is my year it's like all the people that go to the gym for the first month to two months of of the new year right guess what how many of them are there six or eight months after a very small amount right we all know this about just humans in general do not be someone that sets unrealistic expectations the hardest part is always just getting started so again if you want to open up your trading account it's going to be the fifth Link in the description it is free and if you deposit one dollar it would earn you a total of five to six free stocks just by using my link you get six free stocks I use I get one free stock and again that is the trading application that I use every single day to trade live,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,so if you have any questions before you get started you can shoot me a direct message via Discord and that's that first link in the description or shoot me a direct message via Instagram and that's that third link down below do you have anything else you want to say yes the last thing I wanted to touch on Is that real estate allows for active investment control and most investors simply buy stocks and bonds which typically has a higher risk of them going up and down without them really having any control over the proceeds and this is not the case with real estate because it's a lot more tangible and so as an active investor you're able to search for the best deals control the costs if you're going the rental route you can judge which tenants are going to be good or not,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,and then you're able to decide when you want to sell so by participating in every aspect of the investment process you can impose a lot more control over how much you earn agree to disagree I do agree that because these markets move slower on the real estate side of things yes you do normally have more control but I also know a lot of real estate flippers that sure they calculated a good entry for their price but then markets began to shift as interest rates began to go up and then guess what they lost fifty a hundred thousand dollars and it's not like hey they have more control they can sell at any time no they can't because guess what normally or traditionally it takes 30 to 40 days 45 days for the market uh or for the title companies to close on that property if I'm trying to manage or mitigate my risk in the stock market I can have a stop loss and at one percent I can count losses and it's instant,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,and then I can re-enter a short position so just like anything right you need to be calculated and regardless if you choose something to be a little bit more on the traditional side which I think is a great Outlet even if you choose something to be a little bit more on the risky side which is obviously the stock market just like we talked about do not put yourself in a position in which you cannot tolerate right if you begin investing very heavily in real estate and or very heavily in the stock market at one point or another you're going to bite down more than you can chew,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
CCjWpVGoVyQ,and it's going to be a very uncomfortable experience so again especially as you're just getting started focus on just getting started focusing on what's important and that's actually understanding what you are doing on either side of things so again I appreciate you guys time I hope that you guys enjoyed this video please make sure you drop a thumbs up again if you want to connect with Clarissa I'm going to put your information down below and if you have any questions again you can send me a direct message via Instagram I am verified that's my third link down below that is my only Instagram account every other Instagram account that pretends to be me I can guarantee you is fake I do trade live every single day so I don't just post my profits or my losses but if you actually want to see this happen in real time I do this every single day exclusively for my learn plan profit group and that's that second link in the description down below appreciate your time like always let's make sure that we end the year on our green now take it easy team,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s, and what's gonna everyone I have Nick Palladino here I wanted him to share his experience when it comes down to buy his first home so actually the first time I've ever viewed a property was with Ricky and this was yesterday I just want to say thank you for coming along with this because it made the process a lot better it made me a lot more comfortable I was obviously a little bit nervous going to check out properties for the first time we checked out two yesterday the first one as Riku probably say as well was a little bit different I've never viewed one before in the very first house I ever viewed was the one that was kind of but he's been really quiet it was completely like the real estate agent I don't think communicated with the house owner the individual who you know lived at the house only spoke Spanish and looked like he was like a little a little out of it out of a well days luckily I was able to actually communicate with him since I speak Spanish,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,and we got a little tour of the house you weren't able to check out all the rooms because some of his kids were sleeping in some of the rooms and it was just a very like awkward yeah nicely everything like I didn't even feel like it wasn't even worth it at that point I mean no not at all so to kind of go in a little more depth on that the agent I don't think to be honest with you took me too seriously that's the vibe that I kind of got it was just the communication was lacking for the like he knew I was coming over there like I think I let him know about three weeks prior to this trip specifically I came to visit Arizona to hang out with the guys and go check out properties he never got back to me until yesterday and reset ups I think he said I've just some random properties so the second one I went to was the total opposite of the first one it was very very well done everything was renovated it was pretty much a turnkey move-in ready yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,"so that was a little bit of a better experience it was staged I kind of got an idea on like what to look for Ricky obviously walked me through a lot of this stuff so I'm really glad that I had him there because I don't think the agent was necessarily doing his job so I'm just grateful that obviously you were there when it came down to the kind of impression that I got that real estate agent Nick is not someone that's just randomly looking for houses he got pre-qualified he's been working for the past two years to you know make sure that he can build that to your work history yet your credit over $100,000 Savior I mean he wanted to utilize about $60,000 worth of that you told them kind of the price range of $300,000 in below then that will allow you to work with you know about 20% down as this would be put as an investment property you spoke about your intention of like your from you know and living in California Los Angeles and you want a rental property to create some passive income",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,so I think in the sense of like yes he found some houses near a local university yeah so you can rent it out in that aspect but just with those two houses that were presented the impression that I got was like those were you know polar opposite one was completely you know not moving ready and first of all it was not very professional on how that was handled and the second one was you know a premium priced house when it comes down to an investment property especially with you already telling me that this is that this is not something that you're going to lose it's something that you want to rent out which means that it's for as an investment the house was and he said over ten thousand dollars for the overall market price yeah and it just didn't make sense to me I was just like okay well what are the comps in the area price per square foot,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,and we can see that the house was fully staged that there's you know a lot of money put into that and I think that's great for someone that you know has the intention to move it and you really like you said turnkey ready but it was just so like my mom to me that it was almost like you know a slap in the face to you that like you know you flew all the way from your house Angeles with intention to also check out these properties and for someone to be so unprofessional I think one of the biggest you know pieces of advice even with the real estate agent that you met today who'd you meet up with I met up with Lenny and literally was a night and day difference and a point that I take from that is don't always go with your first option there's always gonna be better options to weigh out your options obviously in this case it was I'm really glad that Ricky was able to set up a phone call with Lenny he set up a phone call literally last night with Lenny this morning,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,Laney and I actually checked out three properties in the same exact area that we checked out yesterday but the houses were pretty much exactly what I was looking for they needed a little bit of work done Ricky as I mentioned we ever mentioned yet but I actually wanted to try to rent him out to students so that was a big thing I wish wanted a house that was kind of tailored to having students lived there and so this house that we specifically looked at today and the one that I am actually trying to move forward with is literally across the street from the campus it's Grand Canyon University it was pretty much already for students it was you can pretty much move students in immediately him showing me houses that were specifically what I was looking for was just kind of like a big relief for me and I'm really excited that I had the opportunity to meet with Lenny and potentially move forward and working with him,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,and I think that's the biggest thing it's like you can tell that the intention with working with Lenny is that he understands you as an investor of what you want what you're looking for that you're not gonna just buy any house because you can rent it out but that you want to find a balance of something that's still a good deal so you have that equity right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,yeah margin profit in the house where if you want it you can sell it for a profit but on top of that as an investor and someone that wants rental income that it also accommodates that you know student type of housing I mean being across the street from you know rent in University I think is a night and day difference one of my biggest takeaways at least from like watching this I've seen this happen is that you want to make sure that your real estate agent is someone that's knowledgeable and that someone understands you know what your intentions are when it comes down to buying this property if you're buying this property you know as a primary residence you're going to live in it and you still want to get deal but make sure that they know that and that all the listings that they provide for you are of that in a sense criteria it was just so much wrong and again the guy that we met up with that he just was kind of just like yeah check out these to be properties didn't really tell us much about it I think money does a great job work when he shows you a house he already knows and doesn't delegate,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,yeah that's that's the thing that's like he has experience he's done his due diligence and making sure that he's doing his part as a real estate agent to make sure that he gets you the best year possible and not just so focused on let me tell ya trying to sell you a house like he's he definitely I can tell was looking out for my best interest which was pretty much the best the best feeling for me was to know someone was gonna be working for me not just trying to sell a house real quick get their commissions that it's that reassurance that you guys both have yeah I mean you're you're motivated to buy a house but that the intentions allowing yeah and I that's the thing too it's like I'm this is just gonna be like my first property but this is something I want to do long-term so like having knowing Lenny that he has my back Ike,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,I want to continue working with him after this if this all goes through it's like I have like Ricky said I have a hundred thousand saved up comfortably to invest in I didn't want to tie up all one hundred thousand and one property what I wanted to do was go 20% down with about 40 to 50 even 60 thousand dollars and I can still have that forty fifty thousand dollar cushion if I found another property later on so someone I wanted to find someone that it's not just this one house but someone I can do long-term business with and I think money's like the perfect person after just meeting him talking on the phone I can tell that he has my best interest yeah and I think that's a great thing about this is a you know finding your lend use in your area right yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,well that have the best interest for you and that are motivated to not only just potentially you know get your business once but someone that you can work with I think after this experience that you had with funny this is something that you said that you can see yourself doing for you know the rest of your life beyond something that you know you want to build a team around and it's great to have someone that you know can almost be viewed as a mentor mentor yeah exactly Antonio when it comes down to buying your first house am I putting myself back in that situation when it came down to making offers making offers is like the easy part you have but then once you understand that like wow for the next 30 years I am like you know in on this loan and to me you know hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in a house it was just so my boy I'm so young I was like do I really want that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
sBn3rk2r19s,"yeah 30 years it's like I'm 20 years old like 25 and for the next 30 years it's like more than we'd like yeah this moment and it's a very overwhelming type of experience but having people that are experienced and that you feel comfortable with working with I think can make the overall experience that much more enjoyable overall you know much more successful as well alright guys thank you guys again so much for watching feel free to drop your thoughts in the comment section if you guys want to connect with Nick I'm gonna put his first link in the description for his YouTube channel amazing content he has over 67,000 subscribers when it comes down to fitness and nutrition really do you appreciate ya this time hope we earned your thumbs up and like always let's make sure that we in the year not agree now take it easy team see you guys",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
psGxIB7H20o,there are a number of different reasons why people fail when trying to invest and trade in the forex market and other financial markets on their own in today's video we'll be talking about one of the main reasons why traders fail one of the main reasons why traders stay confused about which direction the market may go and I'm gonna give you guys a solution to that problem so we're gonna go over some really important stuff in today's video if you're new here to the trading channel and you enjoy educational content like this then make sure you go ahead and click that subscribe button and click the notification bell so that you stay alerted whenever we come out with new videos each and every week if you would like some other free educational content from us then head over to www.fcsexcel.com to [Music] so in order to give you guys the reason that a lot of traders fail I'm actually gonna do some analysis here on the pound dollar first and there's a really good reason why I'm doing this and why I picked this pair what we're gonna do is take a look at the pound dollar and I'm gonna give you guys two separate entry reasons in opposite directions and the reason I'm doing this is to prove to you that in almost any situation in any market you can find reasons to go long and you can find reasons to go short so let's go ahead and do that here on the pound dollar so here on the 4-hour chart of the pound dollar what do we have we have a market that has found a new Uptrend right we came from these lows here up to a ha new higher low new higher ha new higher low new ha ha train continuation traders what are we expecting well we're expecting a pullback into one our most previous level of resistance that was broken to down here at our level of support one of those two areas would be great areas to look for support and to look for a reason to enter going long right well what if I told you that was just as good of a reason to go short here on this pair so let's drop it down to a one-hour chart to look at this here on the one-hour chart what do we have for bring on it your RSI indicator you can see that we have one top followed by a double top with RSI divergence and a break through the neckline,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
psGxIB7H20o,so why do I bring this up well because there are probably a number of traders looking for this pull back up into the neckline of that double top and a reason to go short on this pair there are also a number of traders looking for a long trade from this area of resistance that was most previously broken now which one of these is the correct way to trade which one of these is the right thing to do the answer is both and neither and I know that sounds really confusing but let me explain a little bit about why that's the case the reason that most traders get so confused when trying to trade in financial markets is because they're looking for all these different reasons they're looking for ok we're in an uptrend boom and now I'm waiting on this pullback into this area but wait we just ran into a level of resistance and what if this level resistance pushes the market down then that means this long trades a bad idea right but what if the market goes up and I don't trade right here I'm gonna feel terrible,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
psGxIB7H20o,so what do I do in the answer to that question of what do I do should be extremely simple let me tell you why that should be simple a lot of traders that I've come in contact with it throughout my teaching career and a lot of other traders that I know that have failed when trying to trade did so because of the fact that they did not have rules the answer to that question of should I go long here or should I be going short because of this double top on the one-hour chart should I be going long because of the pullback into previous resistance the answer to that question should be very very easy for you to define based on your rules as a trader at any moment in the market there are reasons to go long and there are reasons to go short the only thing that separates which one of those decisions is right for you as a trader is the rules you have set in a trading plan or in a certain strategy that you're using and this is the secret guys having those rules will one give you a greater chance of success in any financial market not just Forex and to keep you from being confused about market direction because if you have the correct rules in place market direction is going to be less important because here again we're running into resistance we have a double top on the 1 hour time frame RSI divergence right here at resistance we could see the market fall from this level as traders none of us know that that's not what becoming successful is about you're not going to know exactly what the markets going to do we also have trained continuation the market just broke into new highs and has now pulled back into the previous level of resistance which we know can be a highly accurate place to take long trades from an expectation for trend continuation which one of those is right and which one of those is the correct trade is completely up to you and your trading plan and this is why it's so important to have a trading plan to have rules in your trading so you're not confused about what to do every time you see a market in this type of situation and this is another reason why that in my opinion anyone who's new to trading needs to pick one of two ways they're going to trade either trade as a counter trend trader or trade as a trend continuation trader this is what I wish I would have known whenever I first started because whenever first started this was me I was looking at a chart finding 15 reasons to go short and 15 reasons to go long and just guessing picking which one I thought was a better reason to go short or long when in reality I should have picked either being a counter trend trader or a trend continuation trader because look how simple it becomes if that's the case if you're a trend continuation trader you're not looking right here on the one-hour chart at least and maybe a higher time frame you're looking there for a trade but let's not get into that that could get really confusing and it's a little more advanced than I like to get into here on YouTube but let's say you're a trained continuation trader you're not even going to be paying attention to this double-top whatsoever what you're waiting for is your rules to be met for the breaking close above your previous level of resistance and your rules to be met for entry in trend continuation if those rules consist of a pullback into resistance then that's what you're waiting on and your entry reason to go long you no longer have to be confused about market direction or what you think the markets going to do when you have a set of rules that tell you what to do follow your rules not your emotions and the same thing goes for counter trend trading guys let's say you pick counter trend trading instead of trend continuation to be what you want to use in your trading plan,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
psGxIB7H20o,well what you would be looking for let's say this is part of your rules is for a market to come up to previous structure resistance while in an uptrend and then put in this double top right double top RSI divergence may be your entry reason is on the completion to that double top maybe it's after the break of the neckline and the point is not what your strategy is the point is that you have a strategy you have rules based around previous structure levels that's either counter trend or trend continuation and they can be based around anything else as well I just trade around structural eyes the reason I use these two things as an example but you can definitely use indicators and anything else you're accustomed to in order to create these strategies the most important thing is that you have rules in place to help you to dismiss some of the confusion about which direction the markets going to go mostly because as traders we do not have the luxury of knowing which direction the markets going to go if someone were to ask me Stephen do you think this market is going up from here or that we're going to continue lower after this double top I would have absolutely no problem telling that person I don't really know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
psGxIB7H20o,and that doesn't mean I'm at trading that's just the reality of what we do nobody really knows what the markets going to do which direction it's going to go but what we can do and what gives us an advantage is creating a rules-based strategy that gives us an edge over the market creating a set of rules that gives us let's say a 60 to 70 percent chance of winning at rate or that gives us a 50 percent chance with a two-to-one risk reward if we create a set of rules that give us those kind of odds every time we place a trade then that's the path to success the path to success is doing that not knowing which direction the markets going to go all the time so that was a brief video guys own rules based trading I really hope that it was helpful for your trading I was actually gonna break down the pound dollar a little bit further with you guys but we've already pointed out two of the main trading possibilities here on this pair for trading continuation traders if you have this in your trading plan then right now where the market is previous structure resistance is going to be a good place for you to look for possible long opportunities again if that's in your trading plan and if you're a counter trend trader we have just had this double top push down break of the neckline maybe your trading plan says to wait for a pullback into that neckline before you go short or possibly you're already short from here either way just making sure you're following your rules this has been Steven you're honest trading coach giving you a nugget of knowledge that I've learned in my trading career I hope it's beneficial and helpful to you if you're a beginner or more advanced in your trading career and you would like to invest in your trading education then we have much more advanced training that goes over strategies rules-based trading risk management discipline and everything you need in order to go from where you are and help you own your path to becoming profitable as a trader all of that can be found on the trading channel net and there's also a link in the description to our flagship program which is the EAP training program and of course I don't want you to have to take my word for that program being good I'm a bit bias but take a look at some of the testimonials we've had from other traders that have been through the program already and if you're ready to take the next step towards trading success then just click the link in the description labeled EAP training program if you're new here to the trading channel again make sure you're subscribed here click the notification bell to make sure you're alerted whenever we come out with new educational content just like this each and every week I'm there's been some wind noise in this video the audio could be a little bit messed up because of that my desk is actually right beside a window and we're having some pretty bad storms in the area that I live right now so sorry about that if that interrupted do you think throughout the video I try to edit as much as I can out of this video but as I said there's some pretty bad storms going on right now in my area and my desk is right beside a window so sorry about that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

9Zyde4d1zo8,and although that is true that's not the similarity I'm talking about the similarity I'm talking about makes them all good possible buying opportunity candles and if you haven't spotted it yet don't worry this video is going to talk about candlestick chart secrets one of them being this insanely accurate candlestick pattern that I'm going to show you in this video so we're gonna start the video in just a second with I'm gonna teach you what a candlestick is for those of you who are brand new at trading this will help and I'm gonna show you what each of them mean after that we're gonna dive into this incredible candlestick pattern I'm gonna show you exactly how to spot it then I'm gonna show you how to combine it with other things in order to trade it we're gonna take a look at some examples and we'll take a look at some back tested data of a strategy I've already tested in historical data so we're gonna get through all that in today's video go ahead and click that subscribe button down below the video to the right hand side click that like button for me to help out with the YouTube algorithm follow us over on Instagram at the trading channel and I'll see you after the intro and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,disclaimer [Music] welcome back guys let's dive right into today's content so for those of you who are brand new at trading I'm gonna go through quickly what a candlestick is and what they represent and those of you who have already been trading for a while and you already understand these concepts there'll be a timestamp in the description to take you straight to the candlestick pattern I'm going to be teaching you today but for those of you who are new let's go ahead and get started right here we have daily chart candles you've seen these before they're normally green and red,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,but what do they actually mean well these candlesticks are nothing more than a representation of price moving over a certain period of time a daily chart would be a representation of a full day of price if this was a one-hour chart and not a daily chart it would be a representation of one day of price and what they need to be recognized as is with a green candle the green candle normally represents an update meaning that this area here is the open the bottom of the body is the open this here is the low it is the low point of the pot of the candle the bottom of that wick is the low point of this 24-hour period represented by our green candle this high point is the high of this 24-hour period and this is the close of that candle so if this candle would have started at 5:00 p.m. and then ended at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time then this is exactly what it would look like if we had an open here price moved down from our open to our low price then moved back up to our high and then price came back down and finally closed right here that is exactly what these candlesticks mean that's a great presentation of a green candlestick or a positive day in price if you're looking at a daily chart a negative day is shown by this red candle here so on this red candle we have a very similar setup except instead of the bottom of the body being to open on a red candle the top of the body is the open the top of this wick is still the high of this candle the bottom wick is still the low of this candle and the bottom of the body is the close of this candle so in the representation of this candle what we would have seen if we were watching this on a daily chart is this candle would have opened here it then went to pushed up to the high and then pushed all the way down to the low and then eventually pushed back up to close that 24-hour period right there at the bottom of this red candle so that's how you see a candlestick and that's how that's how you break down the anatomy of each and every one of these candlesticks it represents a certain amount of time depending on the time period your own everything would be exactly the same if this was one hour instead of daily this was one hour then that would still be the exact same anatomy of a candlestick so now that we've broken debt that down a little bit let's head down to a different white screen and take a look at the four green candles we were looking at right at the intro of the video so now can you spot the similarities of any of these right now what I'm gonna do is go ahead and tell you the similarity and teach you the candlestick pattern that I never hear talked about here on YouTube and that I think is one of the most accurate candlestick patterns you can use for a buying trade and that is each one of these candles closes in the top 95% of the candle each one of these candles has either a tiny wick on it or no wick on the top at all and with these being green candles what that means is that the end of whatever time period let's just say we're still on the daily for simplicity at the end whatever time period we are looking at this candle closed nearly at its high at the highest point that the participants of the market pushed this candle it dropped barely any which means there was not many sellers at the end of this candle at the end of this period if we have little to no wicks on the top of these candles that means there were no sellers at the end of this period so that gives us a good representation that we could possibly see a market head higher from a candlestick like this and the way I defined this whenever I'm trading on a 4-hour chart I'm mostly trade on for hour and you can set a Fibonacci retracement like this let me go and show you how to identify the candle so you can take a Fibonacci retracement let me put it on my candle you can then adjust your Fibonacci retracement number change it to 0.05 percent and now all you have to ask yourself is did this candle you pull a retracement from the low of the candle to the the candle did this candle land the body of the candle close above the top 5% of the candle and if the answer is yes then you have a correct candlestick formation and as you can tell each of these do that so that's one way to spot this gamma stick pattern what I do is just look for the market to only have a 5 pip wick at the top of the candle or less 5 to 6 fifths is the max so a max 5 to 6 pip wick on the top of the candle when I'm trading on a 4-hour chart but you can also use the Fibonacci tool that might make it a little bit easier for you like I said grab your Fibonacci tool with the correct setting of a 5% top 5% of the candle and then there we have it every time you want to see if you are trading the correct pattern you can just use the Fibonacci tool and make sure that that candlestick closed in the top 5% and again if it did close in that top 5% then chances are there was no buying meaning excuse me there was no selling pressure at the end of that time period so chances are there's gonna be buying pressure in the next period and that's what makes this candlestick pattern so powerful now let's move on to actually finding a few of these on sharp data and then I'll teach you a full strategy you can actually test and show you my back testing data of that strategy right after we go over this candlestick pattern on actual charts see you in just a second,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,alright so what I want you to do right now is see if you can spot a few of these candlestick patterns and by the way they have to be green it has to be a green candle that closes in the top 95% see if you can spot any of them on the chart all right do you got it let's circle a few of them here we have a candle that closes in the top 95 percent the market pushes higher and by the way I'm going to teach you a bearish version of this as well this is exactly what I'm talking about we have a bearish candle now that closes in the bottom 5% of this candle with that being the case this would also be a trade so I'm going to point it out but I'm gonna teach you the bearish version which is exactly the same but flipped,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,but I'll go over it anyway in just a second we have the market pushing down then we have what another one of these candlesticks that I'm gonna call the 5% candle because it closes in the top 5% of the candle itself we have a green candle closing in the top 5% that's called a 5% candle and these are just three examples of them actually on the chart so now let's take a look at the bearish version of this all right so now I want you to see if you can spot any of the bearish versions of this same exact 5% candlestick pattern did you spot this one here at the top we have one here let's keep looking I'll Circle it one there market Falls you have another one here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,market continues to fall we have another one here market continuing to fall another one here market continuing to fall and guys it's not like this is some type of another one here market Falls again this is not some type of Holy Grail candlestick pattern if you go out and just trade every one of these it'll be very hard to consistently make profit but imagine adding some other indications like structure like trend like indicators in with this and imagine how powerful it can be and that's actually when I show you right now is how powerful this type of pattern can be this 5% candlestick pattern can be when you start adding other factors into it and create an actual strategy around it instead of just looking at it as a candlestick pattern this candlestick pattern is not the Holy Grail it has losses you will see times when the market prints this candle and then goes higher just like anything else in trading but if you can combine the right conditions to this it can provide a very accurate trading strategy or a very accurate way to enter a trading strategy so let's go ahead and go over a trading strategy you can use with this right now all right so now let's talk about a full strategy using this candlestick pattern as I said before having a single candlestick pattern will never make you a profitable trader you're not gonna win tons of trades just trading a single candlestick pattern what you have to do is use that candlestick or that candlestick pattern as a reason for entry combined with other factors those other factors can include indicators structure with the underlying trend whatever you want the other factors to be is fine but in today's video and for this particular strategy we're gonna be using the RSI indicator and this is a very very simple strategy by the way my RSI is set to a period or length of 10 that's the only thing I've changed is that it is a 10 period RSI so with this 10 period RSI what we're looking for we already know the candlestick formation we're looking for right that 5% can we need a candle that's going to close in the top 5% of a green candle or the bottom 5% of a red candle and what we're gonna do is we're gonna look for this in extended markets so what we want to see is an overextended market the way we're defining that is with an oversold RSI on our RSI 10 period,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,so if we have the RSI going into oversold right about here's where we do this is when I'm gonna start looking for a green 5% candle so at this point as we go into oversold I want to start looking at my candlesticks and see if I get a green candle that closes in the top 5% of that candle do you guys see the one I ended on right here this would be the entry candle,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,so that's the only criteria for the strategy I'm about to show you the results of this back test and we'll go over the strategy a little more but remember what we're looking for is extended markets overextended markets so if a market goes into oversold we're using at in period RSI a market goes into oversold while the market is oversold or either coming out of oversold we want the market to do that with one of these 5% candles and I'll go ahead and go over these stops and targets for this and EAP members I have a full strategy I'm working on with this for you guys here on YouTube I'm gonna give you a explanation of how you can develop a strategy using this and I'm going to share with you the back testing results I have here on the pound candidate before our stops and targets I did 10 pips below the swing low so we have 27 to the swing load would be 37 and I just one point 4 to 1 risk reward,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,so I bring this down to 1 point 4 you can see that we hit that right here on this candle so that was a winning trade and what I'll do is go ahead and put another arrow on this and now I want to show you guys the results of this so if i zoom the chart out you'll see red and green lines here and we're gonna go over a short version of this in just a second bearish version of it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,but if i zoom the chart out these are my wins and losses Green is a win red is a loss I tested this from 2018 and with that test from 2018 until today's date with this using the same exact rules that I just taught you and we're gonna go over a short example in just a second we'll go over a bearish example but using those same criteria with the RSI set to attend period and waiting for it to go oversold or overbought and then waiting for that 5% candle to pop us out of over solar overbought conditions using that same criteria we produced 57 wins and 30 losses a total of 80 trades giving a 65% chance of winning and this is all with a one to one this wasn't quite a one point four to one but that is an incredible win rate for just using overbought and oversold trades with a simple candlestick pattern like this 5% candlestick and that's one of the reasons that I absolutely love this candlestick pattern guys here is a over bolt situation we have a market coming into overbought,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,we come into overbought back here actually we don't have remember when we get into overbought we're looking for a red candle that closes in the bottom 5% of that candle we don't have that anywhere we don't have that here to candle this green lines over you actually cannot see that right here is when we get it notice what price does once we get that candlestick pattern coming out of our / vault situation we have a major push down so for a sell trade we would just be waiting on the market that come into overbought using our RSI 10 period and then we would be waiting on this bottom 5% red candle this 5% red candle would be the entry stop 10 pips above the swing high which would be over here so it'd be 10 perps above this target whatever you want to use this targets one two one one point four two one one point five two one three two one totally up to you but that is a look at how you can use the 5 percent candle to build an actual strategy and to build an actual trading plan alright,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,so I really hope you enjoyed that beginner lesson,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,but if you are ready for some more advanced training then we just had a few graduates out of the EAP training program our flagship program here at the trading channel I'll post some of their testimonials on the screen and that is incredible news for them and that's also incredible news for you because that means that we finally have some spots available in the EAP training program and while you glanced through some of the comments on the screen I want to tell you that if you're struggling to profit right now then I've been where you are too I struggled for over a year before I found a way to be consistently profitable I made every mistake you can think of I've moved stops I used poor risk management I've traded strategies that didn't work I followed a signal service that ended up with me almost blowing my entire account but after that first year and after nearly blowing an entire account I found the real path to trading success and consistently profitable trading became as easy as counting to 6 and that is what I teach in the EAP training program I created a strategy that only uses six simple rules to create an edge over the market so once you memorize these rules trading becomes as easy as counting to 6 these rules are completely objective and easy to follow and although just having a strategy is only one part of the equation it is a very large part of that equation in the EAP training program we also have lessons on risk management and discipline to make sure that you have everything you need to get on the right track to becoming a consistently profitable trader and here's a look at some of the things that are included in the course as you can see we have beginner lessons that teach you everything you need to know about technical analysis in terms of what you're gonna learn in the course we have a transition course which is meant to take you from where you are to becoming consistently profitable and after that we have an advanced course that is meant to take your trading to that next level we also send out three to five email alerts every week these are not meant as signals let me clarify that but instead made to show you exactly how I am looking at the market and we also do a review video at the end of every couple of weeks to show you how the strata these are performing and you can check those out right here so if more advanced training is something that you are looking for then we do have a few spots available in the EAP training program this program also comes with priority email meaning you can email me at any point that you have questions and I will answer you ASAP so if a trading mentor is something you are looking for then look no further go and click the link in the description for the EAP training program and it would be a pleasure to have you aboard and to have you join us in the EAP training program if not that's totally fine too make sure you're subscribed here on YouTube make sure to click that like button for me if you enjoyed this video follow us on instagram at the trading channel and i will see you in the next video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
9Zyde4d1zo8,[Music] you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c, what if the only thing missing in your trading was a concept so simple so easy to understand that it can be taught in less than a 10 minute video welcome to the trading channel if you are new make sure you click that subscribe button and the notification bell down below the video to be alerted when we come out with new educational content about Forex each and every week if you're a returning subscriber welcome back make sure you click that like button for me while the intro and disclaimer roll and when we get back we'll talk about this one simple concept that causes most traders to fill that you're going to learn in less than 10 minutes,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,[Music] before we get into this concept that we're gonna be talking about today I'm gonna take you through a couple of different currency pairs that we were looking at earlier in the week show you guys how the analysis has played out and also what we're looking for now based on the way those markets have moved since our analysis earlier this week on the pound dollar earlier in the week we talked about this pair coming down into a major level of support we said it was likely this pair would hit around the 127 even handle number and I'll actually let me play a clip of that really quick it's gonna be a very short clip I'll be right back we are in a period of consolidation as you can see the markets not in any type of clear trend so that discounts having a bias on the lower timeframe,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,so right now we can't say whether we have a short bias or a long bias based on the analysis that I personally use the technical analysis I personally use when trading right now all I can trade personally is support and resistance levels major support and resistance levels like the one that the pound dollar is on its way down to seemingly we're going to hit one point two six nine eight if we do for me personally this is going to be a good place to look for some possible counter-trend bounce up to the next major level of structure being at one point to 803 so this is a possible area where I'll be looking to get a possible around 100 pip bounce out of this market for a counter-trend play here on the pound dollar okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,so as you saw in that clip we were expecting this market to come down into the 1.27 area and we were expecting about a hundred pit bounce out of the market after touching that area what's happened so far on the pound dollar let's go ahead and zoom down to a smaller time frame currently we have gotten no reason for entry here on this currency pair when it comes to being in this zone because that's what it takes to create a strategy create a trading plan we're not just entering RAM randomly at significant levels of structure we're actually waiting for entry reasons waiting for specific strategies to come together at these specific levels here we are only hourly chart and let's actually check since hitting the 127 area go and grab a ruler tool this market is pushed up 50 pips about half of what we expected so what does that mean well that means that based on the analysis we've done through historical data and the analysis we've done in the past based on that we could see higher bounce out of this market we could see the pound dollar do something like this or a even better situation that we're actually waiting for here at the trading channel is a retest of this 127 level and it's very specific entry reason right here at this level to go long in anticipation for the rest of that 100 pip move,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,so what are we looking at now here on the pound dollar we're actually just waiting on a double bottom at this very specific level of structure that we pointed out earlier in the week based on major support looking out on the daily charts let's check that daily chart once more to show you guys what I'm talking about this level of support you can see has pushed the market up multiple times in the past coming down into that level once more I don't know that it's going to necessarily create a big uptrend like it as these previous two times and I'll show you guys why that's the case why that's my belief as well as you can see the first time we bounced off 127 the market jumped up a significant amount the second time we jumped up a little bit less this time we could quite possibly jump up a little bit less maybe come up to this trendline before pushing down but what I do know is that this level should give some type of balance and we've already got a 50 pit bounce out of this level but what I would really expect from this level is something around 100 pips of a bounce maybe even a bounce up the 128 level at around that 100 pip mark and that's exactly what we're expecting so based on what we're expecting based on that predictive analysis we're gonna be waiting for a double bottom on the lower timeframe there on the pound dollar now another pair that we were taking a look at that has done something interesting is the Aussie dollar on the Aussie dollar we were saying earlier in the week that we wanted to see a close above this previous level of resistance that's exactly what we got we'll go down to a smaller time frame to show you guys what we're waiting on now let's drop down to is let's say a four-hour chart on this four-hour chart the red area we have highlighted here is going to be that very specific zone of structure that likely area for great trading opportunities so we're waiting on the Aussie dollar to get into that area and provide some type of entry reason to go long based on our structure analysis and our trend analysis out on higher time frames the daily chart,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,so that's what we're expecting out of these two currency pairs now let's get into the real subject matter of today's video the real subject matter of today's video is a concept that's extremely simple yet 99% of traders do not understand it or implement it into their trading and that causes most traders to either blow their account or completely stop trading what is this concept this concept is risk management and risk management consists of about three major parts what are these three parts well it starts with risk capital then risk per trade and overall exposure is the third these three concepts are going to play a major part in your trading and will play a major part in your trading success let me explain a little bit about why you see most traders that fail start out and do something like this let's say you start trading because you anticipate creating massive wealth from trading from the beginning you just anticipate that you're gonna put money in the market and that money's gonna multiply over and over and over every time you place its rate,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,and what you have to do in order to understand risk capital is really sit and think about what is an amount of money you're willing to risk trading remember we're not we're in a career where there's like a 90 percent fail rate so it's quite likely that you will lose some or all of your initial investment whenever you first start trading especially as a beginner and especially without understanding the concepts of risk management so we have a new trader he starts trading right let's say he allocated 100 percent of his net worth he allocated every bit of his savings account to trading now he jumps in the market he expects to win every trade he traits 10 different trades because he saw a very nice-looking strategy on YouTube somewhere so he takes the next 10 trades he sees based on what he thinks that strategy is he loses six of them he doesn't understand risk management and risk capital he's risking a little bit more than he should per trade he loses 60% of his total account value that trader is almost done with trading in only 10 trades because of this concept of non understanding risk capital he saw 60% of his net worth in 10 trait that is something you want to avoid at all costs so first step to understanding and implementing risk management into your trading something that's massively important and that can keep you from being the 90% of traders that fail is understanding risk capital and only allocating an amount of money that you are comfortable if lost to trading because again guys we're in a career where there's a 90% fail rate especially when you first start out there's pretty likely chance you'll lose some or all of your initial investment so keep that in mind when starting a trading camp that's the first step of risk management let's move on to step number two risk per trade step number two is risk per trade let's go back to the same example a trader that takes ten trades right he takes ten trades and loses let's say six out of the ten and loses 60% of his total account value based on that because maybe he was risking 10 12 percent of his total account every single time he placed a trade now this is how a lot of traders start most traders when they begin in a trading career are there not to protect their account not to manage risk most traders go into it trying to make as much money as possible and while wealth can be created from trading and making as much money as possible is important but as much money as possible has to come with the correct risk management otherwise you will never last in this game you have to start your account with an appropriate amount based on your risk tolerance that's risk capital after that you have to be risking a very small percentage of that account per trade and that has to be something you're comfortable with as well take the same trader for example or actually let's do a new example let's take a strategy that's about 60 percent accurate and based on the strategy has a series of five losses in a row so in that exact position with five losses in a row let's say that's the maximum drawdown as those five losses in a row for this specific strategy what if you were risking 5% of your total account value every single trade those five losses in a row would create a 25% drawdown now you have to ask yourself are you comfortable losing 25% of your total account or do you need to risk less a lot of times the number is thrown around that 2% of your total account value is the maximum amount you should ever risk on a trade,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,well I would agree that that is the maximum amount you should risk I think that 2% is way too hot for someone who is just starting out and I am in no way telling you what you should risk I'm not a financial adviser make sure to do your own due diligence whenever it comes to figuring out your own risk tolerance and what an acceptable amount of for you to risk per trade actually is and what an acceptable amount of risk capital is for you but when it comes to risk per trade you need to think about it in terms of drawdown and not in terms of your potential return on investment I made this mistake earlier in my trading career I would look at a strategy and I would look at the ROI and go,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,"oh my gosh I could use this strategy for the next 12 months and make a thousand percent in 12 months and what I wasn't paying attention to is that little section on my spreadsheet that said drawdown you see over the next 12 months I could make a thousand percent it's possible but 10 my emotions handle the 45 55 percent drawdown that comes with imagine starting an account with let's say ten thousand dollars and within the first six months you're down five grand I've had a drawdown lasts a very long time I've had one last six months let's go three months because I have had draw downs last three months so let's say in the first three months with this $10,000 account you're risking way more than you should per trade and you have a 50% drawdown in three months how likely are you to continue trading that strategy trading based on the rules that you use to continue staying disciplined after losing 50% of your total accountability pretty unlikely",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,right I would have to agree so the way to figure out your wrist portrayed this comes with a lot of work you have to create your rules based strategy back test that strategy through historical data see the expected ROI and drawdown of that strategy in it to adjust your risk per position until that drawdown number hits a number that you're actually comfortable with and that's something you'll have to do on your own but that is the second step to risk management which is risk portrayed now the third step to risk management is overall exposure overall exposure for me personally the way I manage risk in the way I trade is with a risk per position some people do it based on a lot size that's not the way I manage risk I manage risk through risk per position so for me overall exposure is the amount of trades I can be in at once and it is percentage base so personally I don't like having more than 6 percent of my total account ever exposed in the market at once,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
TSxquI6ac3c,right I don't want to be in more than three trades at a time if I'm risking 2% per trade six trades at a time if I'm risking 1% per trade I don't want to ever risk more than 6 percent of my total account value at any one given time based on the amount of trades I'm in and based on my risk per position so that is an overview of maximum exposure another number you need to sit and think hard about before you implement it into your risk management plan so guys as you can see those are the steps that create a positive risk management plan a risk management plan that can help you create trading success and the question you have to ask yourself is have you actually done this for yourself if not it could be a massive reason that you're struggling to create trading success as a special thank you to you for being a part of the community here at the trading channel and also for making it the end of this video I'm actually gonna do something really special you see in order to create a proper risk management plan you have to have a spreadsheet capable of making the necessary calculations in order to calculate your winning percentage and to calculate your maximum drawdown that is essential when it comes to the process of creating a risk management plan doing all of that manually would take a massive amount of time so in order to help you shave that time off and again as a special thanks for making it at the end of this video and for being a part of the community here at the trading channel what I'm gonna do is over the next few days only this is a very limited opportunity I'm gonna give you my spreadsheet that I use personally and you can see it on the screen in front of you now that it is capable of making these capulet calculations for absolutely free you can find that link in the description labeled free spreadsheet so go ahead and click that and I'll see you guys over on the spreadsheet mastery course which is a full training we do on how to build a spreadsheet and again along with that you'll have the opportunity to actually download the spreadsheet itself as well for free only for the next few days though so go ahead and click the link in the description also if you enjoyed today's video as always make sure you click that like button for me if you are new here and you haven't subscribed yet go ahead and click the subscribe button and the notification bell share this video with anyone who needs help when it comes to the risk management section of their trading which I would imagine is a few traders that you know so make sure shares video as well and I will talk to you guys,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

N-l9a4BmU4Q, what's up traders stephen here your honest trading coach and today i want to show you a strategy that since 2015 has not lost one of its trades i'm talking a 100 winning percentage since 2015 and then i'm going to tell you why you should not necessarily be trading that strategy i know it sounds confusing now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,but i promise by the end of the video you're going to completely understand what i'm saying and i'm also going to show you a strategy that has about a 70 chance to win that you are much more likely to make money on and i'm going to give you the reasons why so if that sounds like something that'll be interesting for you go ahead and click that like button to help out with youtube algorithm go ahead and subscribe because we come out with content like this each and every week make sure to click that notification bell so you're notified when we do so and go ahead and follow us over on instagram at the trading channel for more content and i'll be right back to share with you a strategy that's won 100 percent of its trades since 2015. see you in a second [Music] welcome back guys the first thing we're gonna do is dive into the strategy itself and i'm gonna teach you the strategy that's won every single trade that it's had since actually 2005. i was mistaken in the intro it's since 2005.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,as you can see we are on the new zealand yen chart we're on the daily chart and we're at 7 11 of 05. i'm just going to teach you the strategy because it will take less than 60 seconds it's super simple i call it the 100 200 strategy what i'm looking for with this strategy is 100 candles 100 bars that have not touched the 200 period moving average black line is 200 ema which stands for exponential moving average price the bars are the bars right we need 100 bars that did not touch the 200 ema that's condition number one for this strategy and in case you're wondering if i count every single bar i do not if you have a ruler tool like i do here on trading view it's right here this tool will let you count bars or pips up and down it lets me count bars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,so i just grab the latest bar before the touch of the 200 scroll back until i have 100 bars and if out of that 100 bars we have not touched the 200 period moving average then i know my rule is met so first two rules are already there the next thing we're waiting on is a touch of the 200 ema either that touch being with a wick or the body of a candle so going back we have a hundred bars that have not touched the 200 ema we then have a test of the 200 ema and our entry reason is a close above candle which only means we have a candle that closes above the high of the previous candle like you can see right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,so that was our entry reason on this specific trade now the context of this strategy is very simple to understand if we've been above the 200 period moving average for 100 days in this case for 100 bars then we're in an uptrend right we're in an uptrend there's no doubt about it and what we're waiting on is a very deep retracement of that uptrend to hit the 200 ema and we're buying a close above candle off of that since 2005 this strategy has not lost here on the new zealand yen but there's a big part of strategies that almost no one thinks of i didn't think of when i was starting out my trading career,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,and that's something we're going to talk about in just a second let's go through the trades we've had since 2005 on the new zealand yen and let's see if you notice the reason that even though this strategy has won 100 percent of its trades since o5 see if you can spot the reason that we don't necessarily need to try to trade this strategy so let's go ahead and move the chart forward here we have another situation we can count all these bars i'll do this one more time with you we have 100 bars we actually have 100 and right at 14 bars as you can see right here this means we have 114 bars from the bar i started on that little green candle to this red candle the bar i ended on so at 114 bars that's over 100 bars that have not touched the 200 ema at all no wicks have touched it nothing then i'm waiting on what a test of the 200 ema and after a test of the 200,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,ema i want to see a candle that closes above the high of the previous candle in this case we have all those rules met this would be another winning trade now i'm going to scroll out and speed this process up just by showing you the trades and not talking you through them no close below candle here even though we did have 100 bars below the 200 ema here we had an entry because we have a hundred bars above the 200 ema and we have a close above candle right here my green line is on one so if i scroll the chart out we move forward you can see that we had a few other instances and right about now we're on today's date can you tell me a problem with this strategy this is this is again a part of strategy development that most beginners don't think of and don't worry i'm not just leaving you with this i'm going to show you a strategy that happens a lot more and still has a decent winning rate right that kind of gave it away a decent winning rate the strategy,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,i'm going to show you next is actually one that wins around 70 of the time but has many more instances that it happens at this point i've completely given it away if you look at this chart we have one two three four five six seven we have seven trades since 2005. so although you might have a strategy that's going to win at a very high win rate let's say 80 and above the chances of you hitting a strategy or finding a strategy developing one learning one from someone else that has a winning percentage over 80 percent and produces enough trades throughout a large throughout time to be relevant at all is so small that that doesn't really exist because the more accuracy a trading strategy has most of the time the smaller amount of frequency that trading strategy happens so in this case the part of strategy development that was not considered although at first glance a 100 accurate trading strategy since 2005 sounds like something you should trade every time right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,but the variable that was not considered in this case is frequency frequency of a trading strategy is just as important as everything else if you have a strategy that wins 100 of the time it only has seven trades that's not as good as having a strategy that's only 60 accurate but instead of seven trades as 50.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,you see what i'm saying so that's something that was the main lesson of this video that i wanted to teach you was that you always want to pay attention to frequency and i also want to show you a few ways that you can counter this so with this strategy only having seven trades throughout 15 years what can you do well you can trade it on 20 currency pairs you could test this on 20 different currency pairs if it performs similar and you had a 90 win rate with a few more trades maybe it's worth it then you could try this on smaller time frames to see if it happens more often on smaller time frames those are some of the ways that you can counter the fact that this only has seven trades in 15 years but overall what you're going to find is this is just a strategy that does not happen enough for the excellent winning percentage to matter and that's something you don't want to run into in strategy development as i said let's call it seven trades we're gonna do some math now because we're about to look at the other strategy that has about a 70 accuracy but way more trades so let's do some math you win seven trades in 15 years let's say you risk a high amount and that's three percent three percent divided by our 15 years you're literally making 1.4 a year you're better off in the S&P500 which averages somewhere closer to eight percent per year so that makes absolutely no sense to do right now let's dive into a strategy on the aussie canada that's had many more trades and one at about a seventy percent accuracy let me teach you this strategy so first off let's talk about the strategy this is something i would actually suggest testing on smaller time frames i haven't personally done it yet,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,but i plan to start testing this on smaller time frames just to see what i come up with and just so you know i spend about an hour to two hours a day doing nothing but testing strategies that's the reason you see me come out with new strategies almost on a every other week basis here on youtube because i find something that works and i want to share it with you so in this case what is it that worked here on the aussie canada we're on the daily chart we're starting back at 2005 again but in this case our strategy is nothing more you don't like this is going to be so so freaking simple is nothing more than two wicks coming off of the 200 ema to the to the correct direction right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,so if i have a wick and a close above the ema the 200 emas all this black line is then i have a wick and another close above this 200 ema both of these wicks have touched the ema both of these closes are above the ema then i place a buy trade that looks something like this and i have my stop at around one atr plus 20 i think is what i did here which would look something like that and i had a max risk reward of 1.5 on these trades but let's check out the results and tell me would you rather trade this at 70 accurate or the other strategy we took a look at at 100 accurate let's take a look at a few of these so if we scroll through here i'm just going to show you a few other examples of this here we had a loss a losing trade that was exact based on the same exact thing we have two wicks coming off the 200 ema the body of the candle closes below it this only got to about a one to one,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,but i'm looking for a 1.5 out of these trades okay the next situation that we have look right here these bodies are touching the wicks are the only thing that can touch the 200 emo ama these bodies close below it so that's not an example of a trade i would take nothing else is until right here one week off the 200 ema two weeks off the 200 ema both candles closing below the 200 ema and the bodies of the candles not touching it there i have a short example as you can see pushing down this would have hit targets easily at a 1.5 to 1. so that's what every one of these trades is based on and let's count them up you're not going to have to count them with me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,i'll just count them edit this part out and you'll have to just trust me you can pause the video if you want to and check these trades but the results i came up with for this specific strategy were i'll give it to you in three two one 42 total trades 28 of those trades being wins 14 of those trades being losses 42 trades over 15 years i get it that's not a huge amount of trades either but it's much better than seven trades at 100 remember what that was that was 21 over 15 years if i'm not mistaken it was like 1.4 a year well what does this 42 trades give us we have 28 wins at a 1.5 to 1 risk reward in this case which gives us 42 42 minus our 14 losses gives us 28 remember the last strategy we talked about a three percent risk so let's do a three percent risk here too that's 84 in the last 15 years divided by 15.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,now you're getting closer and this is the beauty of this is that what if you had 10 pairs that you were doing this with okay 10 pairs at this rate 5.6 a year times 10 pairs turns into more like 56 a year now i don't know what you made last year or what you're look it's looking like you're gonna make this year but 56 is a really good return especially if you're only having to look at charts one time a day because these these trades are based on daily charts and you're trading a strategy this simple on 10 different currency pairs that would take you no time to look at charts and it could give you up to a 50 56 percent gain or at least it has in the past of course it's not a guarantee that this will happen in the future but this is all we have to go on in terms of what we're going to be trading and it gives a high likelihood that the market will react in a similar way over the next 15 years with how long of a span of time we have using this strategy so 56 percent let's look at what our 100 winning strategy would have done we had a 1.4 per year even if we had 10 pairs you're only looking at 14 a year so either way you slice it if you will you're much better off trading a strategy that has a lower win rate and a higher frequency rather than a higher win rate and a lower frequency now of course this was extremes and the only time this applies is in extremes when you have like seven trades on one strategy and 40 on another,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
N-l9a4BmU4Q,but that's something that you need to consider when you're testing developing strategies and when you're learning strategies from other people is consider the frequency of the strategy a hundred percent accurate doesn't mean  if it's only had seven trades in the last 15 years whereas you can have a strategy in our case just a second ago that would be 28 over 42 total trades only 67 accurate but made so much more money over a long period of time instead of making 14 a year that strategy over the past 15 years has made 56 a year assuming of course that you have 10 pairs that perform in a similar way hopefully none of that went over your head this is something i think about every single day so if that got confusing i am really sorry i hope it didn't though and if it did go back and re-watch it a couple of times i'm sure it will start to make sense but with that said i hope this video taught you the lesson that i was trying to get across which is always pay attention to that third factor of a strategy we always have two factors that almost everyone thinks of win rate and risk reward but don't leave out the redheaded stepchild don't leave out frequency frequency is just as important as the other two and you want to make sure you're trading a strategy that trades that happens frequent enough for it to matter and for you to make money on so that being the case if you enjoyed the video click that like button if you're interested in some more free training we have a full strategy listed below full strategy free training in the description we also just opened up a brand new case study group into our advanced mentoring program called the eap if you're interested in that it's the top link in the description in that program there's a full training course going over the strategies i use on a day-to-day basis you'll also be receiving three to five emails per week of trades that i'm taking based on the strategies you learned in that course we have risk management training discipline training and obviously it's a mentor program so any questions you have it will be me you're talking to directly and me responding to those questions for you to help you along your trading path to accomplishing your trading goals so that sounds like something you're interested in top link in the description labeled eap if not that's totally fine too just make sure that you are subscribed that you've clicked that notification bell so that you're alerted about this interesting content we come out with each and every week hope you guys trade green,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

v3bk2MdJ9lw,so over the past several years of my trading career I've tried a number of different ways to help accurately predict what the markets going to do I've used just as I'm sure you have indicators oscillators but there's one way that by far has outperformed the rest and it has nothing to do with an indicator it's actually based solely around price action and what I'd like to do is share that accurate technique with you today in this video this is a technique that we use week after week here at the trading channel to help us predict market moves and it helped us predict this move you see here on the dollar Swiss where we came down into this previous level and have since made over a 100 pip rally so if that sounds like something is going to be valuable for your trading one make sure to stick around for this entire video to make sure you click that subscribe button to be alerted whenever we come out with other free educational content like this and last but not least make sure you go ahead and click that like button to help support the channel while the intro and disclaimer roll and I'll be right back to share this extremely valuable content with you see you guys on the other side [Music] hey guys so welcome back in this video we're going through a few different things and let's go ahead and talk about that first really really quickly the first thing we're going to look at is proof of concept so I've told you guys that this is a really accurate way to predict price action but in order for you to really trust that statement or try it for yourself you need some type of proof so what we're gonna do is take a look at some predictions we've had from last week that ended up working out really well using this technique directly after that I'm gonna teach you this exact technique that we're using in order to make accurate price action predictions and last but not least we'll be taking a look at the top 5 major pairs and making our predictions for this week on those pairs to give you guys some value going forward so let's go ahead and get started with the video here we have the USD Swiss on this pair as we talked about during the intro this markets at over a 100 pip rally from a level in the market that we accurately predicted would act as support and how did we do that well that's exactly what we're gonna talk about as soon as we get back from this quick clip showing you guys exactly what we were predicting out of this pair last week so let's take a look at that clip and I'll be right back,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,but we will be continuing to look for possible long trades here on the dollar Swiss around this level because what we're expecting is at least a retest of this resistance level and possibly even trained continuation all the way up to 0.96 8 for out of this pair and if this market gets up to 0.96 84 that's 11 we can look for possible shorting opportunities with it alright guys so back here on the dollar Swiss as you can see this market pulled down into that area exactly where we were looking at last week around 0.9 5 6 3 we're getting a nice push a nice rally out of this market and got right up into what level the level we pointed out as possible resistance right here a red dotted line expecting that level to help us with some counter trend moves so as I said proof of concept as you can see this worked really well last week here on the dollar Swiss,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,and if you go back a few videos we produce weekly market prediction videos each and every week and there are many many times that these predictions end up being very very accurate again you can go back through the previous weeks of videos in the weekly market prediction series and see this working really well the old time and this is not me telling you to go out and blindly start placing trades based around this knowledge that's not going to make you a profitable trader what I hope to accomplish with these videos is showing you guys how simple it can be to predict price action and give you a technique that you can apply to your own trading plan everything that you see here must be tested and you have must make sure you're comfortable with the risks involved not only in trading but in the specific strategies and techniques that you choose to use so now that we've discussed that let's talk about how we were actually able to make this prediction and how we make predictions each and every week well the first thing we have to talk about is the timeframe if you look right up here you will see that we are on the daily timeframe here on the dollar Swiss this timeframe works really well the weekly timeframe using the technique we're going to talk about in this video works really well also,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,but for me I find that I find a lot more trading opportunities using it here on the daily timeframe so high timeframes work better than low timeframes now that we've established that what else are we looking for on this higher time frame in order to predict these price action moves well it's actually a very simple concept that we've discussed here on the channel before but repetition is key when you're trying to learn anything so that's why we're discussing it again as you can see we had a market here on the dollar Swiss that was pushing up to a resistance level then what happened this was our first clue once we broke above this resistance level after breaking a previous resistance level that resistance level that was broken is a high likelihood place for the market to pull back to and rally out of in an uptrend or,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,if in a downtrend that very most recent structure support level that was broken it's going to be a very accurate place to predict that the market is going to continue in trend to the downside so that very simple concept applied out here on the daily chart is what is made for some really accurate predictions for us here at the trading channel week after week now whenever you add this most previous level of structure that we just broke which would be right here our resistance level whenever you add that concept to a structured level that has been tested multiple times as you can see this level was used as resistance twice here and as support by our big green candle right here when you combine those two factors that's what has come together to create one of the most accurate ways I've ever found to predict price action moves and when using these two concepts together you're not only predicting price action moves you're also predicting them in in trend continuation as you can see this market was breaking structure levels into new highs and the only way for this concept to work is if the markets breaking structure levels in the new highs or breaking structure levels in the new lows and a downtrend in order for you to wait for that pullback in to that previous level that maybe combines with another previous level of support looking left and give you a possible accurate trading opportunity based around your trading plan so take this concept go out in the market test it for yourself see how many times it works vs. doesn't work apply different things to this you can apply indicators to this to help make it more accurate there's nothing wrong with that and you can apply anything else that already exists in your trading plan to this as well and guys I know this concept sounds simple and for a lot of new traders for some reason they believe that trading has to be extremely complicated but in reality the more simple your rules are for trading the easier it will be for you to follow them and more complicated doesn't always mean more accurate this is extremely simple and I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of the best ways I've found to accurately predict market moves this extremely simple concept of understanding trend and structure levels and guys if you'd like more advanced training on structure levels trend along with the entry reasons and the entire trading plan that we use here at the trading channel then you can learn more about that in the EAP training program which there's a link for in the description but otherwise let's continue the video so now that we've talked about what we're using let's go ahead and apply this to some other markets here we have the dollar,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,Swiss right we've already talked about last week's prediction on this pair there was a move up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,and we also talked last week about a prediction of this market coming in to zero point nine six seven and possibly finding resistance it's exactly what we're still expecting expecting a counter trend moved from this level is 0.96 non seven to push the market down somewhere near where our most previously broken level of resistance because we know that's a high likelihood place for this market to get to and then turn around in trend continuation so that's what we're predicting next year for the dollar Swiss it's going to move on to another pair now next up we'll be looking at the euro dollar so since the beginning of the year the euro dollar has been doing the same thing it's just been consolidating and what we've been capturing here at the trading channel is moves off of resistance and support just last week we had a prediction that this market which find support from the one point two to three nine level and that's exactly what happened here on this pair now what are we looking for going forward we've created a new sort of resistance level right in here around the one point two four five,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,Oh the market gets up to that level I'll be looking for that as possible resistance for a counter trading opportunity if we get above that around one point two five even will be the next level to look for a possible trade here on this pair for us here at the trading channel now this market pushes down we'll be looking yet again at this support level to either provide us with support and give us a possible trading opportunity or to break so that we can start looking for trained continuation trades on the way down and that's our predictions here for the euro dollar next up we'll take a look at the dollar yen so here on the dollar yen we had another accurate prediction from last week this accurate prediction came from a previous structure level and if you'll take a look what was this previous structure level well last week this was the most previous level of resistance that was broken it also combined with other levels of structure that we saw looking left in the past once the market pulled back down into that level and since then we've had a nice rally up of a little over 100 pips we expected this market to get somewhere around this previous level of resistance and I'm actually a play a clip showing you guys this from last week's video and I'll be right back after that clip to give you guys the predictions we have going forward here on the dollar yen it's next week,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,so we have another major level of structure that is formed the reason is because we have one to three times the market has used this level as support and resistance now this market broke into new highs hold back directly to that level we're currently just hovering around this level at one of six point eight two but we will be looking on lower timeframes for possible entry reasons for that trading plan to come together on this dollar yen pair and give us a push up because we are expecting this push up to come in to the 108 area right here at this previous major resistance combining that with these previous major support levels so that's alright traders so this market was hovering somewhere around the 106.8 level last week and as you can see we had a pretty nice rally out of this market we ended up pushing up directly into this previous level of structural resistance that we were talking about becoming possible support so another instance where predicting market moves in this very simple way has paid off pretty well and let's go ahead and talk about what we're expecting in the future here out of this pair well since we have created this double top situation here on the dollar yen we're not really looking for a trade at the moment what we'll wait on is to see if this market get back down into the 106.8 level once more give us a possible long trade or if we see this market ahead higher we're looking at the same level as a possible counter trend move to the downside here on this pair and those are the two predictions we're looking at here on the dollar yen we'll go ahead move on to our next pair now which will be the pound dollar on the pound dollar last week we had a prediction that this market would come into our level around one point four to five between that and this wig right up here that you can see looking left and give us some type of entry reason to push the market lower we got into that zone that's what we've had so far here out of the pound dollar but what are we expecting next out of this pair well since this market has just come up high into this resistance looking left,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,and we've broken above the most previous level of resistance we're actually waiting to see if we can get some kind of loan opportunity for trend continuation up into 1.4 409 a really good place to look for that opportunities if this market pulls back into one point 409 - that's a level that's acted as support and resistance multiple times in the past as you can see little spouts of support and resistance in through here so again a great place to look for trinken you asian for us here at the trading channel is going to be around 1.4 o 9 - out of this power dollar pair and the final pay we're gonna take a look at and predict the market moves for you using this very simple but accurate technique is the Aussie dollar here on the Aussie dollar we predicted a possible shorting situation coming out of this zone right in here the markets still hovering around in this zone so our expectations are still the same we're looking for possible reasons to go short out of this pair from the zero point seven 805 level now if the market starts to push down from this level a good place to look for some possible long opportunities is zero point seven seven one five and if we get a break above this level will look for possible shorting situation around zero point seven eight eight one and that traders is our predictions on the top five major pairs along with a really valuable tool that you can hopefully add into your trading if you're interested in doing so and for those of you who are still struggling to become profitable I personally know how that feels I spent a lot of time studying strategies and techniques that ended up not working at all in the markets,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
v3bk2MdJ9lw,and I know how frustrating it can be to consistently lose money in these markets but thankfully I was able to find techniques and strategies that worked for me when it comes to being more accurate and ultimately being more profitable as a trader and at this point my trading career I really enjoy sharing that knowledge and information with newer traders that are struggling again because I know exactly how that feels so if you're interested in taking the next step in your trading journey if you're interested in investing in your trading education if you want to actually start taking this trading thing very very seriously then I've left a link in the description for the EAP training program feel free to check that out for some more advanced trading you can see on your screen now what I was included in that program and if you stay past the outro you'll see testimonials and traders who have already been through that program,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

ifAOlaKmuO8, what's up everyone alright so as you guys know I set up an e trade account because I wanted to find out whether or not the free Commission's are actually worth it I wanted to know the true cost of free Commission's well today I know I got totally buy E Trade and I am down three thousand seven hundred and thirteen dollars on the day and it is because this platform is simply not fast enough so what I want to do is I want to break down the trades I took I want to show you how I have it set up for for my layout for trading and I'm going to show you an example of a better execution in thinkorswim and a better execution in the Lightspeed platform and then you can make the decision of which platform you want to use for your trading but you know what each trade doesn't work for my strategy and I'm about to show you why [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,all right so what happened on each raid today were to market orders and each one of them the first market order took 20 seconds to execute 20 seconds and the second order took 31 seconds to execute 31 seconds now just for reference guys you have got I've got my screen share running here so you can see my actual screen I'm gonna put up let's see I'll just put up my Ameritrade account here just for the heck of it this Ameritrade account as you can see is up 674 dollars today which is pretty good and if I do an order here for one share as a market order you're gonna see that that fills almost instantaneously it is very quick just like that I'm in and just like that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,I'm back out now Ameritrade is not quite as fast as let's say like this right here is the Sterling software that is used with Lightspeed and with the CME Group which is a broker that allows you a day trade with Lil's 500 bucks here I press shift 1 and look at the number just going up that's how fast the executions are with real money now this is a simulator but that's still how fast they are it is absolutely incredible now in etrade it ended up taking 20 seconds for my first market order to fill which is I mean,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,"it's mind-boggling how slow it is and part of the reason for the loss is my own fall because I thought that the platform just hadn't received my order because it was taking so long so I pressed the Buy button two more times so the end result was that when the orders finally went through I had a much bigger position than I was expecting and that ended up being a bigger loss since the trade did not go in my favor which is fine I mean that's that's part of the deal but the issue of the 22nd and 32nd order execution is horrible so let's look at this the actual fills here my entry on this was let's see down here this was where I jumped in with 3000 shares this is where I sent my first market order to buy Bo XL 3,000 shares at 1017 and 41 seconds all right so what I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna pull up this trade I've got it right here so it was 40 there we go so it was about 47 minutes into this video now this video",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,you're gonna see looks kind of crazy and that is because I was trading in three brokerage accounts at the same time I like to challenge myself and take things to the next level so I had a trade Ameritrade and my Lightspeed platform all open at the same time so let's look at this trade on bo XL alright so I'm about to press the Buy button here and actually hold up let's just rewind real quick okay so there we go so we know that I press the Buy button on the etrade account at what time was it it was 10 17 and 41 seconds all right so that's when I press the first Buy button and I press it a second time at 1744 all right so I'll just move this down here for a second all right so first I buy the shares in my mare trade account so I go first with a merit trade not with any particular reason for that order I just clicked by here first,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,"so I'm gonna click the Buy button and watch how fast it executes by instant I'm in with 3000 shares current price 262 2.62 cents I got filled between the spread suite that's awesome that's a great execution quick order quick fill time good price check check check TD Ameritrade for the win and that's on the thinkorswim platform so now I'm in with 3,000 shares at 62 I have Bo XL right here I have my cursor on the Buy button right here and I'm gonna press the Buy button in 3 seconds you're gonna see me click it there we go I just clicked it once and I just clicked it a second time so I'm trying to take 6000 shares so I'm about to take the trade and TD Ameritrade all right so right here at TD Ameritrade I'm about to press the Buy button I'm not in any particular order but right watch it you'll see the click of the button my mouse is right here so there we go I just bought it",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,so I press the Buy button and that was at seventeen ten seventeen and forty seconds one second execution I am now filled with three thousand shares at 1017 and 41 seconds with an average price of 262 nine which is an order filled between the spread which is a great execution that is really solid okay so now I've already brought my mouse up here to e train and I'm about to click the Buy button I just click the Buy button and I just clicked it a second time and now I just pressed shift one and shift one because I'm trying to figure out what happened all right so let's rewind let's look at what that means so I press the Buy button twice once at forty one and a second time at forty four so as soon as my order was filled at Ameritrade I assumed my mouse up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,and I press the Buy button once I waited three seconds and nothing happened so I thought maybe my order was declined or I wasn't sure what was happening so I pressed the Buy button a second time now if I had had this window fully open I would have seen that my orders were in the open status and that they were pending right here but I didn't see that because I had the the window minimized and I know John mentioned to me he's a member of the hundred K Club he's a trader in our chair who's made over half a million dollars trading the same strategy as me using thinkorswim and he said Ross you you really if you're good try to do this you should really have the windows maximize having them minimized you're not seeing some important stuff that you need to see like your order status and I thought yeah that's probably true but I think it'll be okay well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,so what happened was I press the Buy button and this order status was actually pending it was waiting and the second 3000 share order was also waiting and then what I did was I clicked on the montage window here and I just pressed one now shift one is a speed key so if I press shift one I just bought one share and that's because I went down here into my speed key setup and I changed shift one from a thousand shares to one share specifically so I could show you guys how they work alright so I have the speed keys setup there and then under the settings I have speed keys checked so I pressed shift 1 because I was like okay I want to you know maybe my orders weren't going through because I don't have enough buying power so instead of three thousand shares,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,"I'll try to just buy a thousand shares so I press shift 1 and shift 1 and that's how as you can see right here I filled 1000 and 1000 shares so in the video my to 1000 share orders actually filled faster than my to 3,000 share market orders these two orders both filled at 69 ok so now I'm still holding with a merit rate and I mean with each trade and I'm like ok I guess I'm just taking 2,000 shares probably because I didn't have enough buying power or something and now I'm going into my main account to take the position to my main account I go to my main account and I click shift one shift one instantaneous one second order ok I'm in right now with three thousand shares 281 that's actually kind of a bad fill but you can see how it did pop up there for a second so I press shift 1 and I kind of you know whatever I got a little bit of a bad fill but that happens ok now I just switched over my positions are gone because I switched to my retirement account okay",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,so I'm this is trading on steroids I'm trading in four accounts at the same time alright so now I'm in my retirement account if you Excel I press shift 1 and I got a partial fill in my order but that's not because it's a market order it's because it's a lemon order and I put my price at 282 and so the price is 282 by 290 so my order is filling kind of slowly because the stock is moving up quickly and then I press the 2nd order to buy at 291 that order filled Lu LD is circuit breaker fault and I'm thinking this is gonna be a home run trade I'm starting to feel really good check out my Ameritrade account down here I'm holding three thousand shares of sixty-two I'm up over a thousand dollars so now I end up bringing my mouse down and taking profit on a merit raid I'm gonna do that in one second,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,"and that's just to lock up gains as I go and at this point I don't even know that I've realized that I'm holding 8,000 shares so I'm like okay time to take some profit I'm just gonna sell market order I put my hand on the mouse and then I haven't clicked it yet I'm kind of deciding what I'm gonna do I'm going back and forth I'm like well if it's gonna break over three maybe I'll hold it let me give it another second so I'm really looking between this account in this account Ameritrade and each trade Ameritrade and even N and Lightspeed I go ahead and sell right there and my order executes not the fastest execution ever right there but it was still pretty much a one-second click buy at 50 and the order is gone by 52 so that was a two-second long execution not bad not great not bad all right so I just locked up six hundred and seventy four dollars and now I'm looking at this and I put my mouse here",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,"and this is my way of saying with my mouse what the why am i holding 8,000 shares how did this happen and so I'm confused and I look at my cost basis and I'm in at 281 which is high and I'm like alright now I'm in it because I was up five hundred fifty-two dollars this morning on a couple of decent traits but now all of a sudden onion with a much bigger position than I was expecting and now I'm gonna have to see this thing through which is not what I wanted so now I'm in the position and I've got no choice but to see it through now if I was in a small position I probably just would have put in my order put my order maybe up in the 90s to try to get back out but now I'm in pretty heavy",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,and so I started to get a little frenzied a little emotional something unexpected happened and that ended up being kind of the beginning of this going into a really bad trade where because I was in with a bigger position guess what the emotional stakes are now higher and this account is only like twenty five thousand dollars of equity twenty five thousand five hundred so the five hundred dollars a profit was great but now I'm like I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get out of this eight thousand share position without taking a good-sized loss so I sit with it and wait that ends up being a mistake and I'm gonna fast forward here let's see to 107 so by 107 I'm trying to now get out of this position I know that I'm I'm gonna get a huge loss and it's really disappointing the stock is now dropped down to 230 it did not break three and so now I'm trying to sell I took the loss in my main account you know again this is part of the deal with trading sometimes this happens,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ifAOlaKmuO8,but it certainly doesn't help to have this type of issue so let's go back here so I'm trying to sell and what I'm about to do is I'm gonna click on the sell button so let me just fast forward one second so I'm all out of my main account there oops I press the sell button and nothing happens notice how I press the sell button at approximately 10:30 7 and 17 seconds so I'm like again what the heck I press it again and it says please check the number of shares so I press the cancel all button and then I press sell again and it still isn't working so now I'm like okay I need to I need to open up this window and see what's going on and even though I press cancel all it didn't cancel this pending sell order that is sitting from 3724 so at 37 24 I have this pending order now the current time was just well the current time just before I went into the full screen was 37 28 so 30 at 37 30,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

ifAOlaKmuO8,"so five seconds so subtract five seconds from that and we're at 37 54 is when the order finally executed and I pressed it at 37 24 that took 30 seconds to execute that's unacceptable I can't trade like that now for some of you guys your strategy may accommodate a 30 second lag in your market order I will also say that trading with 3,000 shares and having 20 second lag you might say well it's because I took an 8,000 share position but it took 20 seconds of lag to buy 3000 shares I do recognize that placing orders for just one share seemed to execute quite quickly bo Excel oops let's take this back in here so bo Excel one share shift one those seem to execute pretty fast but no one trades with one share and also my hotkey here kind of screws up there so I'm getting in and out here with my five shares pretty easily but of course every time don't use the exclamation point for your hotkey because it's gonna screw you up",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

d32cvhffgco,we'd all be millionaires I don't have that crystal ball all I can do is look at the data look at the data put it together see where I think the recession is going to be and I still think it could start in Q2 I'm not sure uh Q3 at the latest and so if I believe that what should I do with my money how can I make cash off of that and usually what you see is when equities get beat up bonds end up doing well last year we had a very rare air instance and that was when both equities and bonds both got hammered down it's only happened like that twice in history before last year now it's three times and so it's in my opinion it's not going to happen again in 2023 and so if I believe equities are going to get hammered down,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,and I believe that the FED is close to going ahead and hitting that level of terminal rate for the Fed rate and they're going to get to the top where they're not going to raise rates anymore where I think we can all agree that it's going to be around 5.25 and I know you'll hear Jamie dimon the CEO of of JP Morgan oh I could get all the way up to six percent they would love to have it get up to six percent the banks and financials make even more money it's not I think it's going to be around 5.25 max if it even gets there it could the fed's talking pretty tough game and so far everything they said they have done and so I believe that they are worried about what people think about them they want to get their power back their respect back and so so they're going to go all out to crush to crush inflation even at the cost of the US economy thus the recession,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

d32cvhffgco,so I see a Max of 75 basis points going up you know there's no crystal ball it can change any given day you could see it a little bit more a little bit less and so if we put it at the top part the top part of that range at 5.25 and that means we could see a little bit more of a change in in bond rates because bonds usually go the inverse of the Fed so if the FED continues to raise rates then I'm to expect what I'm expecting that the bonds should continue to have downward pressure until they pause once they get to the top the terminal rate they're not going to raise rates anymore and that tells us what well the long term over the next year or two if not more should be very very good for bonds and I'm talking very good since bonds had one of their worst years in the history of bonds and so if that's the case why why would I not jump all over this because if the equity markets are getting absolutely ham money's flowing out during a recession to go to safety you know what safety is bonds and so I believe that the FED starting to pause and then drop rates to save the economy will absolutely stimulate bonds higher and so if I believe a recession is coming that is what I must do with my investment I'm not here to tell you what to do with yours,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,I'm not here to give any Financial advice I'm just sharing with you my thought process what I'm doing how I'm preparing for the said recession if you'd like to see every single thing I'm doing buying and selling over there at the patreon the link is down below file the new 2023 recession portfolio file the high risk one for those looking for additional risk you can see what I'm doing see if it makes sense do your due diligence and I you can come over and see what stocks are absolutely killing it that link is in the description or you can join here on YouTube I have the channel membership down below pinned in the comments or in the descriptions if I got time to put the comment I did and you can join us at Tesla member higher you get the same portfolios private Discord members only videos as well at both places come on over and join,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,and I believe that this is going to be the right move if the stock market collapses say it goes all the way down to 3 300 and I'm in bonds for the majority usually it's 40 bonds 60 equities I'm going to probably make it even more bonds than in equities right now until we get through a recession because I believe a recession is coming sometime in the next 12 months I believe it'll be here and we'll be through it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,but the thing is I actually believe that normally you know you get 60 to 70 percent through a recession you see that stock markets turn they turn and actually go up before we're officially out of the recession this one might not take that long before we're out it might take 40 to 50 percent of the way through a recession before we start rolling because a lot of it's priced in already you've seen these markets you hear everybody talking about it most of the analysts expect the recession all the warning signs are black layering red and so it's been priced in it's been priced in and so I believe moving forward that we will have the opportunity to take advantage of this with the bonds I think the bonds is where it is at so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,you know I always say stock mode it might be Bond mall right now because I'm telling you I like them that much that I'm going to be moving a substantial amount of my money around in my portfolio and for those following along here on YouTube don't worry we'll be coming on here talking about some of the moves I always share a lot of that it just takes time to make videos about it and get there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,but if you want to see it all happen right away and everything else like I said that's for the patreon and you're supporting me and I appreciate that so come on over and do that uh it's something I want to show you some things here we'll get right into why I think the recession's coming and the first things first this is the manufacturing United States manufacturing PMI this is over the last 10 years folks anything below 50 is really bad that means it's contraction the United States is now below 50 and it's dropping quickly last time we seen something like this was 2020 when everybody stopped working everything was closed and now look at this you don't have the lockdowns you don't have the shutdowns you don't have covet like we did back then and yet we're dropping like a rock this should be making everyone nervous this is manufacturing in the U.S absolutely collapsing and no one's talking about it this is something you need to pay attention to you want a learning flag you want a big red warning flag this is the one and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,when orders in manufacturing drop what happens next well manufacturers don't need as many workers they start laying people off they might start with management and work their way down to the workers and that is is what I'm going to tell you is going to happen and when you see that number continuing to stay under 50 it means every month is another contraction less and less and so I believe that that is a major sign the last 10 years it's only been down below 50 twice once in 2020 and now and you don't believe there's going to be a recession I'm telling you this there's gonna and that was a major thing now you can go out and you can look at some of the other big analysts look at this BlackRock says Uh there's going to be a reckoning for investors who haven't realized that fed's got a whole new playbook the fed's not stopping they know what's going on they know the FED is trying to get everything back they're going to hold interest rates above five percent for the whole of 2023.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,that's going to crush the economy and the the right now if you look at the Fed rate thing the Fed rate follower they believe there's going to be probably I think around two rate Cuts before the end of this year BlackRock says look there may not be one and if there's not one and they got two of them priced in what happens to the stock market they do they do not make those cuts what's going to happen the stock market well they priced in two cuts if there's not two cuts that Mark is going to get hit bad and so I'm watching that as well you start putting all this the the inversion of the two and ten year it's one of the worst it's been in 40 years the three month in the 30 year the 20 year the 10-year there's all kinds of issues out there right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,and uh if you're following them you know how bad it is uh here's another one of course and BlackRock says uh the world's largest asset manager says central banks are deliberately causing recessions I believe it I absolutely believe it because they have to they're not going to come out and say they are they got to to get inflation under control they messed up too much money was put in there too much liquidity they got to bring it back to the point it's going to be easier for them to get us out of a recession a couple stimulus checks extended unemployment benefits and then boom they got everything back under control a little bit of deflation even and that's why BlackRock knows uh what they're talking about here are some of the scary things St Louis fed non-voting member uh Buller doe for those he is not in a camp wanting to slow pace of great hikes he wants to keep him up he even said maybe get it up to five point whatever as soon as they can do it quick 50 basis point hikes whatever we have to do front load it now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,and then we can pause and watch it and adjust it as we go forward he's actually not wrong that's not a bad idea actually at this point I believe that may have been the best the best course of action probably not what they're going to do 25 basis points over the next two meetings maybe three meetings that's the most three meetings the most I think maybe two though uh then of course you got this you can see what's going on down here three forehead wins what are the four just to make it quick China's reopening and of course the police in the U.S savings which we talked about we talked about both inflation could be sticky at four it gets the four and it doesn't go much lower like it's supposed to that's bad news Market's gonna get hit the FED is still repairing its broken reputation won't cut rates I've said that too you that the FED is going to do everything it can to restore that that validation that they know what they're doing and they it could cause some pain,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,and they came out and said this we're going to make some unpopular decisions over this the course of dealing with this and they know what that means that means the government's going to get mad at them working people are going to get mad because they need unemployment to go higher they need the housing prices to come down and they're going to do some things that make it tough on politicians because a politicians looks everything Rosy and unicorns and rainbows and it's not going to happen because this is these are numbers and they need to fix them and that's what they're going to do and it's not going to make everybody happy and so we'll see how it goes so I'm going to be moving a substantial I'm thinking 50 of my investments into bonds at this time if this is interesting to you and you would like to see what I'm doing come over and join at the patreon or here on the channel because I'm going to be bringing it to you and it's going to happen quick I'm still dollar cost averaging but I'm going to up that dramatically,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
d32cvhffgco,and so that's my next course of action and I do believe it's the right one I want to make as much as I can and I want to preserve as much as I can through any downturn so we'll see how this works out that's my update if you haven't done it get those free stocks from Weeble remember they sell crypto over there and fractional shares you want a little bit of a Berkshire Hathaway dot a shares you can do that over there for a dollar you can buy some Berkshire Hathaway and so take advantage of that link down below put 100 in get up to 12 free stocks worth up to 30 600 and you got the MooMoo link as well put a hundred dollars in click the link you can get five free stocks worth up to ten thousand dollars I appreciate you stopping by let's get out there and make some money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gBPn4wEKKrw,so i was pretty impressed by that because they're taking the revenue from that and they're donating some of that into planting trees uh donating money to other sustainable programs to help make this world a little bit better and that is you know if you're if you've been watching my channel i'm big on the ev industry i'm big on making this world a better place and we know that ev industry is growing there are a lot of big places out there you know look at china they want 20 of all their cars to be ev by 2025. a lot of the big companies out there are moving to sustainable programs they want to get that carbon neutral footprint and this company is leading the way in that industry as well and i was pretty impressed with that the next thing i would like to talk about is fedora this is a company they just purchased they're introducing it in canada it is a restaurant food service company and their goal obviously have carbon neutral footprint,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gBPn4wEKKrw,and i like where it's going a lot of people are using these kinds of services as we move past that we get into their face drive health what i like about face drive right now is they're doing their part and what they're doing is working with an app-oriented contact tracing called tray scan they're leveraging bluetooth technology users are alerted with a notification when they come near a person who has previously tested positive the laborers international union in north america announced it would adopt face drives trace scan technology for all 130 000 members and their families in canada when i hear things like this you know they're out there the sustainability programs it just gives you a good feeling when you're talking about this this company the next thing i really liked about face drive is is how they're working with bel air athletics us here who grew up in my age bracket we all know who is a part of bel air the fresh prince of course will smith they have teamed up with him and they are doing a sustainable co-branded clothing line with bel air athletics and i'm very impressed by that and now as we move into that last leg it is steer a lot of us have heard of steer it's very impressive it's a membership based initiative that gives users access to a fleet of tech forward and low admissions vehicles it's a subscription base you get a car if you don't you can get another one you can switch around this is some pretty awesome stuff they have right here i've heard nothing but good things about it and i would highly recommend looking into this i have the website here for you to go ahead and come on your own time but now after this i showed you five pieces of their company that i am very impressed with face drive hasn't gone on but they're not the only ones out there if you take a look at like blackrock they're moving towards investing into these companies that care about the environment they are moving into an investment strategy to be more focused on these kind of companies and even even with amazon amazon out there just they said that they're putting 10 billion that's with a b into climate change fund to counteract the effects of climate change and global warming they're not the only ones of course i know microsoft also is moving in that direction they are pushing to become carbon neutral in the next 10 years these are the kind of things that companies should be doing face drive is leading the way with that and i'm very impressed with them so at this point i am happy to say i like this company i think you all should take take notice of it take a look down in the description i have a few links to some articles that i would like you to go ahead and take a look at you can learn a little bit more about this company you're going to be impressed with what you find because i know i was so thanks for stopping by and like i always say let's get out there and make some money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

JW9J93hrDNE, there's a shortcut to getting rich and in this video i'm going to show you what it is let's say you need to get to the other side of the world and you're given the option of taking a plane boat a car or walking you're picking the plane right but what if i told you that 98 of people today are choosing to walk say the other side of the world represents financial freedom and your transportation choice is how you make money the vast majority of people are choosing the slow lane to wealth while a small minority choose to join the fast lane and i think that's where you want to be too everyone is being honest they would admit that the risk of the slow lane is equally as risky you're putting your entire fiscal future in the hands of some elements you can't control your boss your company the stock market these are things you can't control as opposed to having a business there's some elements there you can control,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JW9J93hrDNE,and i hold that holding a job for 50 years and investing all your money into the stock market is riskier a book called the millionaire fastlane really opened my eyes to the subject of financial roadmaps and how we can choose which path to take the slow lane is basically just going to college getting a decent job investing 10 of your paycheck into the stock market and retiring a millionaire at age 65. it's not bad but it's like walking to get to your destination you'll get there eventually but it's going to take you a long time and you won't be able to be rich and young at the same time on the other hand you have the fast lane,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JW9J93hrDNE,so this is the plane that sort of takes you directly to your destination in the fastest way possible anyone can get on that plane but it does take a lot of effort and if you want fast wealth creation and an extraordinary lifestyle this is the roadmap you want to be on so speaking of ways to grow wealth i want to introduce you guys to the sponsor of this video tradestation who won broker of the year 2021 in trading views broker awards even though this video is not about investing i think it's super important to know that almost all of the wealthy investor money whether it be real estate stocks or especially right now crypto tradestation is a high quality and hassle-free platform that allows you to buy sell and trade many types of securities and several cryptocurrencies and what i love is that they offer zero commission pricing for stocks options and futures they offer a large variety of tools and resources that are honestly super helpful when you are trying to invest in stocks etfs options futures bonds and even iras on their platform and if you do ever run into any problems they have live chats and 24 7 customer support for futures and crypto related issues right now tradestation is offering 10 worth of free crypto when you sign up so if you want to take advantage of this exclusive promo go open your account today with the link below and now back to the video six years ago i made the decision to find that plane ride after not getting to medical school i decided that i'd become an entrepreneur and say no to the conventional life trust me this was super scary because i'd spent the previous 23 years believing the only way to get rich was to become a doctor or a lawyer but luckily i took a leap of faith and within five years i had my first one million dollar year i'm not saying that to brag because if you got to see some of the struggles and major failures i've had on that path it wouldn't seem all that impressive but i want to be transparent with you guys and i actually share my detailed monthly income reports on my instagram page and the reason for that is because i know that it's going to make more people go out and find their plane too by sharing my struggles my wins and my story i know people will relate because there has got to be millions of people in the same exact shoes i was in walking but knowing they want to run or in our case fly so is that it is that the shortcut to becoming insanely rich the answer is sorta and the following section is even more important because you need to understand it otherwise you'll stop halfway while trying to find your plane and the hard truth is that while the plan exists for all of us finding it is actually extremely extremely hard i'll stop speaking figuratively and just say flat out making your first 100 000 is extremely difficult likely much harder than working a normal 9 to 5 job and that is why so many people end up quitting the pursuit the thing with entrepreneurship is that it revolves heavily around a compound growth curve this is what the typical income graph looks like for someone with a good job we have single digit raises most years but overall it's pretty flat over the first few years you'll likely make more money than your peers trying to start their own businesses now let's layer on the income of a pretty typical entrepreneur obviously some major differences at first glance right most entrepreneurs will make very little at the start because the first 100 000 is so incredibly hard you're learning you're trying new things failing doing a lot of work but not getting paid and as a result you'll probably make less money that's exactly what happened to me i did not make good money coming out of college because i did not have a nine-to-five job instead i pursued side hustles and started businesses and i actually lost money on a lot of my ventures but like all challenging things at some point you'll get through that initial trek through mud and cow turds and stumble across a scene much nicer which is basically unlimited income potential on your schedule stick through those initial years and you'll hit that inflection point where your income surpasses that of your friends continues rising and then eventually reaches the moon here's a clip from elon musk on what it was like in his first years as an entrepreneur sleeping in an office and showering at the ymca when my brother and i were starting our first company instead of getting an apartment we just rented us a small office and we slept on the couch and we we showered at the the ymca and uh we're so hot up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JW9J93hrDNE,we had just one computer so the the website was up during the day and i was coding at night seven days a week all the time that's really what makes entrepreneurship so dangerous right the lack of results at the beginning and immense challenges makes people quit a typical business takes three years to become profitable and being self-employed has similar challenges you guys have probably seen this cartoon or this one and yeah this happens a lot and i see it all the time even with myself i've quit businesses prematurely and i have had lots of failed opportunities just because i did not stay consistent for long enough for example take a look at john krasinski his story is absolutely crazy and shows exactly why it pays to stay on the path and as soon as the car left the driveway of the school i said i'm moving to new york and i'm going to be an actor and my mom paused for probably a half a second and she said great go do it cut to two and a half years later i was like um so i'm out this is terrible,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JW9J93hrDNE,it's so scary this is the worst waiting table's not as fun as they say and she said you know it's september just wait it out just wait till the end of the year don't give up just yet i was ready to i was telling her to come get me and in new york yeah and three weeks later i got the office i think sometimes we need to be reminded of the stories of people who didn't quit and end up making it because at least for me it's super inspirational and shows that it can be done i really encourage you to watch more interviews of successful entrepreneurs learn from their journey and also get inspired by the struggles that they actually went through read the millionaire fast lane too if you haven't as that will really drive this road map into your head perhaps even more than this video here's a clip of another entrepreneur grant cardone i know a lot of people either love him or hate him,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JW9J93hrDNE,but you really can't deny his work ethic and how far he's gotten that's not the first step to success though first step is you have to give something up you have to give up something about who you are you want to solve a problem you got to give up the idea that you you've either tried every way possible or you don't know the you know that you've already tried that or that's not going to work or it's not you got to give something up so there is a shortcut to wealth but shortcuts aren't easy otherwise everyone would be rich to get rich and be able to enjoy your wealth you'll need to make an incredible number of sacrifices you'll have to stay consistent and also get in some truly uncomfortable situations that will make you question your sanity,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
JW9J93hrDNE,but if you're down to go through that you can get rich relatively fast at least a lot faster than the traditional route that 98 of people are taking anyways there you have it that is the shortcut to wealth i hope you guys enjoyed the video and if you did make sure to share it with a friend and also like and subscribe for more videos just like this i make a ton of content about personal finance investing and entrepreneurship really my whole goal is to help you guys become financially successful thank you for your time and i'll see you in the next video peace [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E, all right so we all want money and for various reasons but I think the best reason was written by Morgan housel from the psychology of money in that book he wrote money is raised intrinsic value is its ability to give you control over your time now it makes sense that we all want the ability to control our own time AKA be free to do whatever we want in life whenever we want and for as long as we want but in order for you to accumulate enough money for you to have that in life you have to have the right mindsets about money it's not by mindset I mean your education your personal development and your perspective on life Robert kiyazaki from Rich Dad Poor Dad once said that many people are focused too much on the money and not on their greatest wealth which is their education and yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,I really do believe what he says is correct if you focus on your own growth and mindset the money will come naturally as you level up if you focus on money and ignore your personal developments it will be much more difficult to accumulate money but analogy I want to talk about is having better and better tools let's say you are a race car driver so obviously your car the tools that your you know team has when you go to the pit stops those are all super super important right if you want to be a world-class entrepreneur or have really big financial success your tools for making money every single day are super important and it's the same with the race car driver right his car and the tools that his team has they all affect how fast he or she is able to complete a race if I'm a race car driver and I have a Ford Pinto and my Pit Stop crew has like the worst tools in the world then winning a race is going to be a really big uphill battle in fact it's going to be so hard because I'll be competing with people with the best cars the best cruise and the best tools by focusing on your education and your mindset about money you're getting yourself into a Ferrari you're getting yourself better tools a better pit crew,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,and yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,when your tools are better your chances of seeing success become that much better as well so if you've ever read the book secrets of the millionaire mind you you know that it's not enough to be in the right place at the right time you have to be the right person in the right place at the right time which is super true right that's three things that need to be right at the exact same time and if you're not preparing yourself then the chances of this happening are to be quite Frank really low if you acquire a lot of money and your mindset towards money is poor it will quickly disappear just like it has for plenty of people in the past we have tons and tons of celebrities right lottery ticket winners people have inherited a lot of money here's how the average person approaches money they say statements like I'm budgeting and saving my money to put it into things like my savings account my house my car and retirement on the other hand here's how the wealthy approach money they say I'm Building Wealth and allocating money towards future goals like my savings house car and retirement the key difference between these two mindsets is a scarcity mindset versus an abundance mindset you might have heard the same lesson before if you followed Tony Robbins because he has also said more you can cultivate that sense of wealth that sense of abundance in you the more you can feel that sense of joy the more easy it's going to be for you to do financially because you're not going to be in this scarce fearful mode so here's a lesson on mindset that we can all learn from take a look at what Dr Tracy Thomas has said who is a psychologist that earns over a million dollars a year coaching wealthy individuals she said in an interview with Business Insider that the term saving connotates deprivation of the things you really want to do in the moment it's really not attractive or glamorous you can see how this is true because when you're saving for something you're usually sacrificing and taking away from another area of your life so instead of saying that you're saving you can tell yourself that you're allocating money towards your financial goals,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,yes it's subtle but that subtle change in Saving versus allocating really does make a huge difference Jensen Sarah who wrote the book you are a badass and make money has also talked about how language can be a harmful thing for your mindset take a look at what she has to say I back in the day realize that one of the things I said all the time was I can't afford it that was sort of my Mantra I didn't even realized that it was until I started reading self-help books and studying this stuff and so I changed that Mantra from I can't afford it to money flows to me easily and freely this you guys is coming from a person who used to live on 28 000 per year to earning seven figures it might seem crazy to force yourself to say something that you may not believe in right away but it's much better than saying you can't telling yourself that you're Building Wealth will immediately shift your thoughts and actions to move subconsciously towards wealth it's sort of similar to if someone says,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,oh boy here we go again or I've got bad news for you when you hear those things you immediately think of the negative aspect of that situation language is a great source of manifestation and if you use it to your advantage you can achieve your goals not just financially but in all other aspects of your life and then going back to John's example saying that money flows to her makes her feel good and is a shift in Focus towards how she can make money flowed to her right if someone says I've got good news you will think of the potential positive outcome and yeah being optimistic about money is way better than thinking hey I don't deserve money I don't deserve wealth because when you talk like money is limited or not coming towards you it's very likely that that is going to come true oftentimes what you say reveals your true thoughts and beliefs about money for example saying I wish is just another way of saying I'm not in control saying I can't is definitely going to hold you back from achieving that thing because if you go into the situation thinking you can't do it then it won't be a surprise if you actually do fail,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,so yeah being aware of the language you use is very important to being able to change your mindset when it comes to money it really boils down to what you say can either help you or hurt you in the long term financially now when I started realizing the power of what I was telling myself about money I immediately became way more optimistic I started to attract money into my life and yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,I remember one of the first things I got as a present when I started doing better with entrepreneurship was a money tree that my girlfriend friend gave me it was from Ralph's it cost like ten dollars but just the fact that I had something tangible for me to look at something that's supposed to symbolize wealth and money just gave me a little bit more of a push every single day and just made me way more optimistic that money tree as dumb as it sounds really helped me overcome my limiting beliefs about money and it made me realize I can make all the money in the world I have the power to do that now Beyond just having that money tree I'd say that the positive mindset towards money that I talked about earlier is something I did in the past when I would write down my affirmations every single morning everything that I thought about in terms of money I wrote down on paper and if they were holding me back from Building Wealth I'd change it this allowed me to be grateful for what I had but it also gave me the chance to correct my negative thoughts about money it really shifted my mindset to focusing on how I can make the positive affirmations I said true another part of my morning routine that was important towards my mindset was visualization you can visualize the day ahead of you but you can also visualize your your goals Napoleon Hill from Think and Grow Rich talks about visualizing your goals and programming them into your subconscious through Auto suggestions so what I encourage you guys to do is write down a specific goal and give it a deadline and plan of attack and then repeat it daily to yourself until you've programmed your mind this is going to have a tremendous effect on your subconscious and building positive go for it mentality instead of a negative,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,what if mindset so now that we've talked about some of the more philosophical things about money and mindset let's talk about some of the more practical takeaways that you guys can start implementing and doing right now the first thing I'll say is you need to change the way you speak to yourself and others regarding money and what I mean by that is you need to start using a wealth language stop using keywords like wish wants maybe Sunday you know stuff like that because when you talk like that you guys you're basically telling yourself alright the possibilities of this happening are pretty low and it's not that possible that I'm going to get that it also means that you're not confident when it comes to making money or keeping it when you talk like this you're speaking from a scarcity mindset and you're internally telling yourself that the chances of this happening are almost close to zero and I'm not really deserving of having it so yeah have confidence tell yourself I'm gonna go out there I'm gonna make things happen I'm deserving of money I'm deserving of success,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,and I'm deserving of having the best life I can have the next practical takeaway is you want to view your money as chess pieces instead of budgeting for things and like saving for things instead we were going to allocate our money AKA play that chess piece of course when it comes to moving your chess pieces you're not going to just move them randomly you're going to be strategic in the different moves you make so for example I'm putting my Bishop right here because it actually makes sense I'm moving my queen from here to here because I actually have a game plan and yeah if you don't get your mindset right about money you're just gonna have a bunch of Pawns to move around they're gonna be no power plays every single move you do is going to be super basic,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,and yeah if you want to live a life that is spectacularly financially successful you're gonna need that intense functional allocation of your money and that boils down to being intentional with your words intentional with your actions and intentional with what you learn that all will have a great impact on how money moves around you and then lastly we have abundance okay so the Practical takeaway here is you need to think that there is money literally everywhere A lot of people think money is super hard to make I'm going to continue trading my time for money for the rest of my life and that type of mindset is just not going to get you to where you probably want to get to sure there is a time and place for being Frugal I myself was super super Frugal for so many years but while that allowed me to save a little bit of money it actually hindered me from actually making a lot of money and yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
uRq1HdL352E,if there's one thing I could tell my younger self it would be that money is abundant money is everywhere and if you think like this and do the right actions you can attract more money than you ever think was possible towards yourself this type of thinking you guys just really changed my life and I hope that it can change your life as well anyways if you guys have any questions about anything I said make sure to comment your question down below I'll do my best to try to answer as many of these questions as I can or another great things that we can actually have the audience collaborate to answer your questions everyone's take on the money mindset is a little bit different so it's really really helpful to get different perspectives oh and if you guys haven't yet already make sure to get your free stocks down below I'm gonna link Weeble and MooMoo and yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

zyA_aaSRrKE, in this video i'm going to tell you the biggest problem with working a nine-to-five job the typical nine-to-five work week is dying corporate jobs are slowly melting away and people are slowly realizing that they don't need to rely on employer to get paid i hope this video is eye-opening shocking and gives you a new perspective on your career and money in general but you guys i have to say that a nine-to-five job is not inherently bad and it definitely works for a majority of the population however and i must stress however that does not mean that it is right for you it doesn't mean that it's weird to stray from this traditional path and do something that's a little bit more crazy so just a little bit of history about nine to five jobs,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,well the concept of the nine to five job it first started in 1867 in illinois it took a while but in 1926 henry ford started using eight hour work days for some of his employees and then finally in 1938 franklin roosevelt he signed the fair labor standards act of 1938 and this basically made working 40 hours standard anything you worked above 40 hours would be considered overtime so the 8 hour work day really came from a good place because back in those days people would work a lot like they would work 12 hour days so as a result this new rule this new law made it much more manageable for many workers in the united states but seriously you guys this was almost 100 years ago do you realize how much the world has changed since then in my opinion the world is so much more awesome right now than before we have the internet we have outsourcing we have globalization and of course we have new types of jobs that mean you don't have to stick with a nine-to-five job anymore nine-to-five jobs in fields such as manufacturing or labor and other things are probably still needed but in this video i'm focusing more on those corporate careers those very typical nine-to-five jobs that people picture when they think about corporate life one of the biggest problems is that humans just cannot sustain productivity for a long time at all like for example working in an office for eight hours does not guarantee you that you are productive for all those hours in fact research shows that the average employee only has about three hours of actual productivity per day so that literally gives us like five hours of non-productive possibly useless time spent in the office funny story i was talking to one of my friends who actually got an mba online,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,and he did this while working a full-time desk job like he literally told me that he would spend about two to three hours in the morning actually working on stuff for the company and the rest of the time he would just be pretending to do work and working on his masters i was like dang if i was paying someone to work for eight hours and they were only working two three hours i'd probably be really pissed off i mean in his case he was still getting the work done,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,but still it's like that's a lot of unneeded time to be in the office so as you guys can probably tell i have a big problem with the traditional 9 to 5 work week i also have a problem with the fact that many employees are just working to make their bosses more money sure they could be getting experience or they could be learning but a lot of these people they're just they're not doing any of those and certainly you can still learn and gain experience by working for yourself and actually building equity in a company that you own so the solution at least in my opinion is to freelance and work for yourself studies show that self-employed people and people that work for themselves are generally much happier than other people even if they don't know where or when their next paycheck is coming and the biggest part about why they are happier is because of flexibility not like yoga flexibility i'm talking like your day-to-day schedule and things that you have to do during the day i've personally experienced this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,and you guys just waking up and not having to do the same thing over and over again is just so nice that's why i'm such a big proponent of working yourself i mean i've done this for pretty much the entire time i've ever been working i've only worked one nine to five job in my life and that was during a summer when i was in college i worked for a family friend at her mortgage company and yeah it was definitely not fun like the whole routine of waking up in the morning driving to work working having lunch working driving back and then your day is pretty much over it just made me really depressed and i was like i really don't want this to be my life once i graduate college,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,so that's why i have this channel i want to help you guys i want to support you guys and inspire you guys to take these leaps of faith and start working for yourself that most people would be too afraid to do i want to give you guys the tools you need and the knowledge you need in order to become successful working for yourself so let's go over some of the biggest problems with nine to five jobs if you're on salary you're expected to sit at a desk and work for at least eight hours per day sometimes you feel pressured to stay longer sometimes you have unlimited vacation but you just don't want to take actual vacations because you're feeling too much pressure from your co-workers and from your boss you're always trying to impress your boss but likely you're being underpaid not appreciated and overworked you're also just building another person's business the minute you leave yes you have some experience,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,yes you have some knowledge but likely you won't have much equity at all that is unless you're working from one of those tech companies that is giving out a lot of stock options that's when working for a company might be pretty smart but then again that company might not do well and those stock options become worthless you really never know you also have no freedom like if you get fired one day the company is going to replace you with someone else and if the company goes out of business it's something that you really can't control another problem of being in the corporate is that likely i'm not saying for every job out there likely you could get all the work done that you're supposed to in four hours or less but you have to stay there the rest of the day and that leaves no flexibility for your schedule and you might have a terrible work-life balance i don't think the 40-hour workweek is efficient at all and i also think that a lot of people are missing out in life just by sticking with their cushy jobs like think about this you are driving to work in the morning it's 8,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,a.m it's friday you've done this for the last four days and you're just looking forward to getting off having two days of relaxation and then just starting the whole process over again now to me that sounds terrible but i mean some people i think they're gonna like that if you don't like that though then there is another way to live working for yourself gives you more freedom you'll have a boss your boss is yourself and ultimately you decide how many results you get and how hard you work the number of hours you work really has little significance at all it's all about your performance now a recent study by metlife showed that 57 of employees want to go into freelance and also 77 of millennials would prefer to work for themselves so there is a lot of interest at least in people's heads but the numbers show otherwise people tend to fall into normal employment because you know it's just the traditional way you make more money at the start yes,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,and you are way less likely to fail now whenever i hate on these nine-to-five jobs people are always like hey what about the bonuses what about the benefits what about the stability you know honestly i just don't give a [ __ ] about that i know that i can just make more money to pay for those things myself and there really is no ceiling to my income although i will say that most starting entrepreneurs they're going to be a lot more poor than people working a traditional 9 to 5 job at least at the very start that's definitely how it was for me when i first graduated college i was an entrepreneur and i was not making that much money like my friends in consulting and other better nine-to-five jobs they were making way more money than me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,but if you are a good entrepreneur there is going to be a time where you start to surpass their incomes and you start making a boatload of money but plus you guys it goes way beyond the money like for real the freedom the freedom is where it's at that is the most amazing part about working for yourself and honestly you cannot trade freedom for any type of money but for real though you know it's okay to stay with your nine-to-five job especially if you're starting out as an entrepreneur stay with your job keep those benefits but when you get home or maybe when you're working and you have some down time start working on those side hustles i'm just asking you guys to evaluate and consider what type of life you really want to live so if you've been hating on your nine-to-five job if you've been hating on your 40-hour work week stop hating on it and just do something about it i make tons of content about how you can get into side hustles how you can start building your own business and this all stemmed from my personal experience like when i graduated college i went straight into working for myself i can say without a doubt that i love my life i love my everyday schedule and i would not change one thing about it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
zyA_aaSRrKE,see i hope this video can inspire you guys to go out there and chase what you want because just know it is possible so yeah those are my thoughts about nine to five jobs and the typical 40 hour work week sorry if this video was kind of everywhere i just had a lot of thoughts that i just wanted to put into a video so hopefully you guys found it informative and hopefully you take this information and do something that changes your life if you did enjoy the video make sure to hit that like button and also subscribe to my channel if you want to see more videos just like this i make a ton of content about personal finance investing in entrepreneurship so that's it for today thank you so much and i'll see you guys in the next video [Music] peace [Music] you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM, foreign [Music] [Music] there's a hundred different reasons why you're broke but if we come through that list from bottom to top there's one reason that is singularly more impactful than everything else this one reason is why it's so tough to save money and is the cause of you living paycheck to paycheck the problems that most people focus on the 99 other reasons but they don't focus on the first due to procrastination so let's talk about that being broke is expensive and as a result it's tough to climb out picture it this way you're down there and up there is where you want to be but you're stuck down there and you don't know how to get out there's no easy ladders set up for you to just climb and the problem is being down there costs a lot of money we have high interest loans the inability to invest paying for cheap stuff that breaks often it all makes being poor really expensive so what can you actually do about it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,well yes you can save five dollars a day by skipping out on your Starbucks order you can buy a cheaper car that gets 40 miles per gallon you can even eat rice and beans all day but the real problem isn't going to be solved by being Frugal and saving more money the real problem is your income okay so your income is defined as money received especially on a regular basis for work or through Investments now saying you need to increase your income seems like an almost stupid idea to put forth because dot everyone knows that how much money you make correlates extremely well with how much money you can actually accumulate and how far away from broke you are but I really want to put this thought in the spotlight because too many people out there are emphasizing the saving aspect of getting rich but yeah you guys from personal experience saving doesn't actually do too much eight years ago I was absolutely broke but at the same time I was so Frugal,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,right I was so aware of what I was spending my money on my mind would focus entirely on how I could maximize every dollar remove every cent of spending stuff like that like it was almost a disease I just remember thinking how long am I going to stay broke for if I'm so financially smart with my spending it's funny to think back because the main reason why I was broke was because I wasn't prioritizing increasing my income which I think is more common than we think it's really really hard to increase your income and so what we basically do is we procrastinate and focus on all the things underneath that which in my opinion are much simpler and easier to do this is exactly what I was doing from 2014 after I graduated college until around 2017.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,I was working random gigs to make money but the majority of my focus was actually on being as Frugal as possible in 2017 I started to level my income up while still being as Frugal as possible and guess what that was the first year where I didn't feel like I was super broke 2018 was even better 2019 was even better again and each year the ratio of my mental energy shifted with the Frugal part shrinking and the make more money part actually increasing and so the reason I'm telling you this is because why while I do want you to be frugal I do want you to save a lot of money I don't think your whole identity should be based on that this puts severe reinforcing pressure on the main cause of why most people are and stay broke which is that their total income is just not enough okay so cool we talked about all that stuff but now I think it'd be really good to actually talk about some ways to increase your income,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,because yeah if I ended this video with hey guys you need to make more money that's it like And subscribe that would be super lame and just not useful at all so I'll share three different things in particular that I've learned over the past five years which is the time frame when my income saw the most year over year growth and you guys can basically take these things and Implement them into your own life they're pretty simple Concepts but hard to actually Implement yeah if you can force yourself to actually Implement these things I guarantee you it's going to increase your income as well but before we talk about the next points I want to introduce a free course I just launched that you guys can get access to right now it's called affiliate marketing Mastery and it's my free course teaching you how to build a successful affiliate marketing business it's super super busy are friendly and we'll cover secrets that I Implement in my own affiliate marketing business that does about a million dollars of Revenue per year it's completely free this video doesn't have a real sponsor,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,and I just sort of wanted to tell you guys about my own free course so that link is going to be down below in the description okay so the first concept that I want to talk about is that you need to stop working so hard on things that are guaranteed let me explain this a little bit more clearly because I know this is sort of a weird concept nothing you do that's guaranteed will ever make you super rich becoming a doctor will not make you super rich working the nine to five is likely not going to make you super rich simply showing up and doing something that already guarantees you X dollars per hour or whatever it is is not going to get you super rich anything that has a guaranteed outcome can be good but it's not going to be amazing or great and that's why I always encourage some risk taking guys you probably are already working really hard if you're watching this video then you likely care about your finances you likely hustle in a sense,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,yeah I'd say that most people out there they work really hard at things and that's because a lot of jobs are really hard they require a sacrifice they require a lot of time and they're super draining but,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,the difference between being broke and being rich is this being rich requires you to work on things that could have a good or bad outcome for example showing up at a job that pays you forty thousand dollars a year guarantees you that salary every week you show up you'll make about 800 or so and if you show up to work you're not playing with the possibility of you know one week losing 800 and then the next week making 1600 it's just that flat 800 a week one simple outcome now something with more upside is always going to involve some type of risk which means there are multiple outcomes possible you can have a loss a net neutral a positive and an extreme positive for example take any sales or commission based job in 2017 I got my real estate license because I knew I could crush it if I could do well but on the flip side a sales job like that could pay you zero dollars if it's entirely Performance Based for example if you sell zero homes you lose money after fees if you sell one home maybe you'll break even or profit a little bit in a year if however you sell a hundred homes you've likely made millions of dollars every hour you're working you really don't know how much you're making in a bad month maybe it's zero dollars an hour in a good month maybe it's hundreds of dollars per hour because that uncertainty is there it means our earning potential is extremely high so even though real estate sort of fizzled out for me I continue to go on trying to make new businesses most of them with a net neutral or small positive outcome that is until I finally built one that did extremely well which is my online education business that you guys are currently watching which did about 2.4 million dollars in Revenue last year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,and so I think the takeaway is that if you want to make more money you gotta take some risks and you gotta Embrace a bit of uncertainty work hard on things that are uncertain because uncertainty keeps rewards High that's the first big concept I wanted to talk about and that sort of leads us to the second concept which is you need to acquire skills a lot people out there especially people that watch entrepreneurship content they like to focus on trying to build a business they want to focus on chasing money but they do it without any sort of foundation the foundation is actually all the skills you're using to generate income and so if you spend your time just trying to build a business or trying to build passive income just because those things are you know sexy but you yourself are not particularly skilled then yeah that's going to be extremely tough if you're young,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,and you're watching this video you have a lot of time to learn skills plus the resources they're literally everywhere spend your 20s building businesses not necessarily to make money but to learn things in doing that I guarantee you you're gonna not only learn things but also make a lot of money yeah basically I spent my 20s trying business after business and I'd say I tried almost everything at the start I was too focused on you know just making money instead of focusing on learning and acquiring skill sets but over time I realized that I should be taking notes every day I should be reading every single day I should use YouTube not for entertainment but to actually learn things and what you'll notice is that once you develop a certain amount of skills life will become incredibly easier you'll be able to spot opportunities better you'll be able to trade your time for money if you want and make a lot or you can even find opportunities that generate you passive income sort of like being a Swiss army knife that can handle anything that's thrown at it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,so with this you know I want to say prioritize high value skills and there are so many high value skills out there low value skills should definitely be avoided these are skills that anyone can do or learn easily so rather focus on harder skills that require training and education right supply and demand really dictates that you'll be paid way more simply because there's fewer people that know how to do that skill and you can eventually use leverage to build an entire business around that skill I will say that you'll likely hit your big break as the result of one main skill so yesterday I interviewed a ton of millionaires and they all said to focus on one thing and build your initial money that way it's true that most of your income will come from one thing right that's going to be the high value skill that creates your initial Fortune after that you Branch off into other businesses but I don't want you guys to confuse that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,with oh you should only build one skill when you're young no build a lot of skills and how it's going to play out is one of those skills that you're learning will make you a millionaire but again you still need all these supporting skills around it yeah again building a business doesn't necessarily mean you're going to make money but building and acquiring skills that's going to pay dividends for the rest of your life okay the third concept we're talking about is you need to prioritize money money is not reserved for the one percent you can absolutely get it too the thing is the one percent spend a lot of their energy thinking about money it tends to you know sort of consume their lives now you don't need to make your life all about money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,but I will say you should absolutely prioritize it more read books on finances investing taxes go ask your boss for a raise go start a side hustle to generate money on the side go do more things that put more money into your pocket money is not something that sort of just shows up at your doorstep you really need to put yourself on its route first and then that's when more of it's going and get delivered to you the more brain power and effort you put into something the more you're going to get in return and so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,no I don't think you can make more money without sacrificing more of your time or more of your mental brain power just allocate more of that energy towards money and more money is going to sort of show up I also do think we need to remove the stigma around talking about money right this encourages people to not openly discuss their money issues or bounce ideas off friends about how to save more how to make more or how to invest more money we've already seen more and more people openly talk about pay for example salary transparent Street I really do enjoy watching their videos as well as the videos of a lot of other creators like that and I think it's a great move in the right direction okay so in conclusion the only way you'll ever escape being broke is by increasing your income your current income probably is not enough to get you out of the paycheck to paycheck cycle you can become a better saver but the real needle mover is what you actually get paid but seriously I'm just the guy on the internet I still have so much to learn,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
5VpCuLGeUyM,but that's sort of my take on why most people people are broke and what they need to do to get out of it if this video can help even just a handful of you guys reset your priorities then it'll all have been worth it oh and check out the links down below if you guys do want to get some free stocks from Weeble and MooMoo they're giving out a ton of free stocks if you just sign up and fund your account and if you guys know me you know that I love investing and these platforms can help you build a lot of wealth anyways if you guys enjoyed the video make sure to hit that like button and also subscribe for more content just like this I make tons of videos about personal finance entrepreneurship and investing thank you so much for your time and I'll see you in the next video peace thank you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM, hey guys in this video i'm going over seven things you absolutely have to know before successfully quitting your job it's scary and exciting and there's a lot you can do to prepare if you guys follow these tips i guarantee you one you'll have a better game plan for making money two negate your risks and three drastically increase your success rate in entrepreneurship these are the things that i wish i knew and yeah stay until the end and this video will have a huge impact on your future success let's get started so the first thing i want to say is that the possibilities are endless after you quit really there is so much potential for creating change in the world as well as gaining financial freedom entrepreneurs are just way more likely to become millionaires and the data supports this only 18 of american households are headed by self-employed people but they are four times more likely to be millionaires so,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,yeah as you can see there are a lot of millionaires that are self-employed but even with all this data it seems like a lot of people are hesitant when it comes to you know working for themselves they think it's just more risky but actually i'd think the opposite when you're working for a company they could basically go down or fire you at any point i'd rather be more responsible for the success of my own company and sort of be more in control that way before you quit your job you should definitely know that the possibilities are endless once you take charge of your own destiny now when it comes to my own personal experience working a 9 to 5 versus building my own businesses i found that the latter was just so much better now personally i've just been so much happier building my own businesses rather than working a nine-to-five job the only nine-to-five job i ever worked was working for a mortgage company back when i was in college i just found the whole experience pretty soldering,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,and i was just completely bored all the time however when it comes to working for myself i'm just way more excited about it it's awesome being able to think that i'm building something that i own myself if you look at the studies they also show that self-employed people are happier they show that if you're an employee you need to earn 2.5 times as much money to be as happy as someone who's self-employed and that seems about right if someone were to offer me two options one making way more money as an employee versus making less and doing what i'm doing right now i'll definitely choose the latter and guys there are a million ways to be successful in entrepreneurship for example you have under armour who actually targets those that don't want sweaty clothes when they exercise you have purple and although they are a mattress business their niche is actually in the creative content space where they use creative content marketing to drive organic traffic online you have lefties who actually sells products for people that are left-handed you have nomadic who targets travelers and remote workers you have content creators online coaches copywriters virtual assistants bookkeepers really the list is endless in terms of what you can do with entrepreneurship,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

gTrq65yuHeM,yeah this just shows that you can build a successful business in pretty much any area in conclusion i want to say that the possibilities with entrepreneurship are so great and that the choices and directions you can take while building your business are not limited at all the next thing you guys should know is that some types of businesses take a long time to make money and some types are much faster i always recommend picking the faster options successful millionaires tend to start businesses that they think are going to make money they look for areas of big demand and small supply also some industries are over 600 times more likely to be successful than others so while it might seem obvious to carefully choose your business idea it's surprising that a majority of people don't actually spend too much time on this part of their business 63 percent of new business owners admit that their venture does not have any type of competitive advantage and only a third say that they really did a deep search for a good business idea what this shows is that it's really important to do your research and to choose a business type that will be profitable i'm actually going to link below some of the top business ideas that i think are perfect for 2022 and beyond and doing any of these is going to make you way more likely to be successful,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,but yeah in summary we're talking about things like internet-based businesses or service-based businesses that you can scale this includes things like consulting copywriting coaching creating digital products making blogs doing a personal brand ecommerce really the list is endless in general you'll want to build a high value skill and offer that skill as a service to clients having that high value skill allows you to actually have a sort of barrier to entry right like selling t-shirts to anyone is pretty tough because anyone can do it however learning a really useful skill like helping companies set up their productivity platforms that's going to be a much better business idea because not too many people know how to do that the business idea you choose is really the foundation of your entrepreneurship journey so i really encourage you guys to be intentional with what you choose choose a market that's growing that has grown demand and also try and make sure that there is a small supply right so if you have that high demand but that small supply that really is a winning formula,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,and i mentioned this earlier but some industries are just way more likely for you to succeed than others i recommend checking google trends and making sure that the demand for that service or type of business is growing and not shrinking the next thing you need to consider before quitting is do you have reserves or cash flow if not consider building income before you quit your job really the golden rule is to save at least three to six months worth of living expenses so that you have financial peace of mind when leaving a job to pursue a passion a lot of people are going to tell you that new businesses often take a while to see profit and that is true some businesses might also require additional startup costs that you might not expect so it really is important that you have enough saved for a rainy day now actually i recommend for most people to actually keep their job until they have started seeing traction from a side hustle or business that they are doing the reason for this is because you know sometimes it does take three to six months sometimes it can even take longer for your business to see traction,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,and you really have no idea how long it's gonna take when you start so it can be risky if you're low on money what i recommend is if you don't already have a side hustle now might be a good time to actually start looking for one because after you quit your job you'll want some type of cash flow so that you're not just relying on your reserves for those three to six months or longer the great thing is that you can actually do a side hustle while building your main business right so that's exactly what i did for so many years until i saw success it really did save my butt and i just did a ton of high paying side hustles like tutoring and photography to pay the bills while i was working on my bigger businesses that were not profitable if you can bring immediate cash flow like that then it makes leaving your job much easier,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,and yeah don't be scared to actually try different side hustles that's what really allowed me to find my passions and who knows one of those side hustles could turn into a full-on business in the future so keep your mind open to all these opportunities the next thing you need to know is that you have to have a niche the biggest mistake that a ton of people do including myself is making a business that's super general that targets way too many people when you're doing this it becomes very very hard to succeed unless you have an absolute gigantic marketing budget for example for my first big business charge athletics i made the big mistake of not having a usp and niche usb stands for unique selling points and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,yeah there's nothing really special about my clothes there wasn't really anything that differentiated from other companies and as a result i did not have a niche or a specific group of people that i was targeting with the brand and this really allows you to immediately differentiate and have a much higher conversion rate with your audience for example let's take a look at two companies one company makes t-shirts for everyone and another makes t-shirts for bmw enthusiasts there's no reason for anyone to really buy that t-shirt that is for everyone because you know there are probably millions of companies selling the exact same t-shirt however when you look at the company that is specifically devoted to bmw enthusiasts that is a much much better niche and something that people are actually going to buy finding the niches actually helped so many companies become successful including one of my friends who actually had an seo marketing agency that was you know pretty general they weren't seeing much success there was no traction,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,but then one day he actually converted that seo marketing agency into one that was devoted towards life science companies literally the moment he did that the success of his company skyrocketed they got way more clients and it makes a lot of sense why why hire a general seo company when you can hire a company that is focused on your business's niche that's basically what i mean when it says it's going to drastically increase your conversions it's going to make an even bigger difference later on when you actually do organic and paid marketing because it's gonna make it much more easy for you to target a specific audience or business but that's a whole different conversation and we won't get into that in this video a general rule i like to say is that your future business should have a target audience that involves less than ten percent of the population and yeah i'd say that anything between two to ten percent is a really good place to be,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,so yeah before you quit make sure you understand what your niche is going to be in and don't create a general business next up is you need to understand the importance of building a circle of friends who are also entrepreneurs now based on my own life from ages 0 to 27 i was only around non-entrepreneurs i grew up in the very education-focused city of palo alto in northern california i went to ucla and majored in psychobiology and as a result 99 of my friends also want to go down that traditional career path then in 2019 i actually moved to costa mesa california and i was surrounded by a completely new set of people i remember thinking hey doing entrepreneurship surrounded by you know traditional career people was pretty tough,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,so i really need to prioritize actually finding entrepreneurs to hang out with now i'd say that around 80 to 90 of the people i talk to or hang out with actually work for themselves and that has been a complete game changer entrepreneurship is really lonely and it's even lonelier if your friends can't relate to your struggles or you can't bounce ideas off of them so an actionable that i will give you guys right now is to go out and actually find entrepreneur friends check out your local meetups you know look on social media groups dm people on instagram you know find friends of friends this is super important and something that you should definitely be doing before you actually quit your job if you pursue entrepreneurship alone there is a chance you'll quit after some roadblocks if you're not alone on this journey however you won't quit it's also going to make you way more likely to be successful and the main reason for this is because of masterminding i've learned so much from my friends and i'll be nowhere near as close to where i am today if it weren't for them for example i was inspired by my girlfriend's mom janelle she worked her butt off to create a really successful medical aesthetics practice here in southern california and seeing the life that she built for her family was super inspiring i have tons of career friends who you know i bounce ideas off of all the time we learn from each other about what works and what doesn't work my friends like carlton who i met in this apartment building and he got me completely hooked on tax strategy which of course has been a complete game changer really your network gives you a huge competitive advantage for example i'm starting up a blog right now and one of my friends ryan scribner is actually a pro blogger and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,yeah i can hop on a call with them asking questions and as a result i'm just way more likely to succeed because you know i have mentors helping me there is a saying that says you are who you surround yourself with and this is extremely true when it comes to having friends that are entrepreneurs if you hang around five entrepreneurs you're gonna become the sixth entrepreneur and if you hang around five employees then chances are you'll become an employee too,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,so yeah go out there find other entrepreneurs who positively influence and inspire you to be the best version of yourself you'll definitely be happy that you did next you must understand the importance of investing time and slash or money into self-education entrepreneurship is like being in school again except now you're learning real life skills that will help you make money really the key word here is learning because stagnant entrepreneurs don't learn they just do and do and do with no learning learning is crucial because it actually changes your behavior your decisions and your mindset so before you quit you need to understand that you're going to have to place a big emphasis on your self-education you'll need to read books you have to be open to you know getting mentored getting coached you'll need to attend conferences you'll need to watch educational youtube videos really anything that helps you increase your skills and your knowledge this is super important because this is something that no no one can take away from you once you have skills and once you have knowledge you'll have it forever skills really are the reason why tons of successful entrepreneurs can you know go broke tomorrow and then easily become a millionaire again in a year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,so yeah if you aren't already keep acquiring new skills and keep seeking new opportunities to learn otherwise you're just going to be selling yourself short of reaching your full potential i sort of like to think of it as a video game and you are this character that comes into the world with little to no skills and the only way to progress is to actually buy upgrades or spend the time grinding out to earn the experience points to level up it's really the same thing in real life and that's why i place such a big emphasis on self-education so yeah before you guys quit have this mindset with learning right be excited about it the more you know the more opportunities you'll have and the more successful you'll be next up is something extremely important and that is the start to learn marketing this one is big and lots of people think that these small details in their business are more important right like your website uh the font you're using the packaging the logo all that stuff,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,what i'm gonna tell you guys is that none of that is as important as marketing and i promise that from a personal experience with my company charge athletics i actually lost over 20 000 just due to the fact that i did not know how important marketing was i spent all this time making sure that the clothes were perfect you know making sure the packaging was great the website all that stuff but i totally neglected to spend any time effort or money on marketing the brand now that sounds weird but if there's only one thing you could do for your next business it would be to market starting cafe it's all about marketing starting a copywriting agency marketing clothing brand,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,it's all about marketing if you guys place emphasis on marketing you're gonna have the money from sales or business to actually invest in your company to build a better website better product all that stuff when you're focusing on all those unimportant details you're actually procrastinating from doing the things that are most important and that is getting business or sales and that comes from marketing i will say it's definitely a huge shift from going from an employee to a founder before you likely did not have to actually get the business in right you just had to fulfill it now unfortunately you have to do both now one specific subset of marketing that i think is going to apply to everyone watching this video is personal branding if you've seen any of my other videos you'll know that i'm super big on personal branding it can help you start any business with a much greater chance of success this is basically just marketing for yourself which equates to marketing for your business i cannot emphasize how much personal branding has changed my own life and that's why i talk about so much in my videos right anyone an introvert extrovert poor rich we all have a great shot at building a personal brand and a lot of people just don't realize how much of a difference this can have on your entrepreneurial journey it really is unfair because now i can start a business tomorrow and have a 10 times higher chance of success versus me five years ago and the main difference is because you know those skills of course but also because now i have a personal brand if you guys actually want to learn how to build your own personal brand i have my own flagship program called the personal brand master class it is six weeks long you get your own success coach live q a calls and our own community where you can talk with other like-minded people,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,and yeah we are open for enrollment so if you are interested i will put a link in the description below like i mentioned already you do not have to be an extrovert to be good at marketing marketing is not only just cold calling or attending conferences to drum up business in 2022 and beyond there are so many great forms of marketing that exist for us introverts for example creating youtube videos like this yes i am sitting by myself talking to a camera doing instagram or tick tock creating content on linkedin or even doing copywriting or online ads there really is no excuse to not prioritize marketing and whatever you're about to do otherwise it's just like shooting yourself in the foot before a marathon anyways i hope you guys found this video helpful and my whole goal really is to give people the resources they need to live the life that they want and reach financial success everything i talk about stems from my own personal experience with entrepreneurship and how blessed i am because of it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
gTrq65yuHeM,so i really hope you guys are thinking why is this guy trying so hard to get me to quit my job i'm not trying to do that there is a reason why you guys clicked on this video i just want to help you guys make your desires in actual reality anyways if you guys want some free stuff i will link down below you guys can get some free stocks and crypto and also if you guys enjoyed the video make sure to share it with a friend and also hit that like button and subscribe for more videos just like this i make a ton of content about personal finance entrepreneurship and investing thanks for stopping by and i'll see you guys in the next video peace [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,you may remember a time on YouTube when YouTube was ran by a different type of business advice guide and it's ran by today now you may know me as the most woke empty house business advice guy but I don't want to lie I don't want to act like a saint I was a part of this type of business advice guy group and this was the full house business advice guy group back in the day these full house business advice guys they would they would lure people in with their extremely full house is full of couches television sets and in some cases fish ponds fish they're all under here this is where I read you know I like to read a book and stuff like that and using their very luxurious fish ponds private jets and cars they would create mass amounts of attention and hysteria for their form of business advice just people would line up for the miles for great lengths of distance to see their business advice on stage they would come on stage with fireworks and give business advice and it was thought till the end of time that showmanship and private jets and fancy cars and fish ponds or the way that businesses were built and then one man decided to stand up he said no I don't like avocado,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,toast no I don't want to pay extra money on my car insurance no those point zero zero one percent credit card fees are not acceptable this man was Graham Stephen he stood up and he ended this error in one fell swoop from his duplex and he took down the error of full business expensive business advice guys and brought both the error of not expensive reasonable life business advice guys yes Graham Stephen is the number one most acceptable reasonable reasonable business advice guy on YouTube and I'd like to discuss him in this video okay guys I'm looking at Graham's last video that aired five days ago just a pretty average video 631 k views if you take and if you take Gary V's last video from five days ago 100k views grant cardones highest in the last week 37 cabe use Tai Lopez's 11 K views and Dan lobster cabe use you don't even have half of one guy sitting in a duplex talking about business and money and finances and I got to tell you it's just it's just funny to me there's three lessons you should really take away from this,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,and that's basically what I want to talk about in this video and those three things are first up why it worked and how Graham did this and I don't think he'd mastermind in this but it's the epipheo of how popular opinion in and attention goes to why I think it's a really good thing overall and in theory what you can learn from it so first off how did Graham do this just from my point of view it's really simple so first off views and attentions are not are not bank statements so I'm not I'm not saying that in this video at all however if we go look at Graham Stephen and all of us actually real subscribers on his channel and then you look at all the marketers and all the Guru's who are screaming and posting on Instagram and going nuts and just doing anything to get attention it's really really really clear what people prefer and what type of advice and help they actually relate to you,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,and they're actually getting benefit from well other people are you they have camera crews falling around they're taking all these professional videos they're doing all this nutty stuff they're put in private jets behind Grahams just sitting in his duplex which from what his videos I've dug in to cost him like zero dollars a month and brags about his lifestyle cost him like 200 bucks a month I'm just quoting I don't has videos where he breaks out then it's extremely cheap and people relate to this more because it's actually helpful it's actually relatable and they can actually get immediate benefit from it and it's just really funny cuz like people realize they're like we've been watching the Kardashians this isn't helpful this isn't helping and simply by being normal Graham completely wiped out everybody who's trying to be something that they're not there were these year periods where it's just everyone was obsessed with people giving big business advice and flashy stuff,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,and it's really kind of just so you could just see it in the numbers what a bad taste that left in so many people's mouths you can also see that with rise of channels like copy Zilla channels which is blowing up right now and it really showed that in a time period where there was so much hyperbole and let's just say not authenticity for lack of better words that just being authentic super honest and realistic was the way to go and what Graham did it was really special as when everybody was going this way I don't think he master - he was just over here being himself and as more and more people got kind of put off over here very like moved over here and I think this is a really good thing overall because in my opinion during that time period being an entrepreneur was like sexy it was like being a rapper or something like that and I don't think everyone's cut out to be an entrepreneur and I'm not saying it like not everyone's cut out to be legit like me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,I'm not saying at all not everyone's cut out to be an accountant not everyone set up to be a not everyone's set up to be a UFC fighter not everyone is set to be a cook everybody's different and entrepreneurs are a very specific type of person and they're not the only type of people to make money on earth I don't say you have to be successfully an entrepreneur but in this time period everyone's being told they can be an entrepreneur from people who just talked about and in this time period everyone was being told they should be an entrepreneur and it was really kind of the rise of Instagram and social media and influencers in the first place and so everybody saw this is like this is what an entrepreneur is and then over about a period of three years when people are all looking at this and following this stuff and like none of it really it was everyone was this kind of clueless still after three years like what the what the hell is actually going on here people kind of said whoa you know I'm gonna go back to the basics,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,and I frankly think if a person is able to learn how to manage their finances and invest successfully that's way more beneficial and people learned this hopped into it it was way way way more beneficial for them and so Gramp literally there's this big ball of polarization right here that was spitting people out left in general he just collected all of them I think it's just really funny and the thing you should really take away from this to wrap this all up is that there's a video that I watched from Jason Cohen who I interviewed I would say like three or four weeks ago his company at least must be valued at a billion dollars by now and he made a video that the best way to stand out in a marketplace of hyperbole and if you look at like almost every form of marketing I'm not saying anyone's lying I'm not going after anyone right here if you look at any form of marketing when it comes to like even fruit juice for example it says 100% natural,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,then you look on the back and has like natural flavors that are all like red number five and some of that lying is almost just the default in marketing these days everybody says best thing ever created in their titles most important if you look at people's Facebook career listings right there lives like 15 different jobs investor council persons but Senate member like just ridiculous titles all in there when they don't even own a successful business and in a world of hyperbole the number one way to stand out is just to be extremely honest and Jason warning thing he pointed out in this is that people that actually left their bad reviews under their products on Amazon and on their websites I think Canon did this with their cameras they actually left their bad reviews on cameras they actually did they actually did significantly more sales don't quote me but like 2x more sales than they did before,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,and so what you should take away from this is that avoiding being flashy and being very straight up with who you are what you do and what you don't do is perhaps the number one way to stand out long term and marketing as you've seen grams use has gone doodoo and everybody else's views it go do so they start off with this massive Sun like attention polarization and it didn't keep anyone long-term but you can see right here the slow burn that Graham did work significantly better and so long story short I think Graham's really cool,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,but this is also video just kind of like what you can learn from it if you look at this right here a lot of people when they get in the business their pressure to do all sorts of hyperbole all sorts of flash make crazy claims what you should really be focusing on and what's actually helped my business and marketing more as being just straight-up about what you do and what you don't do and very very and being very very clear of what you can do because when you do that you can communicate with the people that you want to sell to and you can actually helps so much better,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
p5wSRjaQsnE,and you can keep their attention for a long time and keep them interacting with your business for a long long time that's it that's that's all I really got I just some interesting thoughts I had on this if you like videos like this life subscribe hit the notification bell because I give away all my old courses that I used to sell and a post every single week that I keep up for three to four hours if you want to see that post and get the algorithm show it to you you gotta really tell algorithm to show it to you by hitting like notification bell subscribe I'll see you next video [Music] [Music] the trigger [Applause] [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?, all right look guys i don't want to be the one i don't want to want to be the i don't want to be the one to lay this this hot take on you i feel like the guy who's telling you that your dog is going to die someday it's going to we both know it's true but we also both know that bitcoin is going to crash it's going to crash hard you're probably wondering you know alex how do you know this well i am the number one whale in the marketplace if you look at almost all of the bitcoin uh being held right now there's this one wall right here that holds a lot of it that's that's me how do you know that's me i don't have to prove myself to you which channel you think this is but i'm going to tell you in this video what the crash is probably going to look like also i know you guys think i'm a genius and you're very tempted to get all your life decisions from a guy covered in tattoos wearing a tank top screaming profanity on the internet,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
#NAME?,so i have to say this so you don't put all your life savings into me this is not financial advice it's just me saying my computer talking about stuff okay and why am i telling you this because if you are getting into bitcoin you're getting in the cryptocurrency right now you probably have this weird view of how the crash is going to happen and it's probably not going to happen like that i can tell you that straight up because when i first got in i bought in march around like five thousand six thousand dollars i always thought bitcoin would just it was like a good old game of uh roulette to get old game a bust of it just goes up and up and up and up and just that's not what it's gonna look like and a lot of times when bitcoin is going up really fast that's when my incentive early on was to buy more of it whenever whenever bitcoin's shooting off i'm like oh this is a sure thing i could just just be in this pot and gold's gonna come out the other side,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and it's gonna be fantastic it's gonna be magical well you know i learned that lesson pretty pretty bad uh on the first major dip especially when i bought like ethereum at thirteen hundred dollars and then sold it at like 1150 okay granted i was still in substantial gains at that time but it was a stupid move okay and the reason why i made that stupid move and lost a ton of money there is because i don't i didn't understand what a bitcoin crash is likely to look like and if you understand what the crash is going to look like you're going to also understand that when bitcoin crashes it's not even close to the end of the market for example if you look all the way back to 2017 ethereum didn't even really get it didn't really even get fully aroused until bitcoin crashed okay really ethereum is like that that weird guy at the club that waits for his attractive friend to leave and then he just he's just going nuts,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,okay when bitcoin takes its first really hard hit and by the way it's taking like 30 40 dips i guess that's that's technically a hard hit right this this market's stupid but technically when bitcoin takes its hard hit that's that's when you want to be be going even deeper in ethereum and all coins and really it's when the alt coins crash that the market's over but let's just kind of review this real quick because i think you need a look at this and this is going to help you maybe sleep at night,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
#NAME?,and it's also going to help you not get owned also if you like talking crypto follow me at cssbecker on twitter we also mint these videos on openc every single time i do one and you can buy the first ping comment on the video in fact the last guy who bought it is that like a ten thousand zillion percent roi you can also buy some of my luxury art have you seen white square sold for 12 cents and is now going for 200 this is definitely a sign that this market is at his top i'm just letting you know a link to my fine art and my horrible tweets is on twitter at css becker you should check it out okay guys so the reason why i'm shooting this video is this is pretty common knowledge uh to crypto traders everybody knows this the problem is 95 of people again crypto aren't crypto traders okay they don't know what they're looking at okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and so if we go look at where we're at right now let me just zoom out to the the charts we're looking at let's look at just i don't know like the last few months okay so this is where we're at right now with with bitcoin's price we've been growing from 13 000 to 30 and there's a dip you you've got to understand when you get into this what you're expecting to happen is this is exactly what i expected happened at 40 000 when it was just going up i expected bitcoin to go like this is going to be one big major dip okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and a lot of people absolutely pee their pants in these dips right here now i talked about this last video on how expecting 30 to 40 dips in bitcoin is a good thing it's it's actually what you want to look for because what happens right here is if these dips don't happen what's going to happen is people get so far in the profit then they're all going to sell it once and it's going to take a mass of them so for example everybody who bought like right here at this point right here was in massive profit at this point right here almost 95 of people 98 of people that held bitcoin were in profit okay and so if this kept going higher the amount of profit that would be on the table would be just be too juicy to resist and we're going to have someone sell up here,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and it's going to trigger all sorts of crashes going all the way down this is what's called that's why it's called the correction the price needs to be corrected and it's caused by too many people being in profit now i'm not going to give you some high level trader analysis right here i'm just going to tell you what you need to be looking for and when you need to start being a little bit more nervous because when we see something like this happening i actually get a lot more excited these days like when this happened right here i was very nervous when we were right here i was much more confident when we're right here and the reason for that is because people aren't in profit anymore,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,so people are going to hold their bitcoin they're going to hold their their cryptocurrency and they're going to try and make a profit on because that's the goal here people don't want to sell it a loss and so when people go and take profits right here push it back down to this area right here it allows other people to buy in at this price right here for example 44 000 and what it's then going to do is these people are at 44 000 so these people are going to hold this thing until 80 000. they want to 2x their money at least okay so this is what allows us to keep climbing up up and over again and so you need to understand look at this chart right here compared to 2017. right so this is the crash right here and the best thing you can do if you're getting in the crypto right now is know your crypto history let me go and pump this out just a little bit further so check this out we're looking at 2017 right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and so you might see something actually really similar happening right here here's 2017 this is right after the last halving and we saw bitcoin go from uh in november to like 700 to the middle of the year almost up to 1300 so almost doubling okay almost just like we've seen right now okay and we're seeing these these growth patterns right here where it goes from 2000 to all the way up to 3 000. so it creates by nearly 30 right here and it went up even more and so we're seeing really similar uh amounts of growth okay the same you know very similar what's happening right now and we're also seeing again these same dips right here you're seeing these large dips where it goes from 2600 all the way down to 2000 you know that's almost a that's almost a 25 dip right there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,so what's the crash going to look like well look at this pattern right here remember when i talked about too many people getting in profit and again this isn't because i'm a crypto trading whiz kid i want to stress on this channel while i do have funny egocentrical intros i i've only been in crypto for a year you know i'm a really new trader and while i'm really up right now and i've made some excellent trades you know i'm sitting here learning with you and this is this is the stuff that i learned and so you see like right here before we even got to the end of the bitcoin bull run there's a massive correction right here you know huge dips from 7 000 forward all the way down there and then what happened right here look what happened let's let's zoom in on the end of the the bitcoin bull run,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,okay we went from 7 000 to eighteen thousand nearly a three x actually the peak right here nearly a three x roi in the span of a few months um and this right here people say that the bull run was ended because you could finally short bitcoin i i personally believe it was ended because literally everyone who had bought was in such high profit that the second someone really did the first big dump bubba bam,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and then what happens also that you have to understand when people do these dumps there's all sorts of people that get their positions liquidated or have their stop-loss sets um like let's say a person will come in here they'll buy it or they'll set their stop-loss to fire off at i don't know sixteen thousand dollars seventeen thousand dollars when they when their profit is where they want to be at okay that that's as much like if they see a dip like this they want to automatically sell so what's going to happen is when something like this happens the wheel dumps it causes this massive sell-off but this is what it's going to look like in my opinion now is this guaranteed what's gonna happen no but i guarantee this is also what everybody else is looking for everybody who's in crypto right now that knows what they're doing they're looking for this huge bump right here you're not gonna see many people that are really in the bitcoin right now dumping when this is going on you're gonna see them dumping when this happens,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and so what you need to do is when this happens this is when you're going to see everybody going nuts saying it's a sure thing it's it's the most most magical thing ever this is what the crash is going to look like okay and you can see it popped up again right here but then you have to understand the crash also doesn't go down all at once too what it's then going to do is going to bounce around and do this and then it's kind of goes down and then it goes down so it almost took about two months from its peak for it to really die so it's very unlikely unless there's something crazy that happens we're going to see bitcoin go from where it is to just stupid lows and that's what i was paranoid for at first when i first got into it and it caused me to be a lot more nervous uh with holding bitcoin just being straight up with you what i'm looking for is when bitcoin does this okay and then what i plan to do is as soon as this happens you start dollar cost averaging out,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
#NAME?,okay or you could be uh you could be a wild person do this but only about one percent of people got out right here in the bull run so more than likely you need to you need to guesstimate you're probably going to be getting out of like an average like this if you time it perfectly around this range,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and so this is how you kind of need to be looking at it because this is as long as these these 4 30 40 dips happen people aren't going to be in enough profit to trigger this amount of sell-off and they're probably just not going to this is this is what people are looking for so understand now here's what you also have to understand look at where the peak of bitcoin was if you're in the market right now you've probably noticed that ethereum uh falls a lot more a lot more than bitcoin does when bitcoin crashes and so you probably think that when bitcoin crashes then it's time for you to sell your theorem obviously that's what the market's doing the reason why i think ethereum also dips a lot harder is because you have a lot more retail investors in ethereum right now bitcoin in the marketplace right now has a lot of big money in it that isn't that isn't going to get shooken out unless they're trying to shake other people out but look at the peak right here all right december uh,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,16th right now look at the peak of ethereum last bull run january 12th so it took almost a full month and look where this like right here ethereum wasn't even doing its crazy thing yet when bitcoin had crashed okay so this is about where this is about where bitcoin uh finally started its descent at ethereum during this time frame doubled so this is another thing you need to know when crypto crashes the last thing you want to be doing is exiting all your ethereum positions and panic and that's exactly what i did as well so bitcoin crash and ethereum started crashing most cryptos that i know when bitcoin starts crashing even if it's the end of the bull run they don't really care because they're waiting for this to happen and so why does this happen well it's pretty simple you just have to understand what people are doing behind the scenes when this happens right here people are going to sell their bitcoin they're going to get bored of it they're going to take all their profits that they made right here and then they're going to dump it into the next thing,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and then what's going to happen again is if we go and look at the peaks of other coins for example altcoins i'm not going to go through all those charts but as soon as the theorem did this then all the arc the alt coins went nuts let's go look at a common one like like chain link for example so this is why people get really excited start to get really pumped up when they see bitcoin go down so you can see if you got into chain link in 2017 about when bitcoin was going to its top no one was really interested in chain link and they went from you know 17 cents all the way up to 1.45 around the same time frame as ethereum so this is just general info you need to know about what it crashes probably going to look like is this bitcoin is going to do this gradual thing for probably the rest of the year again this is not financial advice in any way shape or form this is this is this is my prediction it's going to do this thing for the rest of you it's going to go like this,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
#NAME?,and then we're going to see this happen again and there's going to be too many people in profit and the whales who have gotten in are going to be in so much profit and it's going to be they're going to see this and and you have to understand people keep screaming diamond hands hold forever all this kind of stuff look if you were a billionaire who just got in at 30 000 and it's at 250 000 and you know how trading works you have no reason not to take profits here and then just buy it back up here even if you plan on holding bitcoin because you know if you sell you're going to trigger the market to go down anyways okay and if you think billionaires on the people that hold lots of the bitcoin are not talking to each other you're insane okay so you have to understand that like this the big money doesn't have super hard diamond hands yeah there will be people that hold no matter what but people are going to take profit and it's going to get up here people are getting into way too high of profit,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,and it's going to dip and then we're going to see ethereum do this and we're probably going to see all the altcoins go absolutely insane and so that's that's what it's probably going to look like and then when those start to go down and you do that so what what can you do with this how can how can you structure this one i don't really i don't really buy bitcoin i'll buy all my bitcoin back when it's down here okay what i what i think my logical way to do it is to wait for bitcoin to do this and that's going to really signal to you when the when it's time to get into all coins and as soon as these all coins all start going nuts exit the alt coins buy bitcoin that's that's the smart move in my opinion right there and then put put bitcoin in block fi and then hold it for the next uh the next round that's coming but if you don't understand what's gonna happen right here you're going to buy bitcoin right here you're going to hold bitcoin right here,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
#NAME?,and then you're going to you're going to freak out and panic sell and then you're going to sell all your altcoins and all your ethereum when it's like right here before it goes off and you're just going to get wrecked and so you're probably thinking you know what's the safe bet in this situation well there's two things you can do first off invest in thick pikachu's okay look look at the price they've been skyrocketing this is obviously the best thing you can buy to hold money ever just a hand i hold two tick pikachus if you buy them i'll probably flip them on you and by far the best investment you can make in this marketplace for example look at this person who bought the last pin comment on my last video he bought it for uh 18 cents it can now go for 300 that's like a zillion percent roi,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
#NAME?,so you can just ignore these charts right here or you could do something really crazy and invest in one of my fine fine art pieces right here uh red square number three is actually an auction for 106 right now and it originally sold for 12 cents uh this is a very fine piece of art and if you're thinking how do i buy some of this legitimate art from yonks well you know as soon as this video is done i'm going to be minting this video and you can buy the pinned first comment with your name and link to your website in it and then you can show it to all your friends and be like look how woke and successful i am owning this sweet red square and this this guy who screams at people on the internet's uh first comment you'll really like it so that being said guys i want to get this out,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

VYKXrL-rSOs, folks war is coming January saw a collapse in U.S Equity allocation amongst Global fund managers in the latest B of A survey we need to discuss what and why this is happening and what that tells us moving forward number two we need to discuss the truth about where fund managers are actually allocating their money and why that is we'll show the data and the receipts and finally number three the global Elite praise be upon their Holiness are meeting at Davos for the world economic forum and it's already getting hairy what should you know time stamps down below and we'll get right to work after a quick plug today's video is brought to you by our MLK Junior 50 off sale on zip Trader U which expires at midnight tonight type in coupon code mlk50 before checkout and get 50 off the one-time fee again this coupon code expires at midnight tonight so make sure to give it a look as soon as possible the one-time fee gets you unlimited access to our step-by-step lessons private chat popular daily morning briefings and others resources that you can learn more about with that link down below okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VYKXrL-rSOs,so fund managers are now the most underweight Securities that they've been since October of 2005. but why is that Charlie well when asked what the biggest tail risks are the number one answer is still inflation stays High although votes for that dropped a bit over December deep Global recession was number two Central Bank staying hawkish number three geopolitics worsening also increased and then you had a systemic credit event and coveted Resurgence at the bottom of the list so despite the progress on the CPI in the late 2023 fed pivot being priced into Bond markets while fund managers aren't really feeling that much better about the main tail risks although when asked whether they are expecting a stronger economy in the next 12 months you did actually see that turn around a bit it's still deeply negative don't get me wrong which means more people expect a weak economy than expect a strong one but it has turned around a bit we are almost approaching those lows that we had in the troughs of March 22 20.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VYKXrL-rSOs,so what is spurring this light turnaround here well if you are in the boat that the FED is going to start stimulating in Q3 or Q4 you will also be more inclined to believe that we will have a stronger economy by then as well right and that's what you're starting to see these participants acknowledge and one of the things that you haven't had yet is a narrative shift in order to move on to a new market narrative you need to see the biggest tail risk transform into something else before this you have the cough cough crisis and then sense essentially March of 2021 you've had the Central Bank inflation scare with a few divergences but mostly focused on Central Bank and inflation right so if you really want to see a broader shift in trading you need to see the major underlying worry shift as well and we just haven't gone there,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VYKXrL-rSOs,yet what's the next big tail risk Quarry well likely Global recession once that happens markets will stop caring about inflation and hawkish central banks but Charlie the FED won't cut rates until inflation is at two percent while I strongly disagree with that the FED will cut rates the minute a massive recession causes unemployment to start skyrocketing does it matter if inflation is at three percent or four percent or even five percent they'll say this is the better of two evils we must cut cut in order to save jobs and help support the economy and that's what you are seeing the bond markets pricing as well right if you look at the percentage of fund managers surveyed expecting lower versus higher bond yields in 12 months they've hit a convergence point where as of right now slightly more managers think rates will be lower in 12 months versus higher in 12 months and the trend is pretty clearly upward so the majority of managers no longer trust the fed's narrative that they'll keep rates high for the next several years that's a big shift and if this trend upward continues you're going to start seeing that impact the market as well but what is the big money doing how are fund managers allocating their portfolios well in terms of positioning changes you have a lot of fund managers adding to positions and utilities which have pricing power in both Bull and Bear markets and pay big dividends add back into the Eurozone which is improving value-wise as compared to the immediate aftermath of the invasion and adding into emerging markets at a pretty big Pace as they expect them to bounce back with the weakening of the US dollar and reopened China pouring into Industrials pouring into discretion area which are companies like retailers hotels restaurants overall Leisure my guess is probably because they are discounted I would think that discretionary wouldn't be the top bet when entering a recession but they seem not to care I think they're trying to scoop up those dips and get some good diversification you have them going back into the UK Market insurance and Banks and then look at what they are reducing their positioning in Commodities and energy as they see down Trends in price Consumer Staples as Supply chains heal and there's less profitability and price gouging over the excess input cost bonds as they get destroyed with higher yields tech stocks as multiples continue to get crunched Health Care they are positioning out of probably taking profit because the healthcare segment was one of the best performers year over year one of the only segments size energy that was green almost across the board and then you have a reduction in equities and a massive massive reduction in positioning in the U.S market,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VYKXrL-rSOs,so why would the global fund managers completely obliterate their positions in U.S markets well because in 2022 the U.S market was considered the closest thing to a safe haven as Ukraine saw the invasion and the rest of Europe went into an economic crisis with spiraling Energy prices and the strong U.S dollar destroyed a lot of the Emerging Markets so fund managers sold Europe and emerging markets and poured into U.S assets U.S equities U.S cash so on and so forth and right now you are seeing a reversal of that with capital flowing back into the Eurozone and emerging markets and out of the U.S on top of that the Federal Reserve has essentially declared war on the U.S economy making it even more toxic for funds to hold U.S assets right unless you're talking about USD but of course the USD is starting to sell off as well because they think the fed's going to Pivot so you kind of have the worst of Both Worlds and this is actually pretty historic this is the biggest wind of U.S exposure since October 2005 and it shows no signs of slowing next let's go ahead and move over to the holy Elites at Dava so the world economic Forum the lovely wef is holding their annual Davos meeting this week from the 16th to the 20th and the wef gets a lot of criticism because it comes across as this meeting or the global know-it-all Elites prescribed their cures for what they see as wrong with Humanity for example as you probably know the whole great reset conversation stems from the wef's great reset initiative which said that we should just use the pandemic to focus on a reset a wonderful reset,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VYKXrL-rSOs,yes yes yes that governments and Powerful corporations can work together to force on the little guy and unlike the democratically elected bodies that at least try to act like they give the little guy a voice well the wef has really only the unelected elites and maybe at best a few democratically elected leaders depending on the year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VYKXrL-rSOs,but they aren't the ones setting the narrative most of the time and to be fair folks look the wef isn't technically a governing body itself but it is sort of a pseudo one that applies social and virtue signaling pressure to the many Business Leaders who attend it and because the attendees have a lot of combined wealth and power you can see how everyday people like you are high might be suspicious more than 600 CEOs will be in town including Wall Street Executives such as JP Morgan's Jamie dimon David Solomon from the sacks of Goldman and Morgan Stanley's James Gorman nearly one of four attendees are CEOs with some other big names like the leadership of shell Amazon City Group moderna and BlackRock you have some big universities like Stanford also attending and of course most of the media so in totality you have big Bank CEOs Tech leaders media oil and University professors all coming together to come up with how they believe the world should be shaped and how that can be forced to be implemented on the populace at least when Marie Antoinette had her ideas she let us eat cake but these people would say no cake because that's bad for the environment only we get to eat cake here at the top to me this meeting always comes across as very pompous and arrogant but fine,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

VYKXrL-rSOs,but nonetheless we are going to find out real soon what the Davos Elite prescribed for the coming years and what the new theme of conversation is going to be for 2023 what is the next stage of this great reset that is going to completely remake the world in their image we'll keep you updated make sure to let us know your thoughts down below and today's video is brought to you by our ZIP Trader you program link down below which includes our step-by-step lessons private chat and our very popular daily morning briefings some of the best briefing ideas we identified the last few weeks include HKD which was a 309 run briefing price to highs Triple B Y another massive run party Jasper antf blph and of course the lovely Cola now these are some of the best plays we've had the last few weeks and certainly not all of our briefing ideas run that's not the point of them the goal is to make our members aware of catalysts and Trends before the rest of the market is a crucial part of success in this Mark Market is timely research and drowning out the noise and that's the goal of the briefings and we do that to the best of our ability and if you'd like to join us right now you are in luck in honor of MLK,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

dvZ1mkBc79E, folks the big banks are in trouble and I think this might be the most important video that I have ever posted on YouTube the system is starting to collapse in front of our eyes and even the FED is starting to admit it in this video we are going to break down exactly what you need to know and I promise if you watch to the very end you are going to be very very happy you did because I'm going to give you an entirely New Perspective on this financial sector and really the banking system that we have and the threats that it is facing right now and this video is brought to you by our flash 40 coupon code on our ZIP Trader you program link down below the coupon code expires at midnight so this is the last opportunity to give that 40 off before checkout we have been warning about this for over a week now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

dvZ1mkBc79E,and then they go and lend it out to other people for purchases of homes or whatever most people also think that reserve requirements are very very high so as to prevent Bank collapses or Bank runs and people not being able to withdraw money right well neither of these things are completely true in fact the FED sets reserve requirements and on March 15 2020 the FED board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent zero percent and that has been effective since March 26 2020.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,this action completely eliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions prior to this regulations in the U.S forced banks with over 122 million in assets which is pretty much any sizable Bank to hold at least 10 percent of their deposits in their reserves so what actually happens now in the post-pandemic world is Banks just choose whatever rate they feel is adequate for reserves and then they Shore it up if they think things are getting a little sketchy like they're doing right now at the last minute and net and in effect you just kind of have to hope that the banks know what they're doing but let's just say that banks are all operating as responsible entities and they're choosing to operate on a self-imposed 10 percent reserve requirement to ensure that they are well fortified well what happens then how does the banking system work then well once your 100 000 goes into the bank they go and they put 10 000 of that in their reserves,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,and then they go and lend out the remaining ninety thousand Jill schmoe comes to the bank and says hey I want a ninety thousand dollar loan the bank goes and lends Joe Schmo the ninety thousand Joe Schmo puts it in his own bank account at let's just say another institution that bank now has ninety thousand dollars and Joe schmoe has a ninety thousand dollar balance in his savings account so what does the bank do with that ninety thousand dollars that they're now storing for Joe schmoe well they take 10 as well as a reserve and then they prepare the remainder for Lending themselves then Jill Smith comes along and just for Simplicity let's just say that she happens to want exactly eighty one thousand dollars the bank loans her the 81 000,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,and then she goes and puts it in her own bank account at you guessed it another institution who then lends it out again now where am I going with this well let's just look at how much the money supply has already expanded the original deposit of a hundred thousand dollars in your bank account has now also resulted in ninety thousand in Joe schmo's bank account and 81 000 in Jill's bank account technically your one hundred thousand dollar deposit has now expanded the money supply to a total of two hundred seventy one thousand dollars the banks owe a total of two hundred seventy one thousand dollars in deposits to deposites all originating from that one hundred thousand dollar original deposit now let's make this a little bit more complicated and a little bit more realistic let's say that the bank that Jill deposited money into goes and takes the eighty one thousand dollars and saves the ten percent reserves and uses the remaining 172 900 dollars to lend out but the bank lends it out via credit cards to 10 different people who just separately spent seventy two hundred ninety dollars each well now they've each gone and borrowed seventy two hundred ninety bucks and they've gone and spent it at a bunch of different businesses who then do what with the money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,well they go and they store it in their own accounts they use some of that to pay employees to buy materials pay all expenses and so on and so forth and that money goes and gets deposited in the accounts of the people that they are making those payments to and so on and so forth those people go and buy things and those people go and buy things and those people go and buy things and the bank goes and ones out their money and their money and their money who then more people go and use the buy things and put in their accounts and so on and so forth so you could see just that starting point where you're giving the bank a hundred thousand dollars how far that goes down the road in terms of increasing the total money supply in the economy it's a situation where dollars just keep expanding and expanding until one thing breaks and all of a sudden everything must come cascading in like dominoes and obviously the lower the interest rates and they'll lower the reserve requirements the more this phenomenon is allowed to happen so if the FED wants to stop it from happening and start restricting it and slow down the economy they can go and do the reverse of this which is what they're doing but in doing so the FED recognizes the system that is in place and how sensitive it is because while they are raising rates while they are quantitative tightening while they are trying to drain liquidity from the overall Financial system they also have to understand that if they go too far and too aggressively while the entire house of cards could just collapse very very easily so let's just suppose for a second that just one of these institutions sees some sort of problem where people are trying to withdraw too much Capital some loan segments are defaulting at too high of a rate and the bank needs to all of a sudden eat up their reserves well the bank now owes a lot of money to people and businesses who store their cash at that bank but the bank doesn't have the money to give them which means that basically the entire chain of the financial system is now screwed so in order to reduce the risk of this happening when banks no longer have reserves well there's the institution of the Federal Reserve the bank would then go and if it meets the requirements the FED could go and provide some excess liquidity to that bank to get it through the bank run so what happens when banks in the U.S can't go and pay out their depositors they don't have the immediate liquidity,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,well they go up and call the Federal Reserve pop a Powell answers and they say Daddy Powell we need liquidity as fast as possible we need it now we need to pay out people this is a huge threat to the entire Financial system and Papa Powell says okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,turning the money printers on and they provide that excess liquidity and the U.S Central Bank does this not just in the U.S but really around the world which we'll talk a little bit more about later because that's happening at an unprecedented rate now if a U.S Bank is so destabilized that it can't be provided liquidity from the FED because there's no hopes of it paying it back well then the bank has to go to the taxpayers first they hit the FDIC and the vastly underfunded fractional Reserve FDIC program goes and looks at how to bail them out or you have to go down some other avenues where the taxpayer cuts the check but from the person perspective of the government and from the Central Bank you don't want any of the financial system members to get anywhere close to needing you for that excess liquidity and definitely not needing you for a bailout because at that point the House of Cards is only about an action or two a misplaced action or two from completely tumbling because even though this sounds like a very very crazy system and is very very delicate while the original one hundred thousand dollar deposit itself was just one hundred thousand pieces of fugazi paper and nowadays fugazi digits that don't have any inherent value outside of the Full Faith and Credit of the US government so in a system where you are printing fugazi pieces of paper and that fugazi piece of paper is being re-borrowed millions of time and circulated throughout the economy like all,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

dvZ1mkBc79E,hey wait maybe we need to make sure this house of cards stays up because it's going to be very very difficult to deal with the ramifications if it doesn't so the point is if you understand this fractional Reserve banking system you understand exactly that the FED can only do so much so fast when it comes down to this policy trajectory they are on and if you listen to them very very carefully you can see that anxiety over the collapse of this entire system is starting to grow and what are some new threats that we're seeing right now well let's start with the treasury market watch just reported quote for months Traders academics and other analysts have read it that the 23.7 trillion dollar treasury market might be the source of the next financial crisis then last week U.S Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged concerns about a potential breakdown in the trading of government debt and expressed worry about a loss of adequate liquidity a loss of adequate liquidity in the market hmm now strategists at B of A Securities have identified a list of reasons why U.S government bonds are exposed to the risk of large-scale forced selling or an external surprise at a time when the bond market is in need of reliable groups of big buyers what about the confidence to pay public debt in the first place well Peter Schiff who yes is an eternal Bearer and big gold guy and has been for decades he raised a good point on Twitter today he said when the national debt hits 35 trillion next year at a six percent interest rate annual interest payments on the national debt would exceed National Defense welfare and education spending combined at eight percent interest would exceed Social Security National Defense and education combined so here you're looking at this and you've got to be thinking two things either we go and we print tons more money to be able to deal with this massive deficit that we're going to have or we go back and we lower rates again and to be fair when rates rise it's not like all government debt now has to pay the higher interest rate immediately no a lot of it is locked in 10 20 or 30-year fixed payments but the point is the more restrictive you go and for longer the worse the debt repayment situation is and the higher interest rates climb the farther you go the worse of the situation it is and the closer you get to something like this which he's talking about and of course one of the more troubling areas that the FED is acting very very quickly to try to solve is in the international liquidity Market the FED seems very very worried about the international U.S led Financial system in fact the Swiss National Bank this week Drew more than 11 billion dollars from the U.S federal reserves currency swap line facility another sharp rise from the week earlier amount New York fed data released on Thursday showed the Swiss National Bank had drawn nearly 6.3 billion the week before and 3.1 billion the week before that look at how fast this is exploding and a lot of people say oh this is all,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,Credit Suisse but I think it's a lot of other Banks as well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,yes and B the Swiss National Bank referred to its auction results showing 17 parties had participated in its dollar auction this week and declined for their comment this means what a lot of Swiss banks and really European Banks if you look at everything including the European Central Bank and what they're going through right now while a lot of them are needing access to emergency reserves of liquidity denominated in USD they simply don't have enough so they are rushing to the U.S Central Bank and the U.S Central Bank hoping to prevent a global collapse is providing them liquidity as fast as they possibly can this is happening to a degree all over the world right now and it is just starting and because of these measures the FED is starting to get a lot of accusations that they're actually doing some contradictory measures providing liquidity is a form of quantitative easing is it not you're providing money into the system and listen to what some fed members are saying this is feds Mary Daly from San Francisco unusual whales reported this morning that she said quote interventions to stabilize a dislocated Market is very different from quantitative easing interesting interesting so the FED is trying to intervene into dislocated destabilized markets by injecting liquidity and that is supposed to be different than quantitative easing is it though is that different when the fed's goal right now is to take away as much liquidity of USD as possible is it not contradictory to then go and re-inject liquidity in certain areas does that not represent certain areas where the FED is already starting to push back on its own policy because they're fearing the overall Financial system may be maybe in dire risk of collapse if they don't does this symbolize that a broader fed pivot may very well be close by so what are some triggers that the Federal Reserve responds to when considering whether or not they need to provide more quantitative easing or more injections of liquidity or a overall fed pivot well luckily they post these vulnerabilities for everybody to see I'm going to read over the list that they have on their website very quickly and I want you to ask yourself as I'm reading over this if you see any of these as high risk areas in The Current financial system and the current economy on both a national level or on a global level number one the first vulnerability they say is elevated valuation pressures as signaled by asset prices that are high relative to economic fundamentals or historical Norms this is a vulnerability in the sense that it implies a greater possibility of outsized drops in asset prices that destabilizes the whole system all at once number two excessive borrowing by businesses and households which leaves them to distress if their incomes decline or the assets they own fall in value ask yourself are businesses or households at risk of seeing assets they hold decline in value or their income decline within the next 12 months is that a risk number three excessive leverage within the financial system is there excessive leverage right now even with rates going up well this is a chart of the millions of dollars in margin Accounts at Brokers and dealers is this too high compared to where we were pre-pandemic obviously a lot of people are like well it's come down a little bit but is it more or less risky than it was just in 2019 or 2018.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,ask yourself that question and finally number four elevated funding risks elevated funding risks can occur when financial institutions raise funds from the public with a commitment to return investor money on short notice but those institutions then invest much of the funds and illiquid assets that are hard to sell quickly or in assets that have a long maturity ask yourself right now are you starting to see crucial debt markets freeze up and provide very very little liquidity on both a individual institution basis or on a governmental basis or on a global basis are you seeing any evidence of a liquidity in bond markets so the question that I have for you in conclusion is are the risks that I just mentioned are they already at elevated levels are they already showing outsized when comparing to previous decades outsized risk and more importantly are they going to get worse into 2023 if yes then that means the FED has two options as we go into q1 and Q2 of 2023.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
dvZ1mkBc79E,the first option is fight inflation and risk the entire house of cards collapsing in a very tragic insane fireworky type of way or number two pivot and just let the currency inflate at extreme rates for as long as necessary based on reports that I'm seeing it seems like somewhere in the middle of those two I think that you have enough hawkish members at the FED that are going to be willing to push this farther but but I also think the FED is going to settle on a inflationary Target rate that is well above two percent anyways that caps off the video make sure to take advantage of that flash 40 coupon code which expires tonight at midnight and we will see you in the next video oh yeah also MooMoo 15 free stocks if you want to get up to 15 free stocks with our link down below we'll also put a link to them excellent trading platform and broker I think you're gonna like them a lot have a good one folks and have a great week and we'll see you on Sunday,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
mJdwwOjf6LI,"hi folks David Waring here again with informed trades dot-com in today's lesson of the day in our last lesson we looked at how an individual's need to be part of a group with a strong leader can be detrimental to one's trading success in today's lesson we're going to switch gears away from the psychology of trading with a look at how to set realistic profit expectations the first step to building a successful money management strategy the key component to any successful trading strategy is setting realistic profit expectations all too often I see traders with account balances of $10,000 or less who are expecting to make a living off of their trading profits within a very short period of time now while this is not surprising considering all of the hype that's out there and associated with most trading education and signal services etc that are out there it unfortunately does not make that a realistic goal as most successful traders will tell you the u.s. stock market which has been the best performing asset class over the last 100 years has averaged about 10% a year over that time period so what this means is that if you would have invested in 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the over the last hundred years you would have averaged about 10 percent and you would have beaten any other asset class that you could have invested in on average over that time period um what those same traders will also tell you is with that in mind if you can double that return as a trader you're going to be considered among the top traders out there so does this mean that if you're new to trading with a small account balance that you can't eventually earn a living or even become rich from trading",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
mJdwwOjf6LI,no it does not but what it does mean is that your expectations need to be in line with reality so you can develop a long term plan that will lead to success instead of following the path of most small traders who swing for the fences on every trade and eventually blow their account up okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
mJdwwOjf6LI,"so with this in mind let's look at a couple scenarios what most successful traders will also tell you is that as a small trader you have much more flexibility regarding what you can put money into as your small trade size and is an advantage in the sense that you don't move the market or catch the attention of other traders you may try and profit off of what you're doing it's your expense with this in mind I think most successful traders wouldn't argue with 30% as a reasonable target for profits for the year while you're small now assuming you left your profits in your trading account at the end of each year so that you could compound your returns and average 30% a year obviously with some years being better in some years being worse your returns on a account balance of $10,000 or an initial account balance of $10,000 over 20 years would look like the following now depending on where you live and where your what your financial requirements to live are you may be satisfied with this if you are not however does this mean that you're doomed to never live your dream of being a professional trader",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
mJdwwOjf6LI,no it does not if you can produce those types of returns tradition consistently what most successful traders are also going to tell you is that there's going to be people lined up with your door to offer you money to trade as you're going to be beating the markets handily most years and you wouldn't have to produce these types of returns for more than a couple of years in a row before that would happen and you could raise even in the several millions of dollars a type of money to trade so most successful money managers charge a management and performance fee which is somewhere in the neighborhood of two and twenty which is 2% of assets under management yearly and 20% of net new profits as their compensation for managing other people's money with this in mind if you're able to produce a track record similar to the one we just listed for two to three years running,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
mJdwwOjf6LI,and then we're able to raise five million dollars which shouldn't be that hard considering you know the type of returns you've just generated then your yearly management fee would look in your compensation scheme would look like following your five million times your 30% profit will be 1.5 million in profit for the fund 2% management fee so 2 percent of the 5 million will be a hundred thousand 20 percent of the 1.5 million would be three hundred thousand so your total compensation for the year there would be four hundred and fifty thousand so if you think about it it's it's a much more intelligent or a much more intelligent way to become a successful and very profitable trader you can make a very good living and actually become rich trading if you have a small account is to develop a profitable track record by not swinging for the fences but by practicing sound money management principles and developing a good track record that people are going to want to put money behind and then raising up money and you're going to be able to make a substantial amount more most likely then you're going to make swing for the fences where you're most likely going to blow your accounts up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
mJdwwOjf6LI,okay the purpose of the inform trades dot-com community is to hopefully build a community of traders you want to come together and learn together without all the hype that's associated with most trading education so if you haven't done so already I encourage you not only to visit the informed trades comm site but every page on the site has a comment section so I encourage you to actively leave your questions and then share your knowledge where appropriate okay so that's our lesson for today in tomorrow's lesson we're going to look at several different ways of protecting one's capital while trading so we hope to see in that lesson as always if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them in the comment section below and have a great day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE," - Hey it's Clay Trader at ClayTrader.com. In this video, I want to talk about options and options are great because they solve a massive problem that many traders come across and I'm all about finding solutions to problems and options are exactly that, a solution to an issue and problem that many traders face. So let me just kinda illustrate what's going on here. First we just have, you know, bunch of little people up here. This represents just traders. Traders in general. And as traders in general, you know we're always looking to find well, we think stocks are gonna go up or we think stocks might go down. So let's say you're looking at a stock that cost 200 dollars and you're saying you know, I think that stock's gonna go up. However you're also thinking, well the only way I can make money on that is if I what? The traditional way, if you buy shares. But what's the problem here that many traders have? Well it's 200 dollars a share. Unless you have a massive account, being able to purchase enough shares to make it worth your time becomes very very difficult.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE,"Now sure maybe one of these traders up here is able to do that, to go the traditional route of buying shares and get involved in the trade. But there's nothing worse than seeing that your idea was right, that 200 dollar stock did indeed fall, and that money could've been made. Pretty frustrating, almost a feeling of helplessness, your hands are cuffed, your accounts just not quite big enough in order to get down here. But this is where options come into play and why options are very very beneficial. If only there was a way to kind of pull a maneuver like that and there is. And they're called options. Options are a way to bypass this step and let you still get involved. So key word here, get involved. With options, you can get involved with essentially anything in the market. Doesn't matter the share price because the way options function, they're gonna allow you to get involved, skip over the traditional step of having to buy shares, and they're still gonna allow you to make money off of the play. Remember you recognize that this 200 dollar stock, you thought you know what?",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE,"For whatever reason you're using, whatever strategy, or whatever your methodology was of determining you know what I think this 200 dollar stock is gonna go up, you were right. But the only thing that was holding you back was your account size just isn't enough to buy shares. But you were right and that's the important part. And because you were right, now with options, you could've still made money from it. You could've got involved with it. And that is the power of options, that is how options function. So what I wanna do is talk about three real trades that I participated in and that way it can give you an example of how exactly options work relative to the actual stock. Now before I get into the three actual examples, I wanna point out that you're gonna notice that the stock price in each example actually goes down in price. However I've done this for a very specific reason, to show that no matter whether the stock price goes up or down, options will still allow you to make money. So a very powerful thing as it affords you just massive flexibility.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE,"Stock price goes up, great you can make money. Stock price goes down, great, with options the way they function, you can still make money. So for the first example, I noticed this chart and it was currently trading right around the area of 119.50. And at that time I thought you know what? I think the price is gonna go down. So what I then did was went and I bought options for two dollars and three cents. Now as it turned out, the chart led me to a proper conclusion and the stock did fall down in price, in fact it fell as far as 117.46. And this was a percentage of one point seven percent on the decline and now in order to get involved, remember, that's what options are allowing us to get involved with. I would've needed what 119 dollars and 50 cents. The minimum needed, I could've bought one share. However think about that. Making one point seven percent on 119 dollars and 50 cents and then you have all those commissions, I mean, it makes sense.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE,"That's just not a very rational, not a very logical thing to do because the commissions are gonna eat away at everything. However, let's look at the options. By the time everything was said and done, the options had gone as high as three dollars and 55 cents. And that was a gain of 75 percent. So hopefully you're starting to see the difference now. And to get involved, what was the minimum you needed to get involved? 203 dollars. Sure a little bit more than here, but what is that a difference of about 80 some dollars? So for 80 dollars more to get involved, (chalk tapping) you could've had an opportunity at 75 percent gain on 203 dollars. Not too bad. Again look at it like this, making one point seven percent on 119 dollars and 50 cents, or making 75 percent on 203 dollars. You know think about that. Options, very powerful and all you needed was 203 dollars in your account. I really wanna drive that home because that really shows how options function.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE,"For our second example, once again I found a stock and I thought you know what, that chart looks like it wants to go down in price. So at the time when I saw it, the stock itself was trading for 146.80. So because I thought you know what, I think that's gonna go down and I went and bought some options. And for these I paid two dollars and 80 cents for the option. Now by the time everything was said and done, once again the chart led me and was right, the price did indeed fall. The stock had fallen all the way to 137.60. And a little side note with this one, I actually alerted it to our chatroom, so you know it kind of, other people had the opportunity at it, so this was an actual chat room alert too that I issued, but it dropped down to 137.60 so that was a decrease of six point three percent on the fall. Now how much money would you have needed to get involved? Again if you're just buying one share, you would've needed 146 dollars and 80 cents.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE,"So you know making six point three percent on 146.80, you know maybe you'd finally be able to cover your commissions depending on your broker, maybe just maybe you would've broken even. So again, not very ideal. However, let's look at the options. So by the time everything was said and done with the options, those had gone as high as seven dollars and 30 cents. So looking at things from a percentage standpoint here, that was 161 percent move. And again the money needed to get involved, 280 dollars. So sure a little bit more than that, but let's see, make six point three percent on 146 or make 161 percent on 280, I think that's pretty impressive and also keep in mind that these were all day trades. Meaning it happened in the same day. 75 percent in one day. 161 percent in one day. Actually it was really just a few hours, but for argument's sake here, just know that this was all happening in one day. But now that leads to the question of well, I can't sit there and day trade stock so I'm not gonna be able to day trade options either. Fair enough.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE,"It works for swing trading too and that's where we're leading for our third example. So again, I noticed this chart and I thought hey, that price looks like it wants to fall. So at that time the stock was trading for 115.75. So because I thought the price would fall, I went and bought some options. And for these options, I paid 63 cents. Now by the time all was said and done, the chart had once again had led me to a profitable decision in thinking you know what it looks like the price is gonna fall. It did fall and the stock itself fell down as low as 112.78. So this downwards move for the stock was two point five seven percent and again to be the minimum money to get involved, if we're just buying one share, was 115 dollars and 75 cents. Let's take a look at the options. Now this was a one night hold. So I bought one day and then you know another day passed.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE,"And the next day, so a swing trade, we're not looking to buy and sell within the same day, the next day, the option had actually gone up as high as a dollar 76. So this led to an overnight swing trade presenting an opportunity window of 179 percent. Now the money to get involved here, 63 dollars. If you don't have 63 dollars in your trading account, you probably shouldn't be trading. So again in this case, it actually cost less, but yet you had 179 percent versus two point five seven percent. So keep all this in mind, you know this is how options work. Doesn't really matter anymore. And it doesn't matter at all really in terms of the price of the stock because with options, you're gonna get involved. Now of course options, if you are a gambler and don't have a strategy, don't have a plan, can be very risky, there's no doubt about that at all. So just wanna give that up front. But it's very real, it's very possible to make good sized gains.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
NYJgS9UpudE,"I'm not saying you're gonna make 100 percent every time or anything like that, but just understand that options not only allow you to get involved, but they can present some very nice opportunities. I hope you enjoyed this video but more importantly I hope it's at least opened your eyes to seeing just how options can help you get involved no matter what. There's gonna be no more of this you've seen a stock that's trading for 350 dollars and you're thinking you know what I think that stock's gonna go down in price but then having to sit on the sideline because you can't get involved. Now with options you can get involved and that's where the true power is. It's not necessarily in the gains, while those are certainly nice, but it's nice because it allows you to get involved in anything. Remember, down here, all it took was 63 dollars to get involved into a stock that was trading for over 150 so think about that. What does it take to get involved? Not very much, and that's a very powerful thing and it really opens up your horizons.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

It goes over everything necessary to understand options, understand what ones pertain to different situations. But after the course, you're gonna be able to sit there and say you know what? I think this stock is gonna do this and then you're gonna be able to transition into the options and know what to do. So as long as you have a viable strategy, a viable formula to think you know what, I think that stock price is gonna go up or down, then options is something that should learn because options will allow you to get involved in your profitable decision. Nothing worse than sitting there saying, yeah, that stock is gonna go up and then you see it go up and have to say well too bad I couldn't get involved.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

ZuGdtdsyxGA, hello traders we're excited to continue bringing you live automated trading so anyone interested can watch this next-generation technology as it's being deployed we're getting a ton of questions on the strategies that you're seen the strategies are all developed using existing trade ideas alerts and filters the way we come up with strategies is through a rigorous process of back testing and forward testing we take a look at what produces the best results and try to find the type of strategy that can translate well from back test to live trading many people simply ask us if they could buy or have the strategies that we're showing and we always reply the same way we do not sell the strategies that you see as a traitor what you want to do is to be able to create these strategies yourself using trade-ideas Pro and the odds maker if you can learn how to do it and it's not difficult you will have the capability of creating systems to trade in any market one thing that we know for certain,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZuGdtdsyxGA,is that the market will change and when it does we'll simply adjust the existing strategies or add new strategies that are able to cope as you watch the robot trading you notice that it's unemotionally entering and exiting positions this is the part that really helps us take advantage of the moves that we're looking to capture we know it'd be very difficult for us to try to send out so many orders to buy and short early in the morning so doing it robotically is virtually the only way the fact that our computer is always instructed to make sure that we do not lose too much money in any one trade is the other critical component simply we know ahead of time that we may be in a situation where the market doesn't turn out the way we hope but there will not be any one trade that hurts us too much that part of the game is probably the most important as you can see from watching the pl we also know that sometimes there will be draw downs and that's a normal part of trading this style the real key is to be hands-off and let the automation do what it does many people watching have been asking us what does it take to get set up the answer is simple you need an active subscription to trade ideas and you need to have the odds maker enabled on your account the oddsmakers a one-time fee of eleven hundred dollars unless you're a TD Ameritrade customer where you have a special rate in addition to the trade ideas tools described earlier you will also need to have an account at either TD Ameritrade ascent LLC interactive brokerage or mb trading,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
ZuGdtdsyxGA,I'm going to speed up the remainder of this video so that we can watch in fast motion the blotter action of this trading day you today we're operating in a gray box fashion we're automatically placing orders to initiate positions and automatically placing respective stop orders but today we're going to manually control our exit based on market conditions are optimized back testing results indicate that our exit should be 15 minutes after the market open depending on these market conditions will initiate our exit of long and short positions let's jump ahead to that scheduled exit both are open Long's and open shorts are positive but because the market is moving higher we're going to exit our shorts now and see if we can squeeze a little more from our long positions let's move ahead 7 minutes at which time we'll exit our long positions to summarize our trading day we pulled eight hundred and twenty-four dollars out of the market on 27 thousand shares will continue to bring you more of these videos in the coming year but for now we hope you enjoy watching the trade ideas automated stock trading robot,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
DPuQJNhwCOg, I want to address something today I want to address something today it's been on my mind and it's been the comments section a few times and it has to do with me kind of talking about some of the negatives I mean kind of addressing some of the mistakes I've made with investing and some of those kinds of things I get comments sometimes when I post a video like it did the other day about you know some a bunch of option contracts I sold off too soon and I got comments like why are you bringing up the past you need to move on that's an amateur move like this and that and and I always preach like don't don't think about the past like just move on learn from it and move on right but I bring up a lot of these things for the past I always bring up 2015 quite often right the year I got into margin training and doing so much stuff that just really no lost me massive amounts of money I talk about that right and I talk about my mistakes I always talk about them,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
DPuQJNhwCOg,and I talk about them probably more than anybody ever I don't even know if there's anybody even on my level as far as the amount of mistakes I talk about and how often I bring them up right and I get people they're like why why do you do that you know and whatnot so there's a lot of reasons but the main thing for me as someone that's an educator in the financial space all right that's someone that kind of introduces people a stock market gets people excited right I feel like it's my job to not just give a false narrative okay what is a false narrative mean that means to give a picture of a story that is not fully true right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
DPuQJNhwCOg,so for instance all right investing all right investing is everything perfect with investing does anybody out there always make the right move absolutely not there's never been a person in history of mankind who has made every single perfect investment every always find the perfect stock right if they did they would be a zillion error ray they would have all the money in the world because they would have made all the right moves they would have never lost a dime right it's unrealistic okay it's unrealistic so I like to bring up I like to bring up the negatives I'd like to bring up the things that are go wrong I almost sometimes literally and even though it's against my like financial well-being right sometimes I hope my stocks go down a little bit our hope a particular stock goes down because then they can bring that up and I can make videos about it and I think kind of show people the struggle as you go through I can show everybody that it's not perfect investing it's not just you know oh you just go up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
DPuQJNhwCOg,and you just make unlimited amounts of money and everything's perfect no it's not it's it's a lot of hard work that goes into it when people think about investing they get into something right a lot of times people are attracted by the money right you're gonna make money that's the thing that attracts people right that attracts people to investing they think they're gonna make their money into money that's awesome and and generally if you work hard enough and you got the right strategy like 99 out of 100 times you're probably will make money right what the issue is there's gonna be at least one out of a hundred times if not ten out of a hundred times then you don't make money where things don't go your way where things didn't go as planned right and the issue I have is I think I think that's when I look out into a financial space where I look out in the investment community I don't see enough of the bad stuff ever being talked about I don't see if nothing the specifics being talked about to see enough of the specific moves,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
DPuQJNhwCOg,and I think it's because a lot of times people are afraid that because they talk about a negative they talk about a mistake they made they might lose credibility in my comment to that is is you can't be afraid of that as an educator you can't be afraid of that you're doing a disservice to your community if you don't ever talk about the bad if all you talk about is the good stuff you've done and you never talk about the bad you're doing disservice to your community in my in my opinion that's just you know at the end of the day you're doing a disservice because you're given a false narrative on this story that everything is beautiful everything you just make money right and that attracts people and they think it's just an easy game and it's not an easy game everything in life is hard hey you got it you want a sacrifice you got to put in work you got to put in time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
DPuQJNhwCOg,so the things I preach all the time about investing you've got to put in the work you got to read those annual reports you got to do all this stuff right it's not just an easy game because guess what if it was such an easy game every single person would be doing it making so much freaking money okay it's not that easy you've got to have the right strategy you guys stick to that strategy and then you've got to put in the work to actually get you to that place guys so that that's why I bring up the bad stuff and that's why I love to bring it up you know I love to bring it up whenever I have a chance to because it gives it gives you you know a realistic view of what investing really is what the world really is because it's not all just profits it's not just all gains it's not just all greatness right there's some mistakes that are made,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
DPuQJNhwCOg,and I feel like that those mistakes are never talked about enough in my opinion the only thing that's ever talked about as far as mistakes is like people talk about like the financial crisis and whatnot just a general thing that's just a general thing man that's just a general thing you're talking about I want specifics I want actual stocks you made that where bad moves I want to hear about a bad option contract you bought I want to hear about you know a bad year you had why you had that bad year I want to hear about that stuff because that's gonna tell me a lot more about yourself then and then just the good stuff right we learn we learn more from from humans right you learn more from a person in their bad times then you do actually their good times right so you know that's just kind of my opinion on it and that's why I talk about the bad stuff and I will continue to talk about it if I make a mistake here or there I'll continue to talk about it not because I'm dwelling on it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
DPuQJNhwCOg,I don't ever think about it when I'm in my own time I don't never dwell on anything okay I don't never dwell on anything but on this channel I'm gonna make sure I bring up stuff when I want to bring up stuff that's negative because that's got to be talked about as well guys so anyways hope you enjoyed this today you know hit a thumbs up if you really agree with me on this leave me a comment if you got something to say guys thank you for watching and have a great day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RA7Vb329aSU," Gaby Lapera: I found this article on The Wall Street Journal about how forecasters did over the course of 2015. So, it provided what the average forecaster guessed what would happen for some kind of metric, and then it said what actually happened. And I thought it was kind of funny. So, do you want to talk about that? Jordan Wathen: Sure. Can we start with the big one? We'll start with the big miss first, because this makes me feel better about how my crazy predictions might not come to pass, and you might actually get a negative interest rate on your bank account. So, crude oil, December 2015, the average economist put it at $63 a barrel, and the actual as of December 29th was about $38 a barrel, which is a critically massive miss. Lapera: Yeah, it's so big. (laughs) Wathen: Yeah, it doesn't seem big, whatever, $25, I guess. Lapera: But, people all year -- so, these are guesses people make in January of 2015. So, people all year were saying, ""There's no way oil's going to get below $40 a barrel. I can't remember the last time that even happened."" And here we are.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RA7Vb329aSU,"What is it now? I think I read somewhere that the oil is actually cheaper than the container it is put inside of. The barrel costs more money. (laughs) Wathen: Right, the oil barrel costs more than the oil that's in it, yes, that's true. Lapera: (laughs) That's just crazy. So, this one is fun: the interest rate, since we were just talking about interest rates, the average forecaster said it was going to be at 1.6%, and the actual interest rate on December 16th, 2015, was 0.5%. Wathen: Big miss. Lapera: Yeah, people thought the economy was going to rally more, but we had so much global uncertainty, plus the oil, that it didn't really quite get back up to where they thought it was going to. Wathen: Right. Predicting interest rates ... talk about something that's just pulling numbers out of a hat. It's not easy to do. And for a long time -- actually, anyone listening should go online and google predictions about where interest rates were going to be since the Great Recession.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RA7Vb329aSU,"In every single year, the expectation was that rates would go higher, and then by the end of the year, it was like, ""No, we missed, interest rates are staying low forever, apparently."" And then, in January, I guess bonus time comes back around, and all the analysts are happy again, so then they predict, yet again, that interest rates will go higher, and they don't. (laughs) Not easy. Lapera: No, it's definitely ... I don't mean, if you're an analyst out there and you're listening to this and you're like, ""These guys should go walk off a short dock,"" (laughs) we're not making fun of you, we promise. We know it's really, really hard. It's just, it sucks, this is the nature of the job, you're going to be wrong. (laughs) Wathen: Right. I mean, I'm sure if a lot of these guys could, they'd just love to write, ""You know what? I don't know."" And that would be the most honest answer. But that's not what you get paid to do. Your job description isn't, ""Hey, just tell us that you don't know because we know you don't,"" it's, ""Hey, give us a best guess. Just guess.""",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RA7Vb329aSU,"Lapera: Yeah. And if you get it right, I'm sure you must get a bonus, right? Wathen: Right. If you get it right, you totally nail it, you get to go on CNBC and talk about how great you were, and then the next year you get to be proven wrong again. It's ... (laughs) Lapera: Exactly. Well, at least someone will buy you drinks that first time. (laughs) Wathen: Right, exactly. Lapera: Then, the Fed funds rate average forecast was 0.89%, and the actual as of December, 2015 was 0.375%. And the Fed funds rate, for our listeners who don't know, is the rate at which the Fed will give these very short overnight loans to banks. Wathen: So, this is basically Yellen. Lapera: Right. And the higher they are, the more expensive it is for banks to borrow money from the central banking agency. However, unemployment they got pretty much on the nose. Wathen: Right. Unemployment, they almost nailed it. Let's see ... they said average forecast 5.2%, and actual as of November was 5%. I think we're below 5% now. Lapera: I looked it up, we're barely, barely below 5% for 2016.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RA7Vb329aSU,"But in December of 2015, it was 5% exactly. Wathen: Nailed it. Lapera: Good job, guys. Whoever picked that one, really good job. And, for wage growth, which is average hourly wages, the percent change over last year, they had forecast 2.6%, and the actual for December 2015 was 2.3%. Good job. Wathen: It's not so surprising, actually. I thought about that a little bit, and if you get the unemployment rate right, you're probably going to nail wage growth, because if-- Lapera: That's true. Wathen: --unemployment is low, you expect wage growth to be x%. Lapera: Yeah. They were pretty good at a lot of the jobs metrics in general. Wathen: Right, yeah. Luckily, that's kind of been a thing where you can just say, ""Unemployment will go a little higher, wages might go a little higher."" There's a lot of industries right now that are really hurting from higher labor costs, which is, I guess, good if you're a worker, not so great if you're an investor. Lapera: Yeah (laughs). But, yeah, standards of living, that's nice. I don't miss those minimum wage days. Wathen: (laughs) No. Lapera: And, I was in high school",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
RA7Vb329aSU,"and I had parents supporting me. So, I can't even imagine what it would be like ... Wathen: Right. In high school, I worked at a golf course for all of about a month before I was promptly fired, and making minimum wage for that month was not fun. Lapera: Yeah. I guess I made minimum wage through most of college, too. Ugh. And, back then, it was low. Back then it was like $5.25 or something like that. Wathen: Right, yeah, no. Back when I was in college, it would have been something like that. I owned my own business in college. I was probably making minimum wage, though, because I was working way too much. Lapera: (laughs) And then, the last one we have for you guys is the real GDP. Forecast was 3%, and then I went and looked it up and the actual one was 2%. Wathen: Which, not too bad. That's kind of a hard one to nail, because, if you get the oil price wrong, you're going to miss that. Lapera: Yeah. So, all things considered, it wasn't a bad guess. Wathen: No, it wasn't really.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

T2MZzQqdQiA," - Okay, so I wanna start off this video here by asking you a question, and it's probably a question you've never been asked before but that is why do you have a bank account, why do you use a bank? And a lot of us don't really have a good answer for this question because the reason why a lot of us use a bank is because everybody else is using a bank, our parents have a bank account, our grandparents have a bank account, and when we became a certain age we also got our own bank accounts. Now there's absolutely nothing wrong with having a bank account. I have multiple different ones and I'm still going to use a bank but what I wanna show you guys in this video are a couple of things that the banks don't necessarily tell you or want you to know about their business. And banks do provide a very important service. We have money that we don't wanna leave out, we don't wanna be putting it under our mattress.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T2MZzQqdQiA,"We wanna put it in a safe place and to be honest with you guys, cash is not the most user friendly currency. In my opinion and obviously some older people will argue with this, I find using a card, debit card way more convenient or a credit card than paying in cash and carrying around change. So banks do provide us with a very useful service but there are a few things that you're going to want to know about using a bank account. And number one the first one is that you are actually losing money in most cases every single year with your bank account. Now I'm not talking about fees, we'll get to that later on. I'm not talking about them stealing your money, I'm talking about something else entirely called inflation. Now we've all been told that the bank is a safe place, it's the best place for your money, it's the safest place for your money but the bank is also in most cases a guaranteed place to lose your money because of our friend there inflation. And inflation is very simply an increase in the prices of goods and services over time.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T2MZzQqdQiA,"Meaning that $100 today will buy slightly less in a year and even less in five years. And so what you want to do as an investor is try to keep up with inflation and that just can't be accomplished in most bank accounts. So on average inflation sits at around 2% per year and we know that the average bank account in the United States pays about a 0.05% yield meaning that every single year most of us are losing about 1.95% of the buying power of that money we're holding in cash. Now there are definitely some alternatives to this. There are online bank accounts like Ally, there's Betterment Smart Saver, there's short term bonds. There are ways we can get a return on our investment without having all kinds of crazy risk and there are FDIC insured investments like CDs that will allow you to at least keep up with inflation. But we've talked about that a lot on my channel in the past. That's not the topic of this video. I'm gonna link up to another one that talks about how you can protect the buying power of your money and outpace inflation.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T2MZzQqdQiA,"Okay, so the second thing that a lot of people don't know about banks is that they earn money as you spend money, and that is through bank processing fees. So every time you go out there and you use your debit card, every time you swipe that debit card that merchant is paying a fee to the bank. And so a lot of people think of the bank as just a place to store your money but they're making money off of you in the process in a couple of different ways. That is why bank stocks are some of the most sought after investments out there. People, ya know a lot of people love investing in the banks because of all the different ways they make money and how they've become an everyday essential part of our lives. So every time you're at the store swiping your debit card, a small amount of money is going to your bank and that is typically being paid by the merchant. Okay number three, the third thing that is usually the most surprising thing for people is that the bank doesn't actually hold onto your money.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T2MZzQqdQiA,"I remember when I was a kid, I had a $2 bill that I found and actually someone gave it to me and I really wanted to hold onto it and I went to my dad and I said, I wanna put this in the bank that way I know it's going to be safe. And he said, that's the worst thing you wanna do because you're not gonna get that same $2 bill back. The way I imagined a bank was a box where they put my cash, but that's not how banks work at all because of something called fractional reserve banking. And this simply allows banks to loan out your money to other people. Now there are many good reasons for this. It frees up capital and it stimulates the economy but this fractional reserve banking resulted in a lot of the issues we had during the 2008 financial crisis when banks were overextended. So if for example ya know the bank had $100,000 of your money, they may not have your exact $100,000.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T2MZzQqdQiA,"Now they will have that amount of liquidity, assuming there is not something called a bank run and that's exactly what happened during the Great Depression. Everyone ran to the banks to withdraw their money at the same time out of fear and the banks simply did not have all that money on hand because of fractional reserve banking. Now is this something you have to lose sleep over? Not really, because we have FDIC insurance and you are protected with that money. If they were to go insolvent the US government would step in and they would protect people who had money with that bank but it is something that is worth understanding. Is that the bank takes your money and they loan it out to other people. They loan it out in the form of auto loans and mortgages and they collect interest on that and then they turn around and they pay you .05% yield on your checking or savings account. Number four, this is one of the dirtiest secrets of banking and I was just a victim of this a couple of months ago.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T2MZzQqdQiA,"And this is the fact that the banks typically wait until the perfect time to strike and that time is when you are traveling out of the country. What I'm getting at here is something called the foreign transaction fee. So most banks don't go crazy with the fees, otherwise you would leave them and you would say, ya know this is ridiculous. I'm not paying all these fees. I'm gonna switch to a different bank. But there are certain situations when banks have an absolute hay day and one of these is when you are traveling overseas, using your United States credit card or debit card. Now some credit cards to have programs where they do have coverage in different countries for free. I'm not a part of any of those, I probably should be after my learning experience here. But they will literally make a ton of money when you go overseas or you just leave the country and still use your US debit card. So back in January I went down to Mexico for 10 days. I was in Todos Santos and I used my debit card down there because they accepted it",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T2MZzQqdQiA,"and I really didn't think anything of it. And then when I got home I opened up my bank statement and I could not believe what I saw. All of these different foreign transaction fees from every single swipe that I did while I was down in Mexico. And in total during the 10 days I was there that was $75.63 in foreign transaction fees that went into the pocket of my bank. Meanwhile, they're also making money from that merchant, they're making money from these fees, they had an absolute hay day with me. And obviously most banks are gonna charge us foreign transaction fee. If you're going to be traveling for an extended period of time or traveling a lot you're gonna want to find a way to spend your money without paying these fees but this is one area where banks absolutely capitalize on you is when you are traveling out of the country. And in the fifth and final thing that a lot of people don't know about banks is that they are watching you.",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T2MZzQqdQiA,"Banks keep track of your financial activity and they are required by the US Treasury Department to report certain suspicious activity to the IRS. And now this is obviously in place because of a lot of shady stuff that was going on back in the day. It had to do with money laundering and back in 1970 they passed this Bank Secrecy Act which essentially strong armed the bank and forced them to report activity over a certain dollar amount to the IRS that way they could look into it when it came to the time of year when you're reporting your taxes. So if you withdraw or deposit more than $10,000 into your bank account in the United States that activity is being reported to the IRS. And if you were to be audited, they're gonna be bringing that up and they're gonna say okay, large sums of money went into your account or went out of your account. We wanna ask you why exactly that was? What were you doing with this money and are you paying taxes on it? Do you have any kind of illegal stuff going on in the background?",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
T2MZzQqdQiA,"And so that is something you have to understand as someone who uses a bank, your activity is being watched and in some cases it is being shared with the IRS. So anyways guys, I thought this was kind of an interesting video. We all take bank accounts for granted. I would say 99.9% of us have them but this is five things that a lot of people don't know about banks and I hope you guys found this to be interesting.

fFe3cSVnlmo,and then you don't have this build up of things you are procrastinating on now if the five minute rule is too much for you you can change it to a three minute rule or even a one minute rule to get started but getting rid of this procrastination has been absolutely huge for my success being able to get more done and not having these things pile up for me you know taking care of things as they come up if they're going to take less than five minutes do it now and get it out of the way now as far as where I learned that lesson I can't exactly remember I believe it was just a simple YouTube video I was watching on how to be more productive but after I heard that I knew it was gonna be an absolute game changer and I started implementing that into my life from day one number two the second habit that made a huge change in my life is following the 80/20 rule which comes out of the book the 4-hour workweek by Tim Ferriss if you guys have not read that book make sure you grab a copy I will link up to it in the description below but the 8020 rule is such an important concept especially if you own your own business and essentially what this says here is that about 80% of your results in your business or anything you're doing are derived from 20% of your efforts and the other 80% of your efforts are yielding your just 20% of your results and so if you eliminate that 80% and just focus on the 20% that is having the largest ROI for you you're going to be so much more successful and I implemented this strategy in my own business with affiliate marketing last summer I was at a bit of a crossroads with my business I didn't necessarily know how to grow my business past a certain dollar amount and I had a number of different options in front of me and I simply applied the 80/20 rule and I trimmed out all the fat of my business I had these things I was doing them we're not making me more money I needed to delegate more and get stuff off my plate and I eliminated that 80% and then focused a hundred percent of my efforts on the 20% that was driving most of the results and as a result I took my business from ten or fifteen thousand,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fFe3cSVnlmo,a month to thirty to sixty thousand in a very short period of time by putting all of my efforts on what was yielding me the most results so applying the 80/20 rule to your business or your own life is another huge game-changer and it's a rich person habit you must develop third and finally is the $100 rule and actually learned this from a friend of mine he has a YouTube channel called Bulldog mind set his name is John Sam Nez and I was sitting down with him for dinner and he basically told me about this $100 rule where for him he sets the dollar amount at one hundred dollars anything less than a hundred dollars if he's spending money on it he doesn't bother trying to get the best possible price because it's not worth his time to go out there and chase down a sale to save a couple of dollars now does the $100 rule make sense for everybody absolutely not if you're not in a position where you're making you know six figures or multiple six figures you may still want to try to save money on things when you're buying them but you may find it makes sense to have a five-dollar rule or a ten dollar rule or a twenty dollar rule where if you're spending less than that dollar amount of money you're not gonna bother trying to get the best possible price for because it's just not the best use of your time so just to give you guys an example of that when I was younger,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fFe3cSVnlmo,my mom and I used to have to try to save a lot of money when we were grocery shopping and so we would clip coupons on every Sunday we'd go through the paper clip out coupons and we would go to multiple different stores to try to get the best possible deals taking advantage of sales now at that point in my life I wasn't making much of any money I was pushing carts at a grocery store,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fFe3cSVnlmo,and so it made sense for us to be saving a couple dollars here and there now at this point in my life because I'm making substantially more income it doesn't make any sense to clip coupons and try to save 50 cents or a dollar because of how much I'm earning my time is better spent earning more money as opposed to trying to pinch pennies and you know clip coupons and save a couple of dollars so the dollar amount for this rule is relative to how much money you're earning it might not be worth it for you to chase down a sale for something under 20 dollars but if it's under $100 it might be but I just want you guys to consider how much time you're spending chasing down sales and saving a couple of dollars and whether or not that is the best and most effective use of your time but anyways guys that's gonna wrap up this video those are the three rich people habits that have had the biggest impact on my life and allowed me to be you know a lot more successful than I was even six months ago and especially a year ago and I would highly recommend you know considering picking up at least one of these habits and making it a part of your everyday routine,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fFe3cSVnlmo,but I'd love to hear what you guys think about these let me know in the comments section below what habits you follow if you guys follow any of these habits or rules outlined i'm always looking to learn new strategies and new ideas from you guys too but thank you so much for watching this video I hope you enjoyed it and I will see you in the next one,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,why are we programmed for mediocrity I'm sure that is your question if you guys clicked on this video and you're watching it so the reason I made this video is because I think there are a number of reasons why most people out there do what it is that they do why most people go out there and they get a nine-to-five job whether or not they actually have interest in that line of work and they tend to just follow the structure that society set out for us and there are five main reasons that I came across in my own journey of going from that nine-to-five lifestyle to being an entrepreneur that were really the barriers for me and a lot of it has to do with the public schooling system as well as just your upbringing and the people you surround yourself with so I want to share with you guys the five reasons why I had a lot of trouble actually moving from living in a structured life and having that nine-to-five job to actually taking a risk in being an entrepreneur and it's the best decision I've ever made in my life now a lot of people are just petrified of going out and trying something new and actually doing something they want to do with their life and it's absolutely crazy to me,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,but I was in that situation for a long time I spent months you know deciding whether or not I wanted to pursue what I do full-time or just keep doing it on the side while working my job but these are the five reasons why I would say most of us out there are programmed or you know set up for mediocrity and I'm not saying this is a bad thing and if you are fine with working a job then you know that's not a problem because what matters most is what I actually makes you happy and I know myself working that nine-to-five job I was unhappy but I know a lot of people that are very happy doing jobs,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,"and you know doing a very simple job and then going home and not having to worry about things because as an entrepreneur you constantly have to think about your business and what you're doing and I understand that with a nine-to-five job you know you stop thinking about your job at 5:01 and you don't have to think about it again until the next morning so there are definitely reasons why people like but the main reason or the main barrier that I had when I was growing up or one of the things that I taught that was not true one of the things people taught me was that $100,000 is rich I can remember talking to my parents and asking them like hey you know we got a neighbor who had nicer cars and the kid at the point at that time had a PlayStation 2 and I was like you know why don't we have why don't we have nice cars why don't I have a Playstation 2",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,I was a kid at the time and I remember my parents were like well they're rich and I was like well what is rich and they're like well they have a lot of money and I said well how much is a lot of money,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,"and I think my dad said $100,000 you know that's a lot of money if you're making that much money every year so from that point forward that's where I set the bar I set the bar at $100,000 as being rich and as a result then going forward all the strides that I made all the decisions that I made in my life were based on the end goal of you know making a hundred thousand dollars and it wasn't until I really started learning about you know making money that I realized that a hundred thousand dollars a year is not rich in fact that's enough to you know have a pretty simple life and maybe have enough to go on vacation once or twice a year and drive a newer car I mean a hundred thousand dollars is not rich and because I was taught that at a young age I had this idea that that's what I should strive for and now thinking back imagine if I had thought that 1 million dollars a year was rich well that would mean that all of those decisions that I would have made early on would have been with the end goal of making a million dollars a year and it's possible it's it's just as possible to make a hundred thousand a year as it is to make a million a year the only difference is the strides that you're taking in the decisions that you're making",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,and I just didn't realize this based on the fact that you know I was told that that's rich 100 grand you're set you're rich at that point the second thing is that I was taught that any kind of risk is dangerous I mean I was petrified of risk I can remember when I was contemplating you know quitting my job an entrepreneur I thought that if I quit my job I would literally die I mean I felt like if I ran out of money I would die I would be dead and I can remember having a conversation with a good friend of mine who's really kind of a mentor to me as well he had done the same thing before me started pursuing his dream and I was very envious of him and I can remember that conversation we had where he was calling me he was off I think he was at his pool you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,and I was sitting in my car at lunch because I just wanted to not be around those negative people and he was like what's gonna happen to you if you quit your job are you gonna die if you if you run out of money do you die and I was like there's a first time I realized I'm like you're not going to just die you're not gonna just end up you know you're not going to end up in a terrible situation if you take a risk worst-case scenario for me would have been I quit my job I burned through all my money and I get a new job my whole mindset at that point I've realized like what I could do is yeah save up some money working a job quit that job try something if it doesn't work save up money and try again,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,I mean I knew that that life was not for me but for whatever reason and largely it had to do with conditioning from society and just the fact that so many people tell you that businesses fail don't take a risk we are so we are just so conditioned to believe that risk is bad that it just petrifies us to the point we won't even take any risk even a healthy amount of risk and it really makes people feel stuck in their lives and you know discourages people from pursuing their dreams the third thing that really held me back was this idea that one size fits all and this is really something I learned from the public education system and it has to do with the fact that everyone out there has a different learning style and different interests but they're all funneled through the same exact system I mean,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,yeah you can go and decide you want to take different history classes or other classes with technology but for the most part we are all taught in the same way and the resources available to us are very limited so we are really told and instructed in a way and pushed in a way that the one-size-fits-all that everyone to follow this path I mean I can remember when I graduated high school I had no idea there was another path outside of going to college and getting a job it was like I was brainwashed and really in a way you are I mean I'm not saying that the public schooling system is the worst thing in the world and if you are a young person watching this I'd not despite not encouraging that you go out there and you know drop out of high school or not go to college you've got to do whatever it is that you want to do,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,but maybe the college part if you know you want to be an entrepreneur you know just go out there and do it stop stop asking for permission and don't be afraid to take a risk don't be petrified by that risk but because of our public schooling system and the fact that everyone is taught in the same way it's like we feel there's one path there's only one direction you can go and that is to go out there you know get an education get a job and you know work for the rest of your life and there are so many different things you can do with your life in so many different ways you can make money and a lot of people because we're all different a lot of people don't fit into that one-size-fits-all structure that the schooling system really sets us up for now the fourth reason you know the fourth thing that really is of setting you up for mediocrity in life is this idea of knowledge versus wisdom now what I think about is this there's a big difference between learning something and then memorizing something and I would say that the first part of school when you're learning how to do cursive,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,and you're learning how to write and you're learning how to read and you're learning about animals and dissecting things and doing all this hands-on stuff that is what you call learning we are actually experiencing it and at a certain point school shifts from learning to memorization and it happens around middle school or high school for most people and by the time I was in high school I didn't have a single class that was hands-on and all I was doing was reading books or being taught out of a book and then reciting that information back out onto paper and that is not nah that is not wisdom that is knowledge that is useless information at that point when you're in your younger years and you're actually learning hands-on and doing things that is that is wisdom that is what you want and your action learning but at a certain point you're just consuming information and regurgitating it and what do you benefit from that and there's just so many reasons why the schooling system makes absolutely no sense but I'm not going to get into that now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,but if you think about it when would you ever be in a situation where you wouldn't have resources in front of you to actually thoroughly research and figure out the problem I mean are you ever gonna sit down at your job and your employer is going to tell you I want you to complete this task without using any resources in a quiet room at this desk and you need to be done in one hour and you can't ask anyone for help that is stupid okay that is what the schooling system teaches us and that is what they train you to do and that ties into my fifth reason why we are programmed to just be mediocre is the fact that communication is bad we're taught that communication is bad when we're in school and when we're working on a test if we talk to someone it's called cheating however collaboration is one of the most important aspects of any project if you want to get anything done you need many people working together on that project,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,and you need to learn to work with other people and combine all of your creative powers into one and work on one common goal or task but there's none of that in school there's none of that group working it's all solo work and you know do your tests on your own what would make more sense is if people were divided into groups and they were given one problem and they all work together to solve that problem I mean I know there are some aspects of classes that are like that but the fact that we sit down and take a test and just you know regurgitate information instead of communicating with each other and working on a problem and using all the resources available to us it's absurd and that is really the fifth reason why I think we are just programmed to be mediocre and I don't know guys this is just something that I've been wanting to do a video on,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t8hDFLksrHE,and I really took a while to think about the five core reasons why I was afraid to take that leap of faith and become an entrepreneur and a lot of it had to do with these things that conditioned me whether it be from my own life or people around me or the schooling's so that's all I got for this video if you guys agree with me or disagree with me please leave me a comment below if you guys enjoyed this video please drop a like and if you are new to my channel please consider subscribing to be notified of future uploads and I hope you have a great rest of your day and I thank you for watching this video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g, you hey guys tom here from the investing with tom youtube channel welcome back to the channel if you enjoy today's video hit like hit subscribe and that way you can see future videos as well so today we're going to be talking about cash how much should you have in your portfolio and how should you think about what those proportions kind of look like over time and this to be honest as one of the main things in investing that I've really struggled to get some solid sort of guidelines around so I was recently watching a presentation the other day by one of my favorite investors - / Bry the author of the dando and Vista a book I'm currently reading at the moment and in their presentation which I'll link in the description below he talked about cash and how he thinks about cash how much he thinks about you know he should be investing in the stock market versus holding and cash should there be short-term fluctuations in the market and the framework that he kind of puts around that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,so it's really the first time I've ever heard anyone kind of dive into using actual numbers and kind of quantifying how they think about some of the stuff which personally is something I really need and investing is to have some solid numbers around some of these guidelines so it's something I spoke about a little bit of my live stream the other day,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,but I wanted to dive into a little bit more detail around some of provides thinking here and some of the reasons I really like it so with any video like this not financial advice do your own research so on so on in STEM purposes only but for now let's get into it let's talk about how purbright thinks about his cash position and to be honest this is probably a philosophy that I'm going to be taking on board with my own stock market portfolio as well so hope you enjoy it let's get into the video before we get into some of the pros and cons of this particular strategy let me give you the strategy itself - basically has several different thresholds upon which he will continue to take more of his available cash and deploy that and to opportunities in the stock market so if he can't meet let's say the second criteria on this sort of list then he won't envious the-the-the further amount of cash that comes along with that sort of second threshold so let me walk you through this list essentially per Bri will invest up to seventy five percent of his available cash if he has opportunities where he sees at least a double over the next three to five years that's not a timeframe that he specifically mentions in this video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,but I know from watching several months prior videos and reading his book and so on that's really the timeframe we're going to be talking about here is a double within three to five years so if he finds a number four opportunities that fit into that category he will invest up to seventy five percent of his available capital and leave twenty five percent of his available capital and cash and short-term bonds those sorts of things generating at the moment with such low interest rates and not much money at all but it's set in there should market prices fluctuate and he gets a further opportunity to invest more so seventy five percent up to seventy five percent of the portfolio and to at least doubles is kind of the first threshold the next threshold is applicable to the next ten percent of the portfolio so if he finds stocks that he thinks will at least triple in the next three or five years that's when he's invest in the next team Cena versus Palio he's getting up to 85 percent invested and that's the next threshold,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,so the threshold after that is again ten percent this time he's looking for stocks that can 4x in the next three or five years turn one dollar into four dollars over that period of time and if we can find opportunities that fit that category he is going to invest an additional ten percent so if you're doing the maths at home this takes them up to about 95 percent invested so almost all the way out of cash almost has every single cent working for him at this point it just leaves them with five percent sitting in available cash again should we have big market fluctuations and some really attractive opportunities come up so that last 5% as White's mounish provide calls very expensive capital and that essentially means that this will pretty much always say in cash because he always wants to have at least some cash available to again jump on opportunities as they come up unless he sees an opportunity where he can get at least a 5 X and 3 to 5 years so turning one dollar into five dollars over the next three to five years again with relatively low risk because he's not trying to do this by buying high-flying growth stocks and extreme speculation or anything he's trying to find a really deeply under valued situations but long story short he will be looking to invest that final five percent of the portfolio should he find something that he thinks can 5x over three to five years,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,so those are the thresholds up 75 percent of who have got doubles another 10 percent if we've got triples another 10% if we've got four X's and that final 5% if we have five X's available for investment so that's the framework I really like it so I want to just get into some detail around the pros the cons and the way I kind of think about this these guidelines from I'm sure Bryce so let's get into that so first I just want to talk about one of the cons to the strategy the list of cons isn't particularly long but one of them on there is quite a powerful negative with having a lot of money in cash so basically it's called cash drag essentially what cash drag is is you having a portion of the portfolio not invested and essentially whatever your return is in the stock market that year having a percentage of your portfolio sitting in cash will sort of drag that return back towards zero,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,"so what I mean by that let's say you have 25 percent of the portfolio sitting in cash so and monus's situation the best you can find as doubles over the next three to five years then you're going to have that 25 percent really pull down your returns so to make the math simple for this example let's say that that 25 percent that sitting in cash effectively makes zero return because interest rates are so low we can get some return out there but let's just assume for this example that at 0 if you have 75 percent of the portfolio Vista and that portion of the portfolio makes a 10 percent positive return in the stock market but you happen to have had that 25 percent in cash then your overall return for that portfolio is 7.5 percent so over a long period of time I'll put some compound interest calculator sort of screenshots up here you'll see that over a 20-year period of time this can actually take a $10,000 investment from turning into sixty seven thousand dollars if it were fully invested right down to $42,000 so that's really the main disadvantage of cash drag and",overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,that that's really the main contour this one the pros for me probably outweigh the cons this really assumes that you always have 25% of the portfolio on cash and you never buy things when they're cheap and so on I think as a value investor and as someone like / Breyer is able to do you're able to identify when things are really expensive when things are really cheap and when things are really cheap you can put that money to work at really good rates so for example if your average returners of it of that money that's invested to say 10% and you have 25% sitting in cash just as in our previous example at times where you put that 25% to work that 25% might begin invested at a time when prices are really low and that portion of the portfolio might be doing 25 or 30% a year and really juicing up those returns so if you balance out the 25 and 30% a year returns on that portion of money and then you also mix it in with a few years of near enough zero returns it can still balance out to be a really really good rate and that's the main reason why people like to have a portion of the portfolio in cash as they can jump on these cheap opportunities and really ramp up their rate of return and future years after that so that's the main con as cash drag if you're not someone who thinks you can confidently identify those those deep discounts to intrinsic value that is going to be a negative for you at something mutual funds and ETFs ters and so on talked about a lot so much individual stock pickers you see people like Warren Buffett currently sitting with 128 billion dollars in cash within Berkshire Hathaway so there's definitely a lot of people very comfortable with sittin in cash and that have a history of keeping a large proportion of cash and their portfolio at certain times and over the you know by and large it's worked out very very well for those people and that's the reason they're famous,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,so that's the main con I really want to get into the prose and talk through some of the pros with this particular strategy some of the reasons I really really like it so let's get into that okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,so let's get into some of the reasons I really like the strategy let's get into some of the pros the first reason I really like the strategy is because it assumes that the investor can do a couple of different things and if you're someone that wants to take the strategy on board it's gonna have to force you to be able to do those things so the first thing has been able to actually figure out what type of return you should expect to make from an investment I know that sounds really really basic to a lot of people but unfortunately a lot of people that are investing in the stock market really are speculating the looking at companies that they like they're not paying a particularly large amount of attention to the valuations that they're actually buying into those companies that they just want to say you know I want to put a thousand dollars into Apple or I want to put a thousand dollars and two whatever stock it is and they're really not looking at okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,I'm putting a thousand dollars in what am I actually likely to get back and what's some of the the simple maths behind that stuff kind of look like so the first thing that that's this particular strategy around cash management really enforces it has been able to actually have a good idea of the returns you're going to make pay attention to valuations on the company and that's why you know one of the main reasons I'm a big fan of it so I've got a valuation video on the channel that's the most popular video on this channel and I am well overdue to do an update on it because my strategy has or my philosophy has changed slightly on approaching valuation so keep an eye out for that video we'll get into that at some point,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,but basically you need to know what the intrinsic value of a company is when you buy it you want to be buying it at a discount and we're - provide talks about looking for doubles or triples or for exes again he's not talking about companies growing at insane rates he's not investing in not just kind of not to go after anyone invest in this company but he's not looking for the Tesla's of the world and things that are experiencing really rapid growth if you read a lot of his writings he's talking about investing in businesses with very slow rates of change simple businesses that are easy to understand and ones that you can get a really good idea of the cash returns from so when he's looking for a 2 or 3 or 4x he's not looking for things that will be worth a dollar today and will grow to have an intrinsic value much higher in the future that may be a component of what he's looking at but really what he's looking at is he wants to identify something worth a dollar,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,and he wants to buy it for 50 cents or less so if we can buy it for 50 cents and it goes up to that dollar that discount to intrinsic value kind of closes over time he's God has double if he buys it at 30 cents on the dollar and again that closes that gap closes over three to five years he's got his triple and so on and so on so he's looking more at those really big deep deeply discounted pies as he would call them not necessarily looking at massive growth,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,so he's not getting more and more kind of speculative as he goes down this this track and looks for three and four and five X's he's in fact getting less and less speculative he's finding deals that are so unbelievably compelling that you would be stupid not to put a large proportion of money into those deals you know he's he's identifying things where companies that he thinks are worth a billion dollars and he can buy them at valuations of a hundred million dollars you know and sanely deep discounts like that where for whatever reason people on the stock market just don't want to own those things at that time so that's one of the reasons I really like the strategy forces you to quantify things forces you to be an investor rather than a Speculator and that's never a bad thing for your investment returns so that's one of the main reasons I like the strategy the other reason I really like it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,and we've talked about this a lot throughout the video has it sort of it always leaves you open for opportunities so if we do have fluctuations in prices over time you should pretty much always have a portion of cash ready to go the only time really that you are going to be fully invested using a strategy like this has been in the depths of a recession and like a 2008-2009 kind of period of time where there are just so many ridiculously cheap stocks around that you would get invested very quickly so that's something that / Bry has done he got heavily invested during that time and although his portfolio got rather beat up during 2007 and 2008 with the big drop he had many many many multi Beggar's kind of on the way out and recovered really well and made further gains over and above that as a result so that's one things I like you've pretty much always got something sitting in cash at this stage at the moment you know personally at least I'm not finding too many really compelling opportunities so if I was following this monas strategy which was something I am going to adopt I would be starting to having a much higher proportion of my portfolio in cash and it leaves me in a really good position should market prices go down at some point so that's one of the things I really like is - provides framework for thinking about a cash position in a portfolio,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
imkhwaK-c0g,and I really like it like I said it's the first time I've really heard someone get into actual numbers and quantify some of that cash we often hear about people you know having half the portfolio on cash or being a hundred percent in cash and completely out of the market because they think this thing's so high and I really like the fact that you know we're able to actually put some numbers and some guidelines on this and it will vary that you know the positions of cash we have will vary depending on the opportunities each individual is looking at and what they're able to find so I really liked it I hope you did too,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

didMRUT06Jk,now there are three resources I want to give a shout out to that help me put together some of the facts for this video firstly as a YouTube channel called IDP which actually shows the clip of Charlie Munger talking about this investment in tinico a blog called broken leg investing which pulled a lot of the financial metrics from the early 2000s about tenaco and finally Focus compounding which is a podcast actually listened to pretty regularly they did a great breakdown on the tinico investment from Charlie Munger back in early 2021.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,now I want to start this video off actually by playing a short clip from Charlie Munger this a clip taken after the Daily Journal annual meeting a few years ago where he talked about the technical investment he didn't mention the company specifically but he says some really interesting things here about how he was thinking about the investment at the time I read Barons for 50 years in 50 years I found one investment opportunity and bearings other which I made about 80 million dollars there's almost no risk I took the 80 million nurse and gave it to Lilo who turned it into four or five hundred million dollars it was a little automotive supply company anyway it was it was a cigar buff it was the Monroe shock absorber and all that stuff the stock was a dollar and the junk bonds was paid eleven three eighths percent were 35. and I bought the junk bombs they paid me the 35 percent they went right to 107 when they called you know it was and then they and the stock went from 1 to 40 but of course I sold my stock at 15.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,I I kind of knew based on experience how sticky some of that Auto secondary Market was and how many old cars needed Monroe shocking servers and I I just knew it was too it was too cheap I didn't know it would work for sure but I know that I knew that I just as I say people were afraid it was going to go broke obviously if their Bonds were selling at 35.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,so pretty interesting story there from Charlie he read Barons for 50 years which uh you know every single week was filled with stock tips he ended up after 50 years of reading Barons pouncing on a single stock investment idea uh which was tinico which is the company that I will cover in this video uh made 80 million dollars with basically no risk so how on Earth does that happen well um let's kind of talk through basically what tinaco is and what this situation was at the time well technical is basically an auto parts manufacturer it's an okay business um part of their business that Charlie Munger was familiar with was basically this Monroe shock absorber which he felt was a pretty sticky product particularly in many older vehicles and he recognized that tinaco had kind of an okay operating business,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,but it was a situation where the company had a lot of debts and they were really really kind of struggling to meet their debt servicing obligation and there was a lot of fear on the market at the time basically around tunico going bankrupt now in the 1990s tinoco produced Ebert Dyer of about three to four hundred million dollars a year they produce net income of 250 to 300 million dollars a year and the stock hit an all-time high in the 1990s of about 56 dollars per share now when Charlie Munger got interested in investing in tenaco having read about the stock and Barons we're in kind of the early 2000s and net income had gone from that 250 or 300 million a year to about negative 40 million a year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,and they actually had um kind of one year on there which was negative 420 million so they turned into a business that was producing reasonably consistent cash flows to a company that was suddenly losing a lot of money and producing negative earnings they got to a point where they had negative shareholders equity they had increasing levels of deutin all kind of along the storyline here there were increasingly more and more fears of bankruptcy now one of the interesting things with tanako was that if you look at the operating cash flow from the business uh tinaco actually consistently produced positive operating cash flow and it's kind of clear from looking at that data that chinaco was an okay operating business they had really just got themselves into a situation where they had taken on too much debt there is some kind of capital expenditure that the business has to you know basically spend each year out of that operating cash flow they had a huge amount of money that was being funneled towards trying to service this massive amount of debt and they got themselves into a situation where they were basically just running out of money and just to give you a feel for how over leveraged tinaco became it got down to a point where the market cap was as low as about 80 million dollars yet the Enterprise Value was about 1.6 billion dollars so um an analogy I always like to use just to explain the difference between market cap and Enterprise Value which in fact is in kind of debt and cash that the business might have it's just to think about it like a simple real estate property so think of teneco like a 1.6 billion dollar real estate property uh it has about 1.52 billion of debt on it so uh kind of the equity value of the house is only about 80 million dollars so even though the value of the Enterprise is about 1.6 billion I've got so much debt that there's really only this thin Little slice of about 80 million dollars of equity remaining or at least that's what the market was valuing it at kind of at the time and leverage of course is a double-edged sword you know if that Enterprise Value was to go from say 1.6 billion to 2 billion uh the market cap or the equity would grow very substantially you know if there is a three or four hundred million dollar increase in the Enterprise Value you're going to get that same three or four hundred million dollar increase on the market cap only you're starting at a very low base the market cap at the time was only 80 million dollars,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,so although there's certainly High chances of downside here and of course if technico were to go bankrupt the stock would go to zero you can see that there is also potential for a lot of upside with all the leverage built into this situation now one of the fascinating things here with technical is that Charlie Munger actually invested in tinaco in two different ways he bought the stock I guess as would expect from a very well-known stock investor but he actually also bought the bonds of tinaco and I think there's probably a couple of reasons why he bought both the stock and the bonds had a slightly different kind of upside and downside potential the bonds were probably slightly lower risk in terms of downside protection but a little less upside as well whereas the stock had the potential for a lot of upside as of kind of just talked through with you know this very leveraged kind of situation but there was also Wipeout risk you know if tinaco did go into bankruptcy there was uh you know it was basically a certainty that the stock would go to zero as well so firstly let's take a look at the bombs now Tina Co had bonds out that paid 11 and 3 8 interest or 11.375 interest and they were trading at 35 cents on the dollar so that just gives you a feel for how much fear there was around bondholders not getting the cash back from you know Tunica going into bankruptcy so um since Charlie Munger was able to buy those you know 11 handsome change interest bonds at 35 cents on the dollar that gave him basically annual interest payments of about 32.5 percent,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,so um assuming that tinaco could continue to meet their interest obligations he was going to buy bonds yielding 30 plus percent which is a massive kind of coupon massive interest payment to get on your bond investment there is also more upside than that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,so if Tina Co can kind of sort their financing problems out and the bond market becomes more confident and tenaco being able to service their debt over time then there's a good chance that those bonds trading at 35 cents on the dollar re-rate that closer to par or back to you know a dollar on the dollar and that is actually exactly what happened or actually they did even slightly better than that again so a couple years later teneco actually went through a bit of a refinancing exercise and they repurchased those bonds at a dollar seven so Charlie Munger rode those bonds from 35 cents to 1.07 so a little more than a 3X return on the bond investment plus of course he was getting about 32 and a half percent interest on the bonds every year in the meantime now although the upside on that Bond investment was fantastic and the stock was even better which we'll talk about in a sec Charlie manga talked about this investment as if it had basically no risk and I believe Charlie Munger probably thought there was basically no risk because he bought these bonds so cheap he bought them at 35 cents on the dollar so that even if tinaco did go into bankruptcy and the bondholders took a haircut and got paid only say 50 cents on the dollar you know he bought them at 35 cents on the dollar,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,so I think that is massive risk mitigation from manga and that's probably one of the reasons why he talks about it in that way and of course tenaco did have a good operating business it was really just the fact that they got over leveraged was what was really causing the issues so if tinoco did go bankrupt and that Bond holding was converted to equity you know manga would own a reasonable business and like I say even if he got a haircut he bought those bonds at such a discount that he was probably still likely to do pretty well now of course tenaco didn't go bankrupt and the bond investment worked out great just as I as I said earlier which means that the stock actually did even better so the stock obviously didn't have the downside protection of of tinico were to go into a bankruptcy like the bond investment probably did,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,but it had a lot more upside should tinoco be able to get through some of these issues and that is exactly what happened so and the investment thesis basically was that tinaco can probably return to something like three to four hundred million dollars a year in ebitda and looking at similar kind of auto parts manufacturing type businesses at the time it looked like the industry standard multiple of ebitda was probably about 6.5 times,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,so if they could return to more normal kind of business operations it's likely that the Enterprise Value would fall somewhere in the 2 to 2.6 billion dollar range which after you back out the debt of 1.52 billion implied an equity value of about 430 million to about 1.08 billion so that would take a stock that Charlie Munger probably paid somewhere in the one to two dollar range for uh to anywhere from 10 to 27 per share and again that's basically exactly what happened so uh Charlie Munger does say in the video he paid about a dollar a year looking at some of the numbers and where the stock actually got down to I'm guessing he probably paid somewhere around a dollar fifty something like that maybe even closer to two dollars but he ended up selling the stock for about 15 and tinakoshi is actually carried on much higher than that as I'll put on the screen here but nonetheless to write a stock from one or two dollars a share up to Fifteen uh it's an exceptional result and combine that with the bonds which also gave him a 3X and 30 interest a year in the meantime uh the whole tineco situation worked out exceptionally well for Charlie Munger so of course Charlie Munger has a reputation of the guy that convinced Buffett to buy great businesses at a fair price right rather than for your businesses at a great price but Charlie Munger himself from the early 2000s was still out buying cigar butts and was still out producing multi-baggers in the process I think tinaco is a fascinating example of that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
didMRUT06Jk,and it's actually one of the only examples that I've seen of Charlie Munger making a bond investment as well so it's a really different approach to what we've seen and other kind of great business Investments like you know the Coca-Cola investment or the Apple investment through Berkshire Hathaway or even something like bungabyna to Costco you know personally in the early 2000s so I do hope you enjoyed that story if you did please hit like and hit subscribe as well that way you can see the next couple of Charlie manga greatest hits videos coming up soon but uh that's it for me for this one and I'll see you on the next video cheers,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YnQbsuWC3F0, hi i'm jimmy in this video we're going to look quickly at the rule of 72 the goal of this video is to help us quickly be able to calculate either what interest rate we may need in order for our investments to double up or how long it will take for those investments to double so how long will it take for us to double our money so this is a fairly simple calculation and the video shouldn't be too long at all but before we get into the calculation itself i think we should really clarify the difference between compound interest and simple interest so let's imagine that we have ten thousand dollars and we say okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YnQbsuWC3F0,we're gonna earn ten percent a year for the next ten years well ten percent of ten thousand dollars is we could say okay that's a thousand dollars a year ten years that's ten thousand dollars that we've earned therefore in ten years we've doubled our money but this is simple interest we know that it's simple interest because the assumption here is that our one thousand dollars that we earn each year isn't earning anything for us compound interest on the other hand is when we assume that the interest that we earn will then be reinvested and earn interest for us so if it takes 10 years to double our money with simple interest how long will it take to double our money with compound interest well this is where the rule of 72 comes in and it's really quite simple so we take 72 and we divide that by our expected return in our case we're saying 10 and we need to divide this by the whole number so i know that 10 is actually 0.10 but we're just going to say 10.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YnQbsuWC3F0,so 72 divided by 10 tells us that it will take 7.2 years to double our money using compound interest if we can earn 10 a year simple enough so what if we earn 5 a year well 72 divided by five and just like that we know that it takes 14 and a half years give or take to double our money but what if we said hey i want to double our money in five years what do we need how much do we need to earn to make that happen well the rule 72 once again works for us so we take 72 we divide it by five which represents the five years that we're looking to invest and just like that we realize that we need to earn 14.4 percent to double our money in five years now for all of the critics out there we might look at this and say well it doesn't really work what if i wanted to double my money in one year well 72 divided by one and we get 72 percent,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YnQbsuWC3F0,and yes this is true the rule of 72 is supposed to be a quick and dirty way to make calculations and it's not nearly as effective on the extremes so one years two years three years it's somewhat weak but it's getting closer as the number of years increase so with our five-year example well the exact math if we were to earn 14.4 percent for five years assuming we started with ten thousand dollars well at the end of five years we would have nineteen thousand five hundred ninety four dollars so not exactly twenty thousand not exactly a double of our money but fairly close considering how quick and simple the math is and this is also true when we're calculating the number of years so let's say we're going to earn 72 percent well 72 divided by 72 is one year but as we know we need 100 to double our money so we didn't in fact double our money with 72 percent once again we have to stay away from the extremes so if we stay with let's say reasonable numbers then this shortcut could really serve us well,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
YnQbsuWC3F0,and i'm guessing that most of us want to earn as high of a return as possible to help us double our money faster and i think a lot of that comes down to our ability to invest smartly and if we're going to invest in individual companies i think we need to make sure that we have a good understanding of that company and i actually did a video where i go through the eight steps of analyzing a stock and if you're curious perhaps that could be a good next video for you to watch i've got a link right here i've got a link in the description below and thank you so much for sticking with me all the way to the end of the video i really appreciate it thanks and i'll see in the next video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0, hi I'm Jimmy in this video we're looking at how interest rate affect the economy and how changes in interest rates can affect things for investors and then ideally we can use this information to help us get closer to our personal goal of achieving financial freedom okay so just a few days ago the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates with the surprise 50 basis point cut that's the same as 1/2 of 1% now this video isn't exclusively tied to that particular cut this video is more designed for us to get a better understanding of what happens in general when the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates or if they raise interest rates well the opposite would happen okay so this is a one-year chart of the Fed Funds target rate and clearly the 50 basis point rate cut from just a few days ago well that was not only bigger than all the other cuts this year,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0,but it was also a bit of a surprise from a timing perspective and impressively the stock market was down almost 800 points on the day that they announced this rate cut despite the fact that generally speaking interest rate cuts are designed to spur the economy higher now the reasons behind this particular rate cut are slightly less important for the case of this video instead let's focus on how this rate cut is intended to help the economy ok now first and probably most obvious is that inch lower interest rates affect the cost of borrowing money makes money easier to borrow for people and businesses so if we're considering buying a house well maybe lower interest rates are exactly what we need for us to buy today because lower interest rates would mean a lower mortgage and a lower cost of borrowing in general same thing if we're going to buy a car or any really big purchase sometimes lower interest rates can help sway individuals that were perhaps on the fence before and the same can be said for businesses if bennet if businesses are looking to expand their business or upgrade equipment or maybe make a new acquisition or possibly expand into a new market well sometimes lower interest rates can give them access to the capital that they need to do those things or perhaps the financing necessary to buy new machines whatever it might be and in theory those actions today help spur the economy forward since more people and more businesses are spending more money and this is often a very popular technique if an economy is in a recession it's a very popular technique to turn the economy out of the recession it's a good way to start getting more people and companies to spend again and in theory that should lead them out of a recession or in the case of today's economy hopefully prevent a recession or at least keep it further away than it is right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0,okay so that's simple enough but now there's another effect we should consider so many investors are global investors and when interest rates fall in the United States well global investors and it doesn't really matter where they live well now they have the choice do they invest in the US which is dollar denominated investments or maybe the investment that maybe they decide to invest in something that's tied to the Euro or the one or whatever it is point being that lower interest rates can often lead to a lower currency value to illustrate that this is a five-year chart of dxy which is the dollar index or one of the dollar indexes and the ten-year Treasury and roughly speaking we can see that oftentimes when interest rates go down or the dollar goes down when interest rates go up the dollar goes up,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0,and we can see that this relationship doesn't completely hold true all the times and that's largely due to the fact that a currencies value is relative to other currencies so other central banks and other countries interest rates play a role in this as well but roughly speaking a common reaction to lower interest rates is a weaker currency,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0,so that's something we should be aware of our next question is what performs well with a weaker US dollar well oftentimes gold is a strong beneficiary of a weaker dollar to illustrate let's jump back to the Great Recession and here we can see that during the Great Recession when the dollar dropped well the US well goals of the US dollar would drop and gold would rise now again it didn't always work this way in fact the International Monetary Fund you might hear called the IMF well they estimate that about 1/2 of the movement of the price of gold can be explained by the movement in the u.s. dollar so perhaps gold is a good hedge as rates as interest rates are dropping and also as investors are fearing a pending recession or a further stock market crash gold could be a good one to offset it this seems to be well positioned at this particular time now another thing that's happening as a result of falling interest rates is that bond prices move higher so we know that over the past year the Fed Funds rate has been falling,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0,but then we switch this to TLT which tracks US Treasuries that have a maturity of more than 20 years I believe and we could see that that price the price of that of those bonds has consistently risen and then if we switch from Treasuries over to triple-a corporate bonds well we can see the triple-a corporate bonds are once again doing the very same thing and this makes sense if we think about it since interest rates are falling while bond prices would be rising since the two are inversely related so as interest rates go one way bond prices will go the other way,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0,well then perhaps we should allocate more of our capital towards bonds particularly some of the more secure bonds now maybe we have no idea which way interest rates are going to go not many people do but one thing we can do is watch inflation since often lower interest rates and the subsequent pick up in the economy can lead to higher inflation higher inflation can lead to trouble for the economy and the Federal Reserve will usually jump in and start increasing rates to try to get inflation under control and the whole thing sort of swings in that that way over the long run so if we're curious this is what inflation has looked like since the year 2000 and right now it's sitting at about two-and-a-half percent which is a little bit on the high end,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0,but it's not that high now that's also as of the end of January February numbers come out in the next week or two so two and a half percent CPI just so we're all in the same page what a two and a half percent CPI tells us is that as of the end of January products broadly speaking are two and a half percent higher than they were one year ago so if inflation were to start moving higher in a meaningful way call it three three and a half four percent well it's possible that the Federal Reserve jumps in and tries to slow down the rise of inflation by spinning interest rates the other way and move them higher now if on the flip side they stay low well like we said investments like gold or bond bonds could look good so I think for now I think it makes sense for us to stay a bit more defensive,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0,and then this brings us to stocks so broadly speaking lower interest rates should imply a lower required rate of return I've discussed that in some recent videos but that's not the only reason why interest rates should do better for the economy for for at least for the stock market because of the whole spurn spending that I mentioned a few moments ago well that spurn spending is likely to lead to higher revenue for companies higher profit margins for companies and overall the stock market should continue to move higher now I would caution us from not overreacting to any one day or one month or one quarter or one piece of news a good example of that is the start of this video I said I was surprised at the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points and I was surprised as stock market was down that day that's a good example of what not to do that's way too short-sighted what I think makes the most sense is for us to make adjustments to our investment portfolios based on the big picture trends that we're seeing it seems to me that what the Federal Reserve is doing is they're trying to kick the can down the road and because of that the stock market could resume higher over the next year or two and that being said I think it could make a lot of sense to stay invested in the stock market now about a year ago I did a video called can the stock market keep moving higher and I referenced Warren Buffett saying that he thought that stocks could keep going up and that was very much at that time tied to falling interest rates and once again we're in a very similar position except this time they're falling even faster than they were originally expected to back then,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
24-j8QrbHv0,so if you're curious that could be a good next video for you to watch if you're curious about how far interest rates can go about affecting stocks there's a link right here in this link in the scription below and I really want to thank you for sticking with me all the way to the video I really appreciate it thanks and I'll see in the next video,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ds3voY0SOLw, [Music] investors are always looking for the financial santa claus and they frequently uh find someone who looks very much like santa claus but in the fullness of time it turns out that the person you were really looking at was homer simpson and santa when you're a systematic investor your process makes the decision so the decisions are made by your models that you design and you follow the process and my personal experience with this trading managed future strategies it's usually when i'm the most uncomfortable and the most concerned and my stomach hurts a little bit about the markets when the opportunities are often the best if low interest rates help the stock market in as an aggregate why on earth is europe priced at half our multiples why is japan priced at two-thirds our multiples why was the u.s stock market in the 1950s on average priced at one-third today's multiples so low interest rates aren't the aren't the panacea for stock market valuations people think i worry i don't predict a market crash i just predict um depressingly anemic stock market returns for the 2020s small cap value dramatically outperforms coming out of a recession,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ds3voY0SOLw,so if you buy small cap value in a recession your odds of the small cap premium or the value premium or both working go up dramatically right there's academic research that says actually those factors are 8x more predictable types of crisis if people want to buy some drinks if they want to follow along with what y'all are up to what's the best places to go uh so if you go to uglydrinks.com i've correct we've created a special code for listeners so it's ugly meb uh all in caps uply meb it will give you 20 off if you're in the uk or us on everything right and i just thought well the system has done the short of all time so i figured i would tweet out that hey this is going to turn out to be a disaster and there's you should own this thing because you're going to get it on the upside and so it was a pretty simple thing and so and so we bought it and i would love to tell you that i sold it at 355 [Laughter],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ds3voY0SOLw,but you would know that i would be lying because you know there's no way i could hold it to 355. so we didn't sell it but but we made a very good multiple on our money on this and to me it was just that it was an easy risk award all right now let's think about how are we gonna get that money to uh to those people and you're gonna love this mav you know how they're getting them they somebody built a portal for the irs to administer this you know who it was into it oh god ah i gotta be making my palms sweat over here oh my lord um man um you know valuations they do matter they do matter right and and of course you know a richly valued company a country or company can can get increasingly richer and more overvalued right and again it's that that idea of it's easier to know what's going to happen and when it's going to happen,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ds3voY0SOLw,but you know that when you buy that really expensive company or that really expensive country right most likely your odds aren't that good and when you buy that really cheap thing most likely your odds are pretty good and that's kind of the evolution or what's happened to data you know within the the hedge fund world the quants got it right the quantitative guys have done very well the discretionary guys not so much uh a year ago in our investor letter we said that bitcoin was born in a financial crisis and it was going to come of age in this one and i really think that's a great way to think about it that satoshi created bitcoin as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis and it's really coming into its own now in this new version of that i always joke that um you know some women like to buy shoes and i love to buy options so you gotta do what you love i feel like the argument usually goes like this right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ds3voY0SOLw,so if you can get a firm to admit that hey private equity in general has underperformed just a broad base equity investment and um i feel like the response almost always is yeah but there's persistence here and so you have to invest in top quartile if you're not on the top quartile yeah obviously it's just going to be like the s p or worse but clearly we're going to be top quartile does that argument hold any water um because i hear it all the time yeah so do i and it's it's sort of like an urban myth sort of like the tooth fairy so if you have a belief in the tooth fairy you're going to believe what you just you know what you your the argument you just stated we are incredibly excited about solana so solana is a new layer one blockchain it's fast it's cheap um and it just you can do things on solano that you can't do on other blockchains like ethereum we said to them you know,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ds3voY0SOLw,no don't i don't know if you have a cash flow problem right now but don't sell this horse this is really something and we got to the point we said sell your house don't sell this horse and that guy somehow that got hurt and it became it was the quote of the day in the new york times friday in june it was june 5th the day before the horse won the triple crown and they had an article front page center about this guy he was a passionate guy he was a big gambler and uh so anyway that's that story sell your say your house don't sell the source so again i mean and the interesting part is um you guys actually had to buy it back right i mean it was yeah yeah you had to buy it back it was in the auction at that point but he bought it back for three hundred thousand dollars so he had to pay the what the commission the five percent or something um you know so the listeners who aren't familiar with horse racing triple crown,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
Ds3voY0SOLw,and this is the first winner and how long it's been 37 years if you're thinking about valuations over a short time frame you're likely going to be disappointed um in using them as a you know sort of the your benchmark for how asset classes should perform i think you know valuations tend to work well over a five to ten year time frame and they really only tend to work well when you're seeing valuation well in excess or well under what their you know sort of long-term strategic value should be so if you see you know equities that are two standard deviations above the long term sort of fair value that's probably a good time to sell equities over the next 10 years i published a paper years ago i talked about this like dennis rodman as an example of this in basketball you know rodman was six standard deviations better at rebounding than the average player,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
Ds3voY0SOLw,so when you put dennis rodman on a team of mediocre scorers the team's offensive efficiency went up and their wins went up even though rodman himself was not a great scorer this is what paul de podessa meant by saying you don't buy players you buy wins well the investment management industry is stuck measuring the player and not the wins they're so focused on individual asset or manager performance that they're not focused on how that manager or how that asset helps your total portfolio [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck, so the one thing the Bears have over the market and it's almost the only thing other than potentially sticky inflation or maybe this reanimation of inflation or war with China and Taiwan like somebody just donated five dollars to say how would you navigate the market if you know it's certainty hypothetically of course that we were going to have a conflict between China and Taiwan it's like there's no way you could position for something that far out and that uncertain right but it's very common for the bear thesis to look for bearish reasons and reasons to sell and reasons to short reasons to get out and reasons to not believe in America there's one that stands above all and it is right here this is the inverted yield curve this is the difference between the two-year and the 10-year Treasury and what you'll find is it's actually slipping more into inversion as of late is remarkable and it part of that is because the two-year treasury just so you can visualize how this works because I know sometimes when we hear inverted yield curve it's a little confusing uh and and maybe a little bit overwhelming,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,so what I like to do is I like to try to simplify things I do the same things uh to get you from basically zero understanding to a lot of understanding in the programs on building your wealth link down below remember next price increase is June 1st at 11 59 PM so a simple way to look about this is like this let's say the two-year treasury is at four point five percent which is approximately where it is now the 10-year treasury sitting at about 3.75 percent now ordinarily when you lock up money for a longer period of time you would expect that you would have to demand a higher interest rate but that's the opposite of what's Happening Now if you lock up your money for more time you are actually earning a lower yield than if you lock up your money for less time the reason for that is because we do still have lingering inflation and that is creating this inverted yield curve generally the stock market suffers during what's known as the re-stepening of the yield curve right now the yield curve has actually been falling which that is further inverting which potentially somewhat reiterates why the stock market is actually doing well because it's the steepening the going up of this line see over here how it shows negative 0.79 that's just the difference of these two numbers here now I rounded so my difference is about negative 0.75 the actual number is about negative 0.799 whatever the point is It's usually the rest deepening that hurts the market and a lot of folks believe that when we go back to zero and an actual normal yield curve is when we will be in a technical recession now remember we looked at the tax which was the German uh,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,basically Dao it's the top 40 companies uh top 40 Blue Chip companies in Germany and they're technically in a recession right now and their stock market is actually outperformed you're at one year highs in their stock market despite the fact that Germany just technically entered into a recession now what you could do is you could look at okay well when did we have some of this steepening of the yield curve and what did the stock market do around that time well last time we had a steepening of the yield curve was actually during the banking crisis which is interesting because some people actually call it a faux deepening they say it wasn't actually a steepening,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,yet in fact we're just going to go right back to Trend so look right here for example let's draw a line let's grab a tool here grab the line tool and what some folks are saying is that we're probably just returning to the trend if this right here was the banking crisis then none of this hump should really exist if the banking crisis is gone and we're actually probably still somewhere around these levels in where the inverted yield curve should be and that when the real reseapening comes that's when we're really going to see a world of hurt because frankly if you look at what the stock market did here which this steepening was around March 10th to March 14th the stock market laughed it off absolutely laughed it off go to the S&P500. zoom in on March 10th where we got it March 10th,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,so over here you had a what a 1.8 day to the downside one percent day to the downside and then you kind of continued if you zoom out and you look at just the year here I'll set the the scope to just this year which this year began right about where are we where we were right about here so let's set it to right there this is really what the Market's done this year you can see it's been slow and steady March right up on the S&P500. the NASDAQ gets even more extreme than this and the banking crisis was right here this little bump right here also your steepening of the yield curve so there's this idea that yeah even though we laughed that off looking back as the banking crisis sort of faded away you did have a temporary kind of a little bit of a few days there where you had some red as the yield curve was re-steepening,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,so maybe if we get the real re-steepening uh towards Q3 Q4 and some form of recession then maybe that's where you have some real pain for the stock market and to some extent there might be some reasonableness in this idea given that what's propping up like the S&P500 right now isn't much in fact and this is crazy out of the S&P500 the average return of the bottom 495 stocks zero the average return of the S&P500 is zero if you take out the top five stocks I will show that to you visually right here isn't that crazy the top five stocks Apple Microsoft Amazon and video and Google have driven the S&P500.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,the bottom 495 stocks have an average return of zero so this reiterates this sort of bearish thesis that well wait a minute wait a second if we haven't gone through the real re-steepening of the yield curve of course we haven't seen any kind of real pain in the stock market yet and consumer confidence is still extremely low which you can see depicted in this picture here the Blue Line shows you uh leading indicator of consumer confidence and the white line is your S&P500 year-over-year return generally they roughly Trend in the same direction but now we're diverging the S&P500 is skyrocketing as confidence is so low and that's because it's being driven by those five stocks so you have this this narrative that bears can form right now which says just wait the real pain is still coming confidence is too low revenues are going to fall we're going to go in an earnings recession and when we get the re-steepening of the yield curve that's when we're going to get the real pain in the stock market and just wait because that's coming in Q3 Q4 here's the problem with this the problem with this bear narrative is we don't know how high the stock market is going to go between now and that let's look at the NASDAQ for a moment so we look at the NASDAQ the nasdaq's trading for 348.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,uh let's zoom out to the week chart so we can make this a little easier we can see our Nike Swoosh recovery over here so we know that in 2020 the stock market was extremely volatile right we got all this crazy up and down mess of 2020 and we had this massive downtrend down but think about that for a moment as we had the downtrend down in 2022 what you didn't want if I said 2020 I meant 2020. uh what you didn't want was to be in the stock market basically the best move during 2022 was don't be in the stock market because it didn't matter when you had Downs it just ended up going down more the opposite seems to be true now in 2023. where it doesn't matter if we have downs we just get another leg up and so this is leading the Bulls to counter the Bears and say look yeah maybe when the yield curve steep you know steepens again we're gonna have a 10 decline in the NASDAQ but what if that means we end up going all the way up to 404,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,and then we ring the bell ding and then we dropped 10 and we're at 393 then guess what we're still up about 10 from where we are now and that's the probably that's probably the most frustrating thing to say to a bear is yeah maybe the market will go down but how much is it going to go up first and so obviously nobody knows obviously the charts right now in the week look relatively extended over here obviously we know that this whole like AI Revolution that everybody's talking about and and if you're not studying AI you're getting left behind but don't worry if you want to get caught up on AI you could join the how to make more money and get sh 19 done faster where I'm going to teach you everything uh that we've been studying about AI to get you caught up as either an entrepreneur or business owner or or really uh even employee who's trying to make more money or provide more value for a business check that out you're gonna love it price goes up June 1st,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,11 59 PM so with that said though look the Bears have a point yes usually when you enter a recession the stock market Falls and it's only as you come out of a recession that the stock market actually starts Rising again and usually when the yield curve rate steepens the stock market Falls but the question is how high do we go before that that's the big question and again I would I would really encourage you pay attention to Germany pay attention to Germany which just entered into a technical recession and what I want you to do is I want you to search Google for Dax stock market and zoom out to the max zoom out to the maximum zoom out for the Dax this is the furthest you could look out and what do you have you are nearly wait I'm sorry no you are you are at ah you were 30 points away from all-time highs all-time highs November 5 2021 16 054 we are at 16 024.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,so your 30 points on sixty thousand that's less than one percent that's like a third of one percent less probably third quarter whatever a fraction of a percent away from all-time highs and Germany's a recession I don't know it's it's whatever's going on it's weird it just does seem to be very difficult though these days to be bearish uh because we don't seem to have the Catalyst that corroborate why uh we need to continue to be embarrassed embarrassed and I think that's why you see uh so much talk like this you know anytime you turn on the news on it's debt ceiling debt ceiling and a lot of it is oh is it actually still going to go through is it is it actually still gonna uh you know happen just exhaust that's that's all it's exhausting uh and there's nothing new about it I'm tired,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
UtthZD7Ckck,anyway now I want you to know this when it comes to AI it's time is what's going to make you money and if you can prove that value to an employer you'll always be able to be employed so this is another way of making sure that you don't get replaced,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c, housing we've got a disaster reported on Twitter and while we cannot yet independently verify this it is a red flag that has a logical basis and it's very fascinating so here's an individual called Jacob at Raleigh fam Jacob says the following I'm a new home sales rep okay let me just explain that really quick because a lot of people might not understand what that means it means you're a real estate agent who stands at the open house for a home builder and you try to sell new homes okay so he's a real estate agent who's trying to sell new homes okay all right for a top five American Builder new home sale reps are a small community in other words they all talk to each other oh he literally says that we all talk to each other uh Builders are inflating the numbers,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,uh oh wait a minute Builder stocks and Builder earnings calls have actually been very good they've been bragging about how things are getting better in December and January and things are looking up and up hmm but wait a minute Builders are inflating the numbers keeping bad contracts and bad loans on the books to prevent showing cancellations uh- oh so what do we have over here he gives us a chart that shows how uh cancellations for companies are up substantially over double for our Meritage Homes you've got Pulte Home Group over here double DR Horton you've got a double uh you've got cancellation rates basically skyrocketing and you also have a substantial decline in net new orders this we've actually seen in publicly available statistics as well we know that cancellation rates have skyrocketed and we know that net new orders have fallen we already know that so that's actually not a secret so statistically we already know that some of that data is happening,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,but what's really alarming is this idea that Builders are potentially inflating the numbers so what rationale does he give for inflating the numbers and how could we potentially deduce truth from that well first of all uh what else does he say he says here unfortunately it's going to get bad okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,well that's anecdotal let's get to where some more of the Insight is for example in the past we would immediately cancel or not even write a contract slash build if we found you weren't qualified over the last three months ninety percent of what we are forced to write are unqualified contracts because the qualified buyers are gone these unqualified buyers won't be able to close so what we're seeing is all the new home sales are worthless but we have a gun to our head that if we don't hit our quota of three to six homes sold a month we will be laid off or terminated so we have to write the contracts but they won't close the base prices are too high but we can't drop the base price because the backlog under contract won't appraise so instead we are doing incentives but incentives stopped working months ago so Builders are stuck if we drop prices the already bad contracts will be even more bad okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,so let me explain this because this is very tricky if you're not from the real estate world and I'll try to explain the potential impact of this because it is concerning especially since when you look at companies like Lennar the darn stocks or I've actually recovered substantially from their loans or for from their lows last year in fact here just go to Google really quick type in Lennar stock and look at this sucker over the last year it's up 11 a year ago from a year ago you look at the last five year chart the sucker had a dip in a low in June but it's recovered 57 from June how does that potentially make sense when housing prices haven't even really shown their year-over-year fall,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,yet maybe it's the perfect short opportunity uh we'll be talking about that a lot more by the way in our trading challenge that we've got coming up we're officially launching the uh Team trading challenge for course members in the stocks and psychology money group remember of course which you can get lifetime access to by the link down below but here is how Housing Works uh when it comes to new construction builds so let's say you have a buyer who comes in on uh today okay so today is February 11th and they're like hey I want to buy Lot number 152.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,so you're gonna buy lot 152 and you're going to go under contract for let's say five hundred thousand dollars but in order to be convinced to go under contract for five hundred thousand dollars you're like well I want twenty thousand dollars of incentives now that'll buy you maybe new flooring and it'll cost the Builder seven thousand dollars to do the flooring so the Builder actually props up their margins by giving you this uh twenty thousand dollar incentive because they're conv they're giving you twenty thousand dollars of apparent value which is what you think you're getting but you're really only getting seven thousand dollars of value but that's how builders make money they want you to buy upgrades through the Builder that's where they make a lot of money but Builders are also making a lot of money because guess what the lot they built this property on they built number 152. guess when that lot was probably purchased okay and this this gets really scary are you ready for this guess when the lot was probably purchased for the house number 152 that's selling today 2019 or 2020.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,guess what real estate prices were in 2020 2019 and 2020 much lower than they are today which why is that really interesting well it means that the Builder margins are still today being propped up by low lot sales from 2019 and 2020. well lot sales in 2021 and 23 and 22 are much more expensive specifically 2021 which is what we're going to see next like the 2021 lot sales we'll actually start seeing those come up in 23 and 24 here right the 2021 lot sales are going to be extremely expensive relative to what home prices are likely to be when they actually start falling more in 23 and 24 and through the rest of really this year because we're in 2023. so this the lot prices are way higher now for the homes that are coming up but the homes that are selling today are still selling with low lot prices so it artificially makes the home builder profits look high right now,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,so the home builder profits look high right now because of a low base cost from low lot values but when those higher lot values come in you're going to have a big oopsie dupsies and those higher lot values will probably start coming in later in 2023 three so dangerous for for housing well for Builders it's going to be higher lot values uh as uh you know an input cost for Builders at the end of 2023 plus right getting rid of that cheaper previous slot inventory that is going to be a drag on the home builders towards the end of 2023 so keep that in mind okay now while you keep that in mind let's go back to what this guy on the Twitter thing said basically about we'll use our example here lot 152. what is a builder backlog well when somebody says we have a builder backlog that we want to make sure can appraise what they're actually talking about is under contract deals so the loser who bought property uh let's say 150 I don't know let's say 149 okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,so the loser who bought property 149 for 500 000 as well uh January let's say 28th their appraisal is in part going to rely on the appraisal of the new sales but it's also going to rely on the losers who bought property you know like 130 in December it'll say December 30th there we go December 30th,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,all right so if the person who bought a home in December for five hundred thousand dollars got I don't know ten thousand dollars in flooring incentives and the guy who bought the home in uh uh in in January got uh you know fifteen thousand dollars in flooring incentives and the guy who's buying the home now is getting twenty thousand dollars in incentives what you're basically doing is you're technically reducing the value of the homes without actually reducing the value of the homes so you're basically giving people money to artificially keep home values up in the new home builder areas because you're you're giving people incentives to reduce the actual price of the property without reducing the appraised value of the property see when the appraiser goes in to appraise lot 142 in this example that was sold in January the appraiser is going to go hey well what did things sell for in December 500k sir,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,well what are things selling for now 500k sir and the appraiser is like sounds good to me I guess your appraisal is five hundred thousand dollars this is no skin off appraisals it's just the way the system works that's what the banks want the banks want the appraisals now might there be some notes about incentives sure do the banks really care no so Landing could potentially be propped up by artificial artificially High appraisals because of incentives uh and and they don't have to be monetary incentives the Builder could have already gone in and upgraded the homes so in theory they don't have to give you the 20 grand they could just go hey have this home with fancier flooring and the appraiser can't really adjust for that very well because there are already new homes you're already on a condition level I think the new construction C1 it's hard to go C1 is is you know even better than like uh new construction might be C2 I'm not an appraiser,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,but basically there are these classifications and it's hard to say just because one house has slightly better flooring that all of a sudden the entire condition value of that house is so much more and you have to make an adjustment for it I'm really going to skim past this really quick,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,but I'm basically telling you a home builder can throw an extra 50 Grand into a house and it's not going to make it so much substantially different that the appraiser is actually going to be able to make any kind of difference on the valuation for that generally when you have valuations that are different because of the condition it's because somebody went through and spent you know five hundred thousand dollars on a remodel for a five million dollar home versus somebody else who spent fifty thousand dollars on a remodel on a five million dollar home right then you can get more condition adjustments for stuff that's new like in other words what I'm saying is for like the the 99 sent new flooring to actually make a difference compared to the seven dollar new flooring everything in the home needs to be built to a substantially better degree for it to actually make a difference in the appraisals and so the point of saying that is that home builders can artificially keep home values High by just putting in slightly better flooring and the appraiser is not actually making a negative adjustment for that in other words in two months from now you could still sell a home for 500k and you could potentially put forty thousand dollars worth of upgrades into it and the appraiser is not making an adjustment for it the bear is like well it looks like we're still 500k that's called dealing with your backlog that's making sure your next homes that are being sold aren't ruining your prior appraisals that's what this individual on Twitter is saying and the individual here is making this argument that people might not be able to qualify for these homes but we're writing the contracts anyway because we basically want to inflate the numbers because we don't want to lose our job so the builders are like you guys need to sell these homes do whatever you got to do to sell the homes or else you're fired and the sales reps are like dude like nobody's coming in to buy these homes even because we're giving them incentives and this is where it becomes concerning and the the sales reps are like whatever we'll just write the contract anyway and send it to the Builder the Builder just cares about getting contracts so the sales rep writes the contract sends it to the Builder the Builder's like okay got a contract all right,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,somebody's willing to pay 500k great sounds great hey appraiser by the way we got another contract for 50k we're doing good when the reality is if that person doesn't close eventually the cards fall eventually those deals contract fall through and cancel and when those deals fall through and cancel what happens inventory goes up and that's the biggest concern that you have for Real Estate is an increase in inventory so increasing inventory probably doesn't come from resale homes because people have locked in low interest rates right it probably actually comes from new construction home builders who are resistant to large-scale price reductions in the face of higher rates and what have rates been doing recently rates have jumped they came down a little bit in December and January but they've jumped right back to nearly uh we're we're on on the path back to nearly the highs that we had in October November uh not quite there yet we are there on the two-year but mortgage rates generally follow the 10-year treasury yield and the 10-year treasury is sitting at 37.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,we went down to like three three uh just a little bit ago and we were trending down but now we're trending up so with rates jumping and this potential inventory surge coming from new construction at the same time as you get year-over-year pain in real estate you've got the and and you have Reit liquidations because people want their money out of rates you got some potential issues now the year-over-year numbers are important to look at we can actually look at some of the year-over-year numbers by looking at the Redfin Data Center and it's really simple that we're going to end up a Crossing these year over year numbers which actually finally start creating fear in the real estate market that oh my Lord home prices are actually coming down because right now if you look at year over year prices a year ago we're actually still higher than where we were last year uh nominally see take a look at this home prices right now national average sitting at 347. well that's about one percent higher than where we were last year in January and what happens if we stay at 347 and all,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,of a sudden we get to say March and we compare to 374. well 374 year over year uh now became 347. you're down 7.3 percent now all of a sudden people start getting nervous and then what happens when we get to May or June or July we're actually comparing 347 assuming housing prices don't fall anymore compared to 388 on a national average home prices are now down over 10 percent and that's not even going into some markets where things are getting ugly uh like oh ooh Boise is a good one you go to like for example Boise Idaho what do you have over here look at that housing prices are falling even more every single week so you're looking at 444 divided by uh 547 when you get to that comparison you're down almost 19 percent,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,so you do have some serious issues Coming For Real Estate so the dangers for housing are these higher lot values which are going to kill margins for Builders in addition to cancellations at Builders I think that potentially combined with high values for Builder stocks actually creates a really good short opportunity uh for Builders potentially you know I'm not telling you it's a guarantee it's certainly not personalized Financial advice for your portfolio but anyway there's a huge danger for Builders and Builder stocks there's a very big risk of increasing inventory lowering prices not because homeowners are selling but because of rate liquidations and Builders but then when you get the year-over-year fear combined with rates jumping you have even more of a problem in my opinion in order to actually prevent a more substantial housing burden or crash you need to see the 10-year treasure yield get below 2.75,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
eBWJwQG-J4c,I've been pounding my faces on the table for over a year now saying the more the 10-year treasury year yield is over 2.75 the more pain you're going to get for longer and it's been pretty volatile over here you can see on this chart uh that the chart is unfortunately trending up again now hopefully that stops maybe the CPI report comes in low and the high jobs report end up everything leads to disinflation great then you put a floor under the housing market you get your 15 to 25 correction as I've been talking about for a year on this channel I've been talking about this since January of 2022 this 15 to 25 correction coming people called me in you know crazy now we've already seen 15 to 20 declines and there's the potential of even more declines but I hate to say it this guy's tweet uh Jacob uh this is bad because really what you're suggesting is that home builder stocks are rallying under uh false pretenses that that really home builders unintentionally just because home sales reps don't want to lose their jobs you're basically having inadvertent fraud happening to prop up uh sales for people who are buying homes with appraisals that are based on how's this actually selling for what somebody is in escrow for you know next down the line that's the backlog appraise under false pretenses that somebody's actually uh uh you know buying a home after someone else at the similar valuation that's scary so you get some real real issues happening in the new construction space and I would be very cautious and I'm potentially considering opening up shorts on uh on some of the home builders that I choose I'll be posting all of the alerts for that uh coming up probably this week here in the stocks and psychology money group so stay tuned for that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fRdsJnr10xU, Michael burry has made a massive shift Warren Buffett has added a brand new position one that we've analyzed in our course member live stream uh just two weeks ago and boy do I have some opinions on this position Federal Reserve expectations earnings from Walmart Home Depot and monday.com are things we've got to talk about and an in crazy A crazy crazy crazy inflationary shocker that just came out this morning let's talk about all of this as well as a quick little update on scumbags Sam bankman freed folks remember 60 off coupon code linked down below new lectures coming out in December and they're going to be amazing for everything the real estate course stocks course Property Management course even the YouTube course we'll have new lectures coming out in December with all of the elite Hustler lectures with no monthly fee now I listen to your advice no monthly fee for the elite Hustler scores coming out on Black Friday so use that 60 off Black Friday coupon code so what are the updates same bankman freed big scumbag,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

fRdsJnr10xU,dang it means that a lot of people are pricing in paying for markets Federal Reserve pricing is still sitting at an expectation that the FED will hike to five percent and will likely hold at five percent all year long most major banks are sitting between a uh four to five percent terminal rate expectation with Wells Fargo Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg coming in between five and five and a quarter percent JPMorgan 475 Morgan Stanley four five Barclays four five and Deutsche Bank four percent now remember if those numbers those estimates get moved down markets go up if those estimates move up markets move down it's very simple in case you're wondering why the S&P500 moves everything has to do with expectations for the Federal Reserve now before we talk about Warren Buffett and Michael burry's crazy shift I want to touch on some earnings really quick Walmart finally only grew inventories at 12 percent they're finally getting a handle on inventories transactions up remember we don't look at sales anymore sales is a stupid number because when they're like oh sales are up eight percent we're like Oh yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fRdsJnr10xU,duh inflation's up eight percent so your real growth is zero so uh transactions actually up at Walmart especially the grocery division so that that's a two two point one percent excuse me increase here their ad business up thirty percent so actually growing decently on their ad business which I don't actually know that much about their ad business which is kind of fascinating because it is a newer aspect to their business but most advertising businesses are actually suffering and declining right now on growth although trade desk actually surprised and did pretty dang decently relative to how others are doing trade desk and their CEO which is by the way located in my hometown Ventura California they actually argue that during these recessionary times they think they'll be able to take more market share than some of the more traditional forms of advertising uh like Google or Facebook I don't know if that's true,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fRdsJnr10xU,but that's what they argue so a lot more people apparently going to Walmart and when you get those middle to Upper end consumers shifting down to Walmart they can oftentimes be a little sticky in in staying with Walmart as far as Home Depot Home Depot did not fare as well Home Depot saw transactions that decline quarter over quarter and gave a little bit of a weaker guide there is a little bit of a sign that we're still seeing people spend at Home Depot because as they wrap up projects I'm really wishing I can get some details on how many people are spending or how much money is being spent on things like moldings and paint which are considered finished jobs in construction compared to two by fours which are generally your raw material sort of beginning of projects uh tasks should I say or purchases I'd love to get some detail on that but the earnings calls going on right now so we don't have that yet but pay attention to that we are seeing lower guide though and inventory to sales spreads and narrowing suggesting slower or slipping orders and weaker demand in the future monday.com saw an inflection point in their customer Resource Management sales in September and October and mentioned that what used to just be European stress is now starting to become Global stress we're seeing this from a lot of companies a lot of companies are telling us that,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fRdsJnr10xU,oh yeah all of a sudden in September and October we started hating a wall this doesn't really surprise me because we're finally actually seeing the impact of the federal reserve's tightening and it really aligns with the layoffs we're seeing especially the corporate layoffs at Amazon remember these are not seasonal layoffs we're actually seeing programmer layoffs corporate layoffs of the Alexa divisions getting hit hard I think they might actually end up closing that entire division down apparently just not profitable to do a voice yet sorry garyvee Federal Reserve we already talked about Federal Reserve expectations hedge funds okay we have a lot of hedge funds actually cutting Tesla D1 cut at stake by 48 Catal cut by 16 and a 48 cut is pretty large uh one of the things to know is that Tesla has also slashed its orders uh Elite its order lead times to just one week now I think the mainstream media is going to jump on this and go,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
fRdsJnr10xU,oh my gosh this is bad Tesla Lead times only one week look Tesla demand plummeting I actually think the opposite is going to happen of course I'm a Tesla bull so take what I say with a grain of salt I always like to be aware of my biases uh and and of course the biggest bias that I have is uh suggesting that you should check out those courses because nobody nobody works harder than I do and nobody is going to provide you more value in those courses if you don't see something that you expect to be in those courses you make sure you write me a message in Discord you tag me and that lecture will be there by the end of the year that's just what I'm doing I'm gonna keep making videos because I love y'all and if it ain't there you tag me in Discord I'm gonna go through it all by the end of this year and we're gonna have more lectures we're using that Blackboard until that Blackboard breaks,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
fRdsJnr10xU,but anyway I think the mainstream media is going to go oh this is bad you know demand down I actually think it's going to be free advertising because everybody's gonna go what I only have to wait a week to get a Tesla this is great news now obviously there's a risk that demand does collapse if demand collapses Tesla stock will collapse sorry and sorry me if demand does not collapse which I think a demand collapsing is like a 15 risk if demand does not collapse uh then I think Tesla surges especially once the Twitter drama settles down I think there's an 85 chance of that okay now let's talk about Warren buff and Michael burry Michael burry out of shorts he's going heavy on private prisons increasing his bets on the Geo Group uh core Civic both private prisons and a curate retail private prison he's also ditched Facebook and Google interesting that he ditched Google I mean Facebook I don't blame him for I think that's a stupid bet on the metaverse but anyway uh okay my take on private prisons look,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0

fRdsJnr10xU,but then I'm like ah but if prices go up 20 for lithium it really only costs maybe 80 bucks more for a battery now I mean that's still something but uh it's it's not as big of a component as I thought it was for uh Tesla which is good news there Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett adds a bit more Chevron up to stake 23 on Occidental and decreased his Activision bet by 12 remember his Activision bet is a bet that Activision will be acquired I think it's for like in the 90 or some something like that it's an Arbitrage bat Viking adds to Salesforce and Michael burry I think I already mentioned has no shorts that sounds weird anyway uh okay now now now now we got to talk about the inflationary numbers okay so we had really good CPI numbers right so what came after these really good CPI numbers well today producer price number so CPI is from the consumer's perspective producer is from the seller's perspective okay,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

VxbEF_xhkz4,and I have some opinions on this first of all and it's always touchy okay I'm just blunt on the channel it's always touchy if you're a single mom you're in a very difficult position if you have not yet really figured out how to make more money than 16.50 uh cents an hour by the time you have a child that's probably the first mistake here now I know that mistake is in the past I'm not going to spend most of the time on this but let's make it very clear if you were a woman the best case scenario is before you have a child make more money than 16.50 an hour that's probably priority number one is make sure you're not reliant on anyone else whether that's a man another woman,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VxbEF_xhkz4,Mom Dad I don't care who it is make sure you're self-reliant yourself before you have a child that is Mission critical number one do not rely on anyone else the government or anyone that is number one number two if you're making sixteen dollars and fifty cents an hour at Chase in Irvine you're probably not getting the most income that you could you're probably able like this in the snap of a finger able to go from 16.50 an hour to potentially 40 or 50 percent more pay working for Amazon making 22 to 24 dollars an hour with no necessary additional skill set than what you already have at JP Morgan so in this scenario you're really putting somebody in a very expensive area in Southern California who has a six-year-old child and they're already not getting potentially the best job available to them with no additional education or training now the next thing that this individual should do is they have to realize if your paycheck to paycheck are potentially negative in this scenario when they went through sort of a budget the person's negative 500 a month for a basic costs like uh you know essentially housing food child care whatever somebody like this in this situation who has gotten them in a place where they have a six-year-old child and they're only able to make 16 to maybe twenty four dollars an hour they're going to have to work more than eight hours a day and of course this is not even including the fact that they have a child to take care of,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

VxbEF_xhkz4,but that's not necessarily going to get you ahead that might just sink you back into essentially just compressing yourself into more of an area of poverty and when poverty concentrates you end up getting worse schooling for your child and that's not what you want to set your child up for you want to set yourself and your child up for the best odds of success so one of the best things this individual could do is start looking into home education programs where they can maybe learn how to get a Nursing degree working before they go to work in the morning or when their child's asleep at night that should be the priority in fact a lot of nursing school programs only require you go to school actually in person once to twice a week now because so much can be done at home at your own pace now all of a sudden you could potentially go from not just making 16.50 an hour or even 22 23 24 an hour working at let's say Amazon,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VxbEF_xhkz4,but you could actually go to making 50 dollars an hour when you actually get a professional certification like becoming a registered nurse so when Katie Porter asks one of the richest people in the world hey how can a person making 16.50 at your bank actually get ahead,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
VxbEF_xhkz4,she's actually not asking the right question it is not Jamie Diamond's responsibility to offer a job that creates value of potentially even less than 16.50 for the bank to somebody that can cover all of their expenses when they set themselves up and put themselves unfortunately into a situation that is not not conducive with actually being able to survive in America whether it's the location they're in or the decisions they made prior to getting into that situation but it is now incumbent upon that person themselves to get themselves out of that situation now some people say hey that's not fair and look that is the capitalistic structure that America is based off of now fortunately and this is the fortunate part fortunately even though we are a country of capitalistic rules and ideals we do have a social safety net and this is the next thing that the individual should consider somebody on this sort of income would easily especially in Southern California qualify for Section 8 subsidized housing which means they could potentially get almost all of their rent covered now they have more money to make sure they can educate themselves rather than paying sixteen hundred dollars a month in rent maybe they could pay a thousand dollars less a month in rent and only pay about 600 a month in rent now there are waiting lists for Section 8,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

VxbEF_xhkz4,hey what can I do to get my education subsidized by going to local community colleges or universities and seeing if they have any programs for people in my situation and the odds are they do so almost every single objection that exists can be overcome by a solution in America and we haven't even talked about the fact that you could also get Medicaid uh when your income is below a certain level within a region especially in Irvine you're certainly within a percentage of the level of poverty in fact I would argue you're below the poverty line uh for a two-person household so there are so many important things to consider when it comes to America that I understand that when we take this one person 16.50 income with a child out of context we realize there are a lot of things that happen or we have to realize there are a lot of problems that happen before and then there are now problems that are happening today in this sort of fictitious example but that fictitious example is probably real and it does happen it's not going to be easy to get out of that hole but the good news is it's possible so that's my take on Katie Porter's video probably not going to be the most popular but then again I'm coming at it from the angle of uh somebody in in the uh in the finance space and thinking myself well if Jamie Diamond doesn't want to give answers because it would be unpopular to say well leave Chase,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

yhjC79Cb5Rs,but you've you've got some concerns that maybe markets are a little bit frothy and maybe supply chain issues are going to last a lot longer than we expect and who knows maybe even jerome powell's uh re nomination could potentially stoke fears of inflation again but anyway so visa's payment processing uh visa just in general here has really gone from a high of about 256 here recently to uh to about 198 which for visa for a large company like this to drop all of a sudden about 22 percent is pretty remarkable but you're also seeing that at a company like paypal look at this paypal is sitting at 185 folks 185 divided by 310 you're down 40 percent from the high and you're actually seeing today the fintech space the fi all of it really on fire like melting look at robin hood all-time lows 27 45 and no signs of this fall stopping redfin 42 it's going straight down which is also in the real estate space and this is despite i mean i suppose you could say somewhat exposed to financials uh i,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,i'm not exactly sure the correlation potentially between redfin and financials here so maybe i'll just shelf that and just stop talking about it but anyway look at some of the other financials first of all i bagged on insurtech this weekend but don't blame me for causing this sell-off i mean hippo insurance is down 10 uh you've got mq the credit card uh processing company here down 9.8 percent you've got backed holdings another fintech here down 12 and it's already at the bottom of its sort of momentum curve here a firm down 11 here software companies like cloudflare down 10 today a square down at 207 dollars i mean look at square's chart here we're about to hit may lows i mean we are at may lows right now uh well again main lows were about 192.,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,we're almost at may lows so far way back down look at this we broke right past that 19-ish support level broke straight through that uh and there's no sign of this downtrend stopping down seven point seven nine percent you've even got the miners selling off here look at this matter port this morning this is actually a little surprising uh i uh i actually sold a bunch of mad report this morning that report this morning was up like six percent now it's down six percent i mean that's a twelve percent u-turn holy moly uh lemonade insurance down five point three percent these are uh etsy etsy was up this morning we were almost at three and look at that we hit and one dollar for etsy and and now it's that was up like five or six percent now it's down five percent there's been a massive u-turn of sentiment here in the market and it's mostly starting with financials right now fintech and payment processors and insure tech brokerages they are getting destroyed and wrecked at the same time people are drawing more money out of the S&P500 than we've ever seen since april,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,so it's no surprise that we're starting to see some of these lows come back right now we are still seeing somewhat of uh enthusiasm in electric vehicles and uh and charging companies but in solar companies but honestly i have to say solar edge was green today but i don't see it in the green anymore yeah look at that solar edge is down now so all of a sudden you're starting to see a little bit of a drawdown in solar this could just be a temporary movement here but you know in my opinion it uh it's a little bit of a of a red flag warning sign the market could finally be saying you know what we're getting to the end of the year it's time to potentially take some profits and and recognize some gains and set some money aside to potentially buy the dip now don't get me wrong,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,i'm still very very long on this market but uh i did i did do some selling this morning uh i will go through some of my cells uh all of them are obviously always posted and and i talk about my theses in the stocks and psychology of money group uh in our live streams all the time remember folks if you join the programs you get lifetime access so there's a coupon code that expires on friday uh you may as well just join now it's not going to be any cheaper between now and friday 11 59 pm the price is going to go up after that and last thing you want to do is wake up saturday morning oh crap i forgot consider it check it out look at the bundle options,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,as well it's the best price you're going to get for the black friday sale here and uh let me go through some of the sales that i did this morning which every time i post to sell uh whether it's a buy it's a sell i try to include a little bit of a thesis as to what i'm doing why i'm doing it and uh and my intentions is it a trade is it long term what am i doing why am i doing it and it's every single time like i don't pick and choose like if i make a trade and it turns out to be a loser it's embarrassing but i'm transparent so uh okay i closed some of the sold puts that i had on amc just to take a little bit of to raise that cash and limit the potential of me having to use that cash i still have my long position in amc i sold a thousand etsy uh let's see etsy etsy i didn't time it all the way perfectly at the top and i still have a lot of etsy so don't get me wrong,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,but uh i did sell etsy we uh sold etsy at a thousand shares of etsy sold ten thousand shares of matterport uh both of these higher than where it is now at the time of this recording neo i sold out of some options some call options that i had on neo one of them was profitable by about uh 20 30 000 one of them was down about 6k so i really used it to free up cash like for example uh even though i was up thirty thousand dollars in one i was down six thousand another here but it would unlock a hundred and five thousand dollars of market value uh selling it so here i can actually show you that screenshot right here here's that screenshot of that that neo option that was down is down 6k you know it's up almost 16 000 on the day because neo had a pretty pretty nice rally day here but i'm now freeing up uh 105 000 of cash and,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,and so i'm willing to do that especially since i'm washing it out with with some of the the other gains that i have uh so uh then we've got uh some other sales that i made i'm not gonna go through all of them close some other options some other positions some smaller positions i did though get it remember i got a signed tesla shares i get assigned a bunch of tesla uh let me go ahead and show you tesla tesla uh here it is okay let's go ahead and pull that up here okay so i got a signed uh tesla shares because i bought tesla shares uh i bought a thousand tesla shares because i sold a put and then tesla fell because thanks to elon musk and i was able to break even on that assignment which really worked out because i didn't really want more exposure to tesla but i sold a put i got a credit i sold the put for 1225 you can see that there at the bottom 1225 10 contracts so worth about 1.2 million dollars uh then of course elon musk started selling i got a signed uh,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,so i was net net in for about uh 1177 which you could see on uh if uh let's see here there we go on the right side there average price 11.77 the screenshot's showing up a little funky let me try to show this a little differently there we go if i do this i think yeah that's much better okay so uh i got a signed so basically i sold a put promising somebody had paid 12.25 i was doing weekly sold puts because tesla was basically on this euphoric rally and it would have continued had it not been for elon musk selling shares so whatever i made money doing some uh some of these before and i i was just milk and premium it was great and i was willing to buy extra tesla shares but i didn't really want extra 10 000 or an extra 1000 tesla shares but anyway so i got a signed 12.25 my net cost was 11.77 tesla fell to like 980 i'm like whatever i guess i'm diamond handing these shares which is fine because i've got a massive long position on tesla,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,but today tesla rallied up another like four or five percent so as soon as it went profitable these shares it was up about eighty six hundred dollars i'm like yup cha-ching i'm gonna ring the bell on that take some profits and so even though i ended up getting assigned to put i held on until uh until that one broke uh slightly positive and uh interestingly tesla's have been on a little bit of a roller coaster today so uh tesla is sitting right now uh at uh about uh let's see i sold this at about when tesla was sitting at uh 1180 tesla right now sitting at a little bit of a roller coaster uh tesla bouncing up from its lows earlier take a look at this tesla did fall to about 11 32 i sold right around 1180 a lot it was somewhere around here when did i make that transaction 8 23 am 8 23 am here you go so tesla was at about 11 85 when i closed that position so you could see it it fell substantially more after that it's recovered fine it's volatile i don't really care,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,i diamond hand my long position on that but for my trade position i'm glad i was able to uh rotate out of that free up some cash and so that's where a bulk of the cash the trading cash was that i was able to free up so this is where i am now i'm at about 16 cash i'm probably not going to go more than 20 cash but i'm definitely definitely looking for opportunities and probably what i'm looking for in this market right now is either a continued sell-off in fintech which we may or may not get you're getting a little bit of a recovery right now in a firm it fell to 118. i've been watching it recover here we could get a recovery i've still got a long position in a firm and at cnn phase my 85 of my portfolio i'm not touching but i am interested in watching to see if this trend continues if this trend continues i will buy the dip but i'm not ready to buy the dip yet because i worry that the sectoral trend potentially is just the beginning,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,so i don't know yet if if we've hit a bottom i know intraday obviously we did in the firm bottom at 118 but this is going to be a trend that i'm going to watch and i want to see if this fintech sell-off ends up spilling over to energy so far there's still a lot of enthusiasm and energy and evs lots of that also looking for potential sell-off in nvidia but i've got a cash position i'll either use it for a larger and substantial dip and when i see that dip obviously i'm going to be sending alerts in the stocks psychology money group that here it is this is this is where i think i'm happy buying the dip and in my opinion that's a way of trying to build your portfolio to get outsized returns when you're really going in heavy when something has sold off and so i'm looking for that opportunity i don't think we're just there yet it could be wrong and if i'm wrong that we're not at a bottom yet then then i'm 85 percent long,overall_long_video_data.csv,1.0
yhjC79Cb5Rs,and it's okay if uh if if we end up going to lower levels obviously the long positions won't be very happy but that's okay i don't want to pay too many taxes on all those long positions so we're just going to keep those diamond hand those but i'm going to use this new cash pile that i've been able to generate through taking profits or trimming positions that that i'm not as enthusiastic about going into the end of the year here and i'll wait for some catalyst whether it's congress uh it's drama over the bipartisan or not the bipartisan infrastructure package that's done the buildback better plan uh the debt ceiling the government shutdown whatever i expect we'll get through all that just fine but if we can get some drama that happens over the holidays over the next few weeks here hey i'm ready by the dip i'm excited so we'll see what happens folks thank you so much for watching this video if you found it helpful consider sharing it and we'll see in the next one thanks again goodbye [Music],overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs, what's up guys it's Graham here so the other day I came across an article which found that 60 of Americans are currently living paycheck to paycheck and that got me thinking what is the average net worth throughout every age and is that realistically enough to be able to one day buy a house raise a family or even retire not to mention I was surprised to see just how big of a difference there was between the average and the top one percent throughout your 20s 30s and 40s so I promise if you watch all the way through you're going to know exactly where you stand how much net worth you should have by every age my own recommendations to make sure you stay on track,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,and then what you could do about all of this if you find yourself falling behind although before we start did you know that over 90 percent of YouTube viewers do not hit the like button and subscribe that's right if you immediately want to stand out from the rest make sure to smash it for the YouTube algorithm and as a thank you I promise to share everything I know about personal finance so with that said thank you so much and now let's begin alright,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,so first it's important to understand how to properly calculate your net worth because despite what most people think it has nothing to do with how much money you make but instead how much you save for instance I've met people making five hundred thousand dollars a year who have absolutely nothing to show for it While others have a million dollars saved up on a salary of fifty thousand dollars so if you want to calculate your net worth it's pretty simple this just refers to your assets minus liabilities or I guess more simply put out of the value of everything that you own and then subtract what you owe and what's left over is your net worth as an example let's just say you have a three hundred thousand dollar house drive a twenty thousand dollar car have thirty thousand dollars in your retirement account and hold ten thousand dollars in cash this means you have three hundred and sixty thousand dollars worth of assets however your net worth would subtract the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage the fifteen thousand dollar auto loan and the five thousand dollars in credit card debt leaving you with a ninety thousand dollar net worth so now that you know exactly which number we're looking for here's the average net worth throughout every age,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,oh and by the way before we start I just want to forewarn you that there is a big difference between the average the median and the top one percent let me explain anytime you look at the average it's typically skewed by a few people who make a lot of money like if you took the average net worth of 10 random people and Elon Musk was one of them the average number would be somewhere in the tens of billions despite the other nine people probably being worth closer to zero so for that reason I think it's also important that we include the median net worth which is the perfect middle point of someone's finances that way you'll not only see how much you stack against the high earners but also how you stack up against the majority of your peers and it all starts here according to the Federal Reserve Consumer Finance survey the average net worth those between the ages of 18 and 24 is twenty eight thousand seven hundred and seven dollars and Thirteen Cents,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,but before you get discouraged just remember that this number is pulled up significantly by a few people who make a lot of money like The Stranger Things cast to earn an estimated nine and a half million dollar paycheck or the top one percent in this age who have a net worth of 435 thousand dollars because of that the median net worth in this age bracket is 8 216 dollars likely because most people of this age are either still in school just beginning their career or just starting to save not to mention if you went to college the average student loan debt is 37 574 dollars so it wouldn't even be uncommon at this age to have a negative net worth simply because you had very little to begin with that's why if you want to put yourself ahead and make sure you're on track to doing everything you want to do throughout your 30s and 40s here's what I recommend first go and get yourself a credit card with no annual fee the point of this is to begin building your credit history and since 50 percent of that score is based on your on-time payment history and how long you've had the card open for the sooner you start on this the better second make sure you open up a Roth IRA or contribute to a 401k these are both tax advantaged accounts that you would be able to set up yourself or through an employer and then from there you'd be able to invest your money much more efficiently doing this is incredibly easy it'll probably take you about 20 minutes and ideally you should aim to save anywhere between 10 to 20 percent of your income the third try to have between two to six months worth of your expenses saved up in cash this is meant to be like your emergency fund so you can have something to fall back in case you need it,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,so if you spend usually a thousand dollars a month try to save up between two thousand to six thousand dollars and put all of it in a high yield savings account and finally fourth get yourself invested in the markets I think it's so important that you at least begin investing at this age even if it's just a hundred dollars that way you'll be able to see what it's like you'll get your feet wet,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,and I promise you once you start you're not going to want to stop not to mention you could use the link in the description in our sponsorpublic.com we'll be giving you a free stock worth all the way up to a thousand dollars when you make a deposit with the code gram so hopefully that should at least give you a bit of a head start all right now from the age of 25 to 29 there really aren't that many changes with an average net worth of forty nine thousand three hundred and eighty seven dollars except it's worth noting that the median net worth in this category actually went down to 7 500 and 11 likely because this is the age you begin moving out on your own getting adult responsibilities stop having fun and having to pay your own cell phone bill however if you're in the top one percent in this category you're going to see your net worth increase to 606 188.36 to be honest at this age your priority should really be about finding a good long-term career building to your strengths and maximizing your income to be able to save as much money as possible ideally you should also be tracking your expenses keeping a budget and understanding how much you're going to need saved and invested in order to retire I know it could sound really boring to start thinking about right now but the truth is when it comes to investing starting in your 20s could put you so much further ahead by the time that you're older just consider this if you want to have one and a half billion dollars invested by the age of 65 you could do that by investing 416 dollars a month beginning at the age of 25 at an average of an 8 return however if you procrastinate and don't get started until the age of 35 you would need to invest almost a thousand dollars a month to reach that exact same goal so if the choice is yours save 416 dollars now or a thousand dollars a month later speaking of your 30s though this is the age where you'll really begin to see the biggest differences for example the media net worth of those aged 30 to 34 is 35 000 the average is a hundred and twenty two thousand dollars and if you want to be in the top one percent of this category you need to be worth about a million dollars although if you thought that was a lot just wait if we look at the exact same category for those aged 35 to 39 the media net worth jumps to fifty five thousand dollars the average more than doubles to two hundred and seventy four thousand dollars and the top one percent have a net worth of more than four million dollars so what just happened well most likely this is the time your income and career really begin picking up this could also be the point where some people are fortunate to exit their business benefit from an IPO or have a few very well-timed Investments that bump up the top one percent although in terms of actionable steps that you could take throughout your 30s to dramatically increase your net worth here's what I would recommend first aim to completely get rid of any bad debt this means you paid off any loans above a six to seven percent interest rate you don't have any outstanding credit card debt or personal loans and besides the possibility of a mortgage you have nothing else weighing you down the second you should try to save at least twenty percent of your income my personal approach with this that's worked really well for me is that anytime I make more money I just pretend that money doesn't exist,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,and I just automatically invest it out of sight out of mind and I keep spending the exact same as it happened and third if you want to stay on track for retirement your net worth should be equal to four times your annual expenses or two times your annual income by the age of 35.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,when it comes to this the blog Mr Money Mustache has the perfect chart that shows you exactly how much you'll have to save in order to retire for example someone who saves 10 of their income would be able to retire after 51 years will someone saving forty percent could retire into 22 years by viewing everything from this perspective it'll give you a much greater understanding in terms of exactly how much you'll need to save and for how long now by the time you're in your 40s things really begin to speed up the median net worth between 40 and 49 is 164 000 the average is 761 000 and if you want to be in the top one percent that'll be about ten and a half million dollars interestingly enough though one of the biggest drivers of net worth in your 40s isn't necessarily your savings your income or your expenses but instead your home that means that at this age buying a home is one of the largest factors that positively affects your net worth likely because a mortgage forces you to automatically build equity every month and in general homes tend to go up in value of course you could also argue that those who have a higher income and more financial literacy are more likely to buy a home to begin with which skews the data but either way at this age number one you should consider buying a home now this one's certainly not required but buying a home is going to give you a lot more stability in the sense that you're not going to have to worry about your living situation in retirement what's paid off you're not going to be at the whims of a landlord and values over time have generally gone up in value depending on where you're buying the second if possible you should also max out your retirement accounts interestingly enough your 40s also coincide with what's called your Peak earning years meaning you've built up enough experience and momentum to command a significantly higher salary so ideally if you're interested in retiring before the age of 65 you should be working to max out your Roth IRA and your 401k to make sure you're on track and finally third if possible aim to have between five and seven years of your expenses saved up that's because for a 30-year retirement you're going to have to have between 25 and 33 times your annual spending invested in order for that money not to run out and in your 40s this is the number you should really be focusing on not necessarily your net worth but then from there we have your 50s with a median net worth of 171 thousand dollars an average net worth of one million one hundred and sixty five thousand dollars and a top one percent Network worth of 17 million five hundred and forty five thousand dollars by this age most experts recommend that you have anywhere between five to seven times your annual salary saved up and invested in order to be on track to retire which means the median person is very much behind and has a lot of catching up to do just consider this it was found that the average person spends fifty thousand dollars a year in retirement which works out to be forty one hundred and twenty eight dollars a month so with an average Social Security payment coming in at twenty four hundred and eighty four dollars a month that means you'll need to bring in a monthly income of sixteen hundred and forty four dollars to bridge the difference assuming no major health complications no social security issues and no unexpected life events that means following the four percent rule which suggests that you could spend four percent of your portfolio every single year without running out you would need five hundred thousand dollars invested not including the value of your house car or anything else that isn't producing an income that's why first you should absolutely track your expenses this will give you a a better understanding in terms of how much you'll need in retirement and will give you a blueprint to how much you'll need to save to get there this might also include moving to a cheaper location cutting back in your expenses or doing anything else that you can to plan for a time that you may no longer be working and second depending on your situation you should be about halfway through or very close to paying off your mortgage hopefully when that happens it'll reduce your expenses dramatically and give you a lot of peace of mind that no matter what happens you have a home that's completely paid off now remember that doesn't mean that you can't work or make money at all in retirement but it is about giving you the option of not working whether that be voluntary or out of necessity and finally we have the net worth in your 60s which is where the numbers begin to Peak as you could see the median net worth is 271 thousand dollars the average is 1.25 million dollars and if you want to be in the top one percent it's a net worth of 16.4 million surprisingly everything from this point on is kind of downhill for example every age bracket afterwards from median average and top 1 percent declines likely as they begin working less and spending down their money however a few things in this age bracket will begin to happen,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,and no I'm not talking about lower back pain instead first you'll most likely have already paid off your mortgage this will give you a paid off asset that you could always sell in the event you want to retire in Florida second spending actually begins to decline after the age of 65.,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
aza0yR6uDgs,even though it might sound kind of depressing research suggests that worsening Health associated with aging reduces the need or desire for some types of spending such as trips and Vacations so at least the bright side is that you'd be able to save a little bit more if you haven't done that already and finally third now is the time that you could begin withdrawing from your retirement accounts without incurring a penalty remember all the profits you made in a Roth IRA are completely tax and penalty free after the age of 59 and a half so enjoy you can also begin collecting from Social Security in your late 60s along with cashing out of a 401k so go ahead and buy that Lamborghini you've always wanted just kidding anyway all of this is meant to get you to real realize that at the end of the day even though net worth is something to consider a much more reliable indicator of financial Independence is simply how much money you spend relative to how much you make just remember that it's completely possible for somebody to be worth 20 million dollars and be completely broke because they constantly spend more money than they make just like it's possible for somebody to be worth five hundred thousand dollars and be financially free because they only spend twenty thousand dollars a year that's why I think what really matters the most is just how much money do you spend it's all about realizing this as soon as possible and then working within your means to optimize your spending and saving as efficiently as you can so with that said you guys thank you so much for watching as always feel free to add me on Instagram and don't forget that you could get a free stock with all the way up to a thousand dollars with response republic.com Down Below in the description when you make a deposit with the good gram enjoy thank you so much and until next time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

t5w5mk1_K3A,and they quickly became a prominent lender throughout Silicon Valley while catering almost exclusively to venture capital essentially this became the startups Bank where CEOs and businesses would go for funding and for the last several decades that worked out incredibly well until recently and you're going to want to follow along in 2020 when interest rates were reduced to zero and stimulus measures were put in place both Banks and people were flush with cash and almost all of that funneled back into the banking system which is where things began to go wrong see Banks currently operate on what's called fractional Reserve banking this means that banks are required to keep at least 10 percent of their customers money available at all times for withdrawals just imagine it like this you give me your thousand dollars to hold on to for safe keeping but I could turn around to give 900 of that to somebody else who could give 810 to somebody else who could give 729 dollars to somebody else under this situation Banks hope that enough people give them 1000 dollar deposits so that when the first person wants their money back they'll have enough cash on hand to process that withdrawal the benefit to doing this is that this allows their customers access to a much larger pool of money and they're able to earn interest on their deposits but that also relies on everyone having faith that the system works and not all pulling their money out at the exact same time which has started to happen now to be fair in most cases Banks aren't lending to other Banks who lend to other Banks who lend to other Banks instead Banks often take your money loan out a portion of it and invest the rest in really really safe and stable Investments like U.S treasuries this ensures that as long as those treasuries are held to maturity the bank gets near the guaranteed rate of return customers could be made whole and everyone wins except in this case and here's why in 2021 and early 2022 Silicon Valley bank took roughly a hundred billion dollars and invested that into government-backed bonds with a significant portion of that locked away for three to four years at an interest rate of just one point seven nine percent essentially this meant that Silicon Valley bank took a massive bet that the Federal Reserve was not going to raise interest rates as fast as they did and when they turned out to be wrong that put them in a very dangerous position see bonds like this are valued based on their yield and in this case Silicon Valley Bank was on the wrong side of the transaction to lose a lot of money just imagine it like this as an example Silicon Valley bank took a hundred dollars and bought a two percent interest rate for four years as long as they could hold it for the full four years they'll receive a hundred and eight dollars and 24 cents back and be paid in full no problem whatsoever but what would happen if interest rates suddenly increased right after you made your investment and all of a sudden you could buy that exact same 100 at a seven percent return and make 131 dollars over this exact same four years well in that case sure hundred dollar two percent Bond would have to decline to 77 is to be worth what you could buy at today's prices and if you can't afford to hold out for the full four years to get your money back you're going to be forced to take a loss and that's what's starting to happen and normally Banks would have enough Capital coming in from a variety of sources to cover customer withdrawals but in this case Silicon Valley Bank's customer base or mainly technology companies which have seen significantly less funding and that means that their companies are forced to take more money out of the bank to pay for their own expenses essentially Silicon Valley Banks severely misjudged the size and pace of the federal reserve's rate hikes while assuming that the Venture Capital Market would continue to stay strong that left them in a situation where they locked too much of their money away in one specific asset that yielded too low of a return and that occurred at the exact same time their customers began withdrawing more money than they anticipated this of course is where the dominoes begin to fall on Wednesday March 8th,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t5w5mk1_K3A,the company announced that they would be selling off a third of their ownership in an effort to raise 2.25 billion dollars this was done in response to them being forced to take a 1.5 billion dollar loss on a portion of their bond position which was done to bring enough money back to the bank to be able to continue processing withdrawals the problem however came on March 9th when Ward got out that the company could potentially be facing insolvency issues and as a result their stock price plummeted more than 60 percent making it unlikely that the company would be able to raise additional Capital to help plug the losses at that point the entire situation devolved into a full-scale panic it was reported that their CEO had been calling clients to assure them that their money with the bank is safe well startup Founders had been advised to pull their money out as soon as possible just in case but overnight things got even worse on the morning of March 10th,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t5w5mk1_K3A,Silicon Valley Bank announced that they had failed to raise capital and instead were looking for a buyer meaning they quite literally ran out of money had more withdrawals than they had cash on hand and were looking for anyone who could potentially take them over unfortunately though that seems like too little too late because just a few hours after that Silicon Valley Bank was shut down and closed by Regulators with the message that all of the bank's deposits have been transferred to the new Bank of course you might be thinking to yourself FDIC Insurance exists for a reason and they should be able to recover up to 250 thousand dollars almost immediately except uh yeah,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t5w5mk1_K3A,that's another problem here's the thing is most of you know anytime you make a deposit within a bank you're protected by what's called FDIC insurance which protects up to the first two hundred and fifty thousand dollars you have deposited in the event of a bank failure this was created after the bank runs the 1920s Great Depression as a way to incentivize people to re-trust the banking system and it largely worked since then FDIC insurance has continued to evolve for any Bank who wants to legally operate in the United States and the good news is that it's a fairly efficient system in fact their website says that you could get access to your money within a few days after the bank's closing however in this case the bad news is that as Genevieve from grit Capital points out only two point seven percent of silicon Valley's Bank deposits are less than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars meaning ninety seven point three percent of their money is not FDIC insured and it's not clear exactly what's going to happen to all of that money now typically in cases where deposits exceed the FDIC limit losses are recovered in a bankruptcy court when assets are sold off to pay their creditors but his bank rate explains that process could take several years to complete and more than likely their customers are not going to receive all of their money back from what they started with although to me that isn't even the worst of it instead it's just how far this is about to reach over the coming few days and weeks and I have a feeling this is really only the tip of the iceberg for those in aware Silicon Valley Bank isn't just a bank for the average person they're the bank for a significant portion of venture-backed companies throughout the United States and when those businesses keep a significant portion or even all of their money with one institution they could be completely wiped out overnight the reality is many of these institutions have raised millions or even tens of millions of dollars with the expectation that that's going to be enough to last them throughout these next few years those businesses have carefully saved money kept it liquid for emergencies and have spent it wisely only to have it reduced to 250 000 overnight from that perspective this is going to be crippling to every single business that banks with Silicon Valley Bank especially since they currently hold more than 342 billion dollars worth of customer funds now realistically a startup is not going to lose all their money with the bank and it's not like every dollar over 250 000 is suddenly worth zero but it could take years to recover whatever's left and whether or not the company has enough money to stay afloat in the meantime is completely up in the air I would venture to say that most of them cannot just consider that everything from payroll company expenditures and all of their overheads could be held in One bank and 250 000 could be a drop in the buck pocket for a company who had saved significantly more to make it through a time of slower growth there's really no way out of this with the exception of trying to raise cash as desperately as possible in a panic at a discount downsizing significantly or going under which is something that no one thought would happen just a week ago so that then of course begs the question could the same thing happen to your bank the answer is it's possible but it's unlikely the issue with Silicon Valley Bank was that they were in a niche market servicing startups and were funded by Venture Capital which was drying up that meant that very little money was flowing in a lot of money was flowing out and the majority of the bank's Capital was locked away in bonds for the next four years at a low interest rate that had declined in value essentially this meant that if the bank were to wait long enough they would have enough cash on hand and potentially absorb the short-term losses but when everyone begins withdrawing all of their money all at the exact same time the bank is left with no other choice other than to shut down now sure in essence every every single Bank operates this way and is only required to keep 10 percent of customer funds on hand at all time to process withdrawals but in Silicon Valley Bank's case they went all in on the bond market at the worst possible time at the very Peak,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t5w5mk1_K3A,well their customers were moving money out of the bank during a time where they needed capital and wanted a higher return it was really a perfect storm for most other Banks though the FED Bice chair recently said that there are obviously larger institutions that are also exposed to these risks too but the exposure tends to be a very small part of their balance sheet so even if they experience the same deposit outflows they're more insulated that's why I think in order to best protect yourself you should never keep more than what's insured from the FDIC which is typically two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for an individual bank or stick with one of the larger institutions who's more likely Diversified and more likely to be okay for almost all of you watching I would venture to say that it's probably not going to make any difference whatsoever because most people don't keep more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash in any given bank but in the big picture it's a very good example that you should never keep all of your eggs in one basket you should always have multiple accounts in good standing with other Banks just as something to fall back on and at the end of the day sometimes things could happen that are completely outside of your control even if you do everything right as far as what happens next is really anybody's guess,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0
t5w5mk1_K3A,it's still unclear if it's possible for another bank to swoop in and buy them up or if Silicon Valley Bank is deemed systemically too big to fail while the government steps in to prevent what could potentially be tens of thousands of employees losing their jobs and companies going under or if they're going to be forced to go through bankruptcy with 97 of their customers waiting to see what's going to happen personally I have very mixed feelings on this first I find it surprising that a bank would have the ability to lock away a substantial portion of their assets and essentially bet their customers money on the decisions of the Federal Reserve to me no Bank should be legally allowed to take such a sizable risk and there should be more regulation in place to make sure that deposits are properly Diversified second the FDIC limit of 250 000 makes absolutely no sense to me when 97 of their depositors were above that amount to begin with I think the business accounts should have access to significantly higher limits since after all they have operational expenses payroll and overhead to meet not just as an individual but for an entire company that also supports tens or even thousands of employees in that case it would make way more sense for the FDIC limit to be based on a percentage of what that person deposits I mean let's be real a business is not operating a 10 million dollar bank account the same way an individual would who's probably never going to see 250 000 cash in their lifetime that's why I think it makes way more sense to base the FDIC limits on a percentage of what they have deposited or an average account balance just in case something happens like what we just saw but again all of this is likely too little too late and the best that we could do right now is just to wait and see what happens so with that said you guys thank you so much for watching as always feel free to add me on Instagram and don't forget you could grab a free stock Down Below in the description with our sponsorpublic.com because that could be worth all the way up to a thousand dollars when you make it deposit with the code gram enjoy thank you so much and until next time,overall_long_video_data.csv,0.0

6LtYmBoBg_4,and it does until you're ready to cave in and that is when things come back up i know today is is a day where you're very very tempted to sell to dump it all you've seen the losses and you just can't take it anymore but let me tell you we have seen periods of time in bitcoin's history where this same thing has happened what's going on right now i know seems very very very very bad that it can't get any worse and maybe bitcoin goes down even more from here but guess what the bull run is not over bitcoin is not dead all coins will come back this is time to be strong to get those diamond hands to believe to believe what you're involved with crypto as we all know is volatile there will be times where it'll be great and i would say the last four months have been absolutely fantastic today is one of those days where we get knocked down,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
6LtYmBoBg_4,but it really depends on if you can get back up so stay strong my friends stay strong do not fold in today clearly a lot of people did a lot of people that thought they had diamond hands couldn't handle it turn into paper hands and decided to sell and it caused a cascading effect among other things liquidations and whale manipulation you add it all up this is what we're seeing now and bitcoin is at 32 000 but like i've always stated you have to play the long game you have to focus on the future you have to focus why you're in bitcoin and crypto in the first place not to make a quick buck not to make a quick flip but you're in it to make life changing wealth and how you do that is play the long game by dollar cost averaging and holding and on a day like today when everything is in red and there's a lot of blood in the streets this is when you need to take advantage and you need to hold strong and not panic so stay strong my friends,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0

ycrn6n10dEA, well thanks to you guys that have stayed to the end of the market update video and I will tell my dad joke so we're obviously talking about baby names is we've got the little fella Jew any day now and we was speaking to a friend of ours a nurse who did tell us this story now she was dealing with a younger mom who was a little bit distressed you know what was going on do you really know she was even pregnant actually when she came into the hospital anyway she didn't have a baby name and so that had the baby delivered the child and the nurses came in said have you a name for the baby yeah and she said no I don't think so anyway she had a good night's sleep and woke up the next morning and came in and said they once asked her again have you picked a name yet and that she said oh no I think I'm just gonna stick with the name that it came with and the nurses looked at each other and thought what I said oh what's that and they said all for male,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
ycrn6n10dEA,and she said oh okay where did that come from what do you mean the name that she came in and she said are the doctors or the nurses must have named it because on her wristband it says for male and she had had a little girl and it did say the birthday and female on her wristband so there you go I'm not sure we'll have that problem if we are having a little boy but that was certainly interesting story nonetheless let me know you guys favorite baby names in the comments below and then anything that we need to avoid are there any recommendations I was thinking maybe 8th and after aetherium but I don't think Jim is gonna allow that one so thanks for tuning in guys members I will talk to you guys soon otherwise I'll talk to you guys in a week or two after we've enjoyed some time with the little fella so cheese guys,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Mo7COWpqPGc, hi guys we're back at end Con with the guys from Sigma prime hey guy and welcome to the channel and you guys are Australian which I didn't know and it's awesome to see more good projects and good people in our own backyard so for those at home that haven't followed what does sigma prime do so we're traditionally security cyber security firm we work in pretty much block chain cyber security at the moment and we're building an f2 client in rust called lighthouse and for those at home that don't know what that means that's the new etherium chain that they're launching for proof of stake and we need to build clients that people can build on it is the best way to describe it I guess yes so it exists yep and you guys must be pretty happy to get three thousand 8th from vitalik himself recently yeah we've got so three thousand was given we got one thousand that was pretty exciting I thought Twitter it was a bit of a waste of time but after that I realized that maybe not yeah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Mo7COWpqPGc,I think you can learn a lot from Twitter so for those people at home that don't know what's it like being developer if you don't have that funding like how are you scrapping to stay alive is off the back of your own investing or you trying to get a bit of VC money here and there or well so when we started we were we would do a bit of consulting to later kind of the startups at around Sydney and we were basically funding ourselves we were kind of just taking low low page so effectively paying ourselves out of our own pockets yeah and then eventually work ramped up to the point where we could actually all the things that we did during the day were work elated and we're interested in and it was paying the bills and is there an easy way to describe for people at home that I drove tech savvy why aetherium smart contracts tend to be buggy and why they need auditing and the things that you guys do yeah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Mo7COWpqPGc,so in traditional I guess software development you can write some fried a piece of code test it put it out for production and then later on you find that I'll wait there's a mistake it doesn't work right and so your traditional development is usually an iterative process so you make some code you find some bugs you update it so with smart contracts because the blockchain is ideally supposed to be immutable you can't do that so no one really writes perfect code the first time you do it you're always going to have something something go wrong and so typically that's why that's why it's difficult you to be very very careful when you actually write your first iteration how much you guys produce software to order like what percentage of that then becomes manual and still requires someone having a good set of eyes versus putting it through your contract or quanta stamps or something like that yeah so there's are not a number of different companies in the space that are building automated tools for security analysis from our side,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Mo7COWpqPGc,we we use those as more of like a side side testing framework a lot of ours is still manual and building automated tests so the manual review is finding business logic and some actually rather kind of difficult things to test we an automated tooling so we do a combination of manual reviews as well as as well as some of those automated tests you're fantastic any final thoughts for everyone at home or did you want to add something to that as well no no that's good yeah awesome well thanks so much for joining us today guys and keep doing the good work I'm sure have you on the channel again in future awesome thank you Alex,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
p4KKPKoIsGg, hi guys we're here with Simon from Loki hey yo man good how are ya pretty good thanks we're gonna chat about everything you've been up to in the last few months and how are you enjoying ahead Conn so far it Khan's been pretty good so far yeah I came here obviously like he's not an etherion project but it seems to be the biggest thing that is going to happen in the Australian blockchain seen all year so I thought you know it's only a two-hour flight why not yeah there's been a lot of familiar faces and some pretty interesting talks today about what etherium is doing regards to their consensus mechanism and all of the problems to do with proof of stake and other things yes but ya know it's it's been pretty good so far let's chat Loki though today so you've been up to heaps I see always in my newsfeed even since we last spoke only a few months ago so what's been happening yeah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
p4KKPKoIsGg,what always lots happening we're just steaming ahead with our product development I guess is what you could say but since we last spoke I think we now have working examples of all of the different components of the local network so our Onion Router is relatively stable at the moment though it keeps breaking every element that's that's fine Messenger is basically complete on desktop which is exciting and we've made a lot of changes and upgrades to the core protocol on the blockchain as well to keep things rolling along there so now it's now we're really working on sort of gluing it all together which is taking quite a while it's taken us maybe four months now to really get things to work well together and excitingly where´s now starting to be able to spin up these tests now these test nets where we have the Onion Router being regulated by the blockchain and all the different node aspects working there we have swarms are now complete as well so we're now able to do messaging as we initially intended it to work through this decentralized server architecture which is really exciting so,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
p4KKPKoIsGg,yeah things are really coming together it's now just about ironing out the the last sort of bits and pieces so we can now think about when we're gonna put it on the main net yeah which is exciting in my estimation will probably be in the next few months but yeah we shall see yeah I was just saying freeing to be that the so many privacy sort of coins out there but the fact that you guys have that second lie is very very exciting and privacy is always in the headlines any thoughts on all that stuff particularly in Australia with the encryption laws yeah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
p4KKPKoIsGg,so I actually wrote a really in-depth response to that bill I pored over it through all of the stages of its iteration and thankfully the last iteration of it was a lot more favorable to a lot of people I would suggest I think I don't think the legislators really understood what they were doing when they created it there was something that came out a few weeks ago where their New South Wales Chief of Police basically said we have very little clue what we're gonna do with this legislation exactly so and all the rhetoric they were spinning about how are we got to get this out before Christmas because otherwise bad things are gonna happen yeah was just complete bollocks because the legislation itself requires a 30 day notice period before any development work can take place anyway and by that point it would have been well past New Year's so it's just a complete joke I think I remember reading all that at the time but it's good that people will have other options to maintain their privacy in future well that's right,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
p4KKPKoIsGg,I mean whatever legislation does exist there are technological solutions to people that live in jurisdictions where certain you know acts of freedom of speech are not respected so we're aiming yeah obviously aiming to provide some of those tools but you know there there's a big education piece that goes along with that as well like you don't want to just be arbitrarily circumventing jurisdiction just for the sake of it you know you better have a good reason and you better know what you're doing when you do it as well yeah well it's great work that you guys are doing I'm sure we'll catch up again in future but thanks for joining us thank you very much Alex chase,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

gwFIie5y8CE,and yeah they were here one of the things I didn't think about was how it's got to be a country was easy to get a visa for everyone and all that sort of thing because there's just so many contributors from around the world for theatres in those days isn't it yeah that's true actually to be honest this is a very painful problem because already last year in Toronto half of the link time team which are the guys that are working their ass off won't bring it here they couldn't get visas to Canada now half of them can get visas to come here which I mean for us egotistically it's nice to have it here but actually I'm now pushing them to do it in Schengen which is their headquarters so the hashtag is basically hashtag ed contingent 2020 yeah please oh I might be flying out because I've honestly had such a good time of this conference so far I learnt so much so what are your highlights so far yeah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
gwFIie5y8CE,I think this conference is really awesome cause it's um it's kind of like DEFCON little brother little sister it's much more intimate you can really get in contact with anyone you want and it's a little bit less you know less glamorous yeah I think that's right like he can pull aside anyway and we literally got to ask fatale like half dozen questions just before in the press conference which is up on YouTube as well but as you say all these people coming together I'm gonna have to talk it's just like the ideas of flowing and the futures never been brighter would you agree with at all yeah like given that the the crypto winter is in the midst of still happening I actually see it as a very good thing cuz everyone's really focused on building actually just before the conference we had the ED Khan hack over in UNSW which is where the bit for the community is home bases yeah so we were also fortunate to host all those amazing people and on board even more people to the developer ecosystem and build creative stuff,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

Ggb89xtOT-M,I haven't heard anything about any of this stuff do you guys are you familiar with this in this case let me know in the comments below what you guys know because I I find this interesting that he's wrapped up in some sort of legal issue about a board apiat club uh and I've seen so much fun and so much crazy stuff related to the board ape Yacht Club and little things little symbols and things hidden throughout um I don't even want to repeat a lot of it because if it's not true I don't I don't want to paint him in a negative light but there's definitely a lot of crazy conspiracy going on with the board apes and now this I don't know is the first I've heard of anything about it what do you guys think is this a legit thing or is there more to it if you know fill me in in the comments I'd really appreciate it until next time Crow your coins and I'll see you soon,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
KG9i8O2HA_c, foreign [Music] what's going on ladies and gentlemen this is going to be a quick one I just wanted to make a point that twelve thousand dollar Bitcoin has already been hit and and I I calculated this up and I'm this is dead dead accurate current U.S inflation rates between 2020 and 2023. now if we if we zoom in on this I'm going to show you something here this is the inflation rate since 2020 okay it's it's kind of crazy I I didn't realize it was really this bad I mean all I can say is this is just another example of what bad man said uh and predicted actually being true uh is anyone seeing this yet,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
KG9i8O2HA_c,so if we look at the inflation rates of 2021 we're looking at seven percent 2022 six and a half percent 2023 6 which takes us about 19 and a half percent inflation which ultimately means that the dollar is basically worth less okay now if we were to look at this on a Bitcoin chart what do we see here if we had our bottom at around fifteen thousand five hundred dollars or so and we dropped the price down to around 20 percent what do we have let's just take this to about 1905. uh well that's about 19 too so nineteen five that's good enough and we're sitting right at about twelve thousand dollars in Bitcoin so if we didn't have the inflation then it's very likely the price would have come down even further but because this is just one of those things one of those things that's happening outside of the general cycle of the crypto currency Market that we're not calculating in that we're not figuring in these things that's why we're all waiting for a lower low,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
KG9i8O2HA_c,well we got it it's just because the dollar is worth less that we didn't have to move that far to get the numbers we were expecting to see so from now on as we move forward we need to start taking into account the crazy money printing that's going on that's likely only going to get worse as we continue to move forward especially with bank bailouts and whatever else is going on so keep that in mind until next time guys Crow your coins I'll see you soon,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Cn1Xzr3mNPk, in the history of money we've never seen a form of money that has been so scarce and so secure before and so easily transferable and easily divisible there's nothing out there that can compete with Bitcoin gold for example is just much slower than Bitcoin obviously you cannot just send a gold bar over to whatever it's Russia or to to I don't know Slovenia you can't just cross-border send gold Bitcoin just a few minutes and you can send it wherever the the US dollar or any other fiat currency out there they may be fast to transact but they're not secure they are centralized someone can print a uh print a trillion dollars just by pressing a button so there's pros and cons with all different forms of money we're using today the only form of money that has every every single thing that checks all the boxes is Bitcoin,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Cn1Xzr3mNPk,yeah especially that the for CE of the Bitcoin is very high today the volatility is still high but will go down in the future as the liquidity goes up if you look at the past 13 years of Bitcoin the volatility has dramatically decreased every single year as more and more people are using it that's why one of my big missions right now is to get people into Bitcoin because the more people that use it the more useful it becomes just like any social media Network for example the more people that use Facebook the more useful it becomes so the network effect is very very important so as soon as everyone is using Bitcoin which will happen ultimately because the free market is always right and the free market will soon realize that Bitcoin is the best form of money in the world because it simply is,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
GyKLi9aGkSA,hello guys and welcome to the Moon my name is Carl and I'm going to bring you this cryptocurrency video right now Bitcoin is breaking down and we can see that Bitcoin is running into some major major uh support right now and if you watched my video earlier today then you might potentially be in profits right now because I talked about how uh we might see a correction and I will show you my my short in just a minute but basically we can see here that this support is very very important and this report is here at 27.8 approximately and something that might be forming here is a head and shoulders shoulder Head and Shoulder let me know guys in the comments what you think about that but let me talk about ethereum because earlier today um I this is over on a bit flex by the way link down below if you want to switch from buy bit to bitflix um here is the um the ethereum price and we have seen a pretty decent um correction here and that's exactly why I put in this short position earlier today if you watched my video from earlier today then you might be in some profits let me show you the video actually so if you go to my channel um here there you go look at that,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
GyKLi9aGkSA,so I made this video called no because we saw this head and shoulders on ethereum and I predicted that we're gonna see a a break to the downside on ethereum and Bitcoin but ethereum is where I made my trade and I put my trade here over on the bitflix um and many people have been asking also where to go because buy bit is now implementing kyc uh on the 8th of May and that's why I am right now trading here as you can see over on uh bitflix um so here you see right now we are in profits guys so big shout out to all of you who put in this trade uh if you also are trading right now ethereum that we made this uh pretty nice trade to the downside the question is of course are we going to go lower here,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
GyKLi9aGkSA,well I'm gonna keep my short position open and if we go to the 24 hour time frame you can see that ethereum is actually in an uptrend but we are seeing a potential potential break towards the downside that could continue lower now that I'm looking at it though we are actually coming into some pretty heavy support here you know what I don't even know why I didn't see that before I started this video that's a great um you know what I'm gonna take small profits here I'm gonna exit uh let's see here I'm gonna exit approximately let's exit 40 of the trade actually based on that we could still go lower which is why it's nice to keep having the short open but taking some profits it's it's always good you know um this was not a big trade I'm not gonna pretend like this was a big trade but sometimes when I see a short coming up I make a small little short uh when I go long I usually go hundreds of thousands of dollars when I go short I go smaller uh,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
GyKLi9aGkSA,and I try to just catch small breakdowns like this one like this one if we go lower here then for sure I'm gonna go much more heavy here we could short all the way down to previous support down here that is ethereum um if you want to try bitflix I have a link down below you can get up to two thousand dollars um if you click the link down below and you know buy a bit I still like buy a bit but some people are really asking so much about where to go now that they Implement their kyc and everything so yeah link down below to Big flicks see you in the next video bye-bye,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0

I6_ipj02bvM,and then you know what happened nothing no one seems to care enough people seem to care on two occasions where Jamie Dimon said something negative and the markets went down is this a damn popularity contest you know what roll that clip just makes me feel better so the IntercontinentalExchange or ice for short is a company which owns the New York Stock Exchange and other global marketplaces and is forming the new company named fact right we've heard this they've got major retailers already adopting it in Starbucks and Microsoft cool but did you know they're going to launch as soon as November and not just as a payment processor exposing Bitcoin to millions of no coiners but a tool for money managers to offer Bitcoin mutual funds pension funds and ETFs as a highly regulated mainstream investment even credit cards again involved MasterCard won a patent last month for speeding up crypto payments they could theoretically offer a credit card for Bitcoin they're financially incentivized those transaction fees do add up to quite a lot,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
I6_ipj02bvM,so this is mainstream people big time it doesn't get any bigger unless of course it was China lifting the banking ban on Bitcoin that would probably be bigger we don't even need the SEC to approve a Bitcoin ETF assumably if you can buy Bitcoin directly through your brokerage alongside your stock portfolio we don't need the CBOE ETF you know that thing that everyone's waiting for redundant almost not quite this will be nice to have it but many can point the finger of scorn at Bitcoin this year and say that investment too volatile but if you get global trading volume like this stability the most amazing thing after all this is Bitcoin drop 7% on the day how is that possible how do how are you kidding me okay,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

McSVXIJw6FI, thanks for tuning in to another episode of nuggets news today's video is just going to be a short sharp tutorial I'm going to show you how to use a really cool feature of the electron wallet so what this allows you to do is to send multiple transactions at once in the one Unchained transaction so if you haven't seen the video I recently did about how cryptocurrency transactions work the blockchain Explorer tutorial I recommend you check that out I will link that in the description below and in a blockchain Explorer you can see how a Bitcoin transaction will often go from one address 1 1 input and end up having multiple outputs there,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
McSVXIJw6FI,and so I'm going to show you how you can do this and send it to all these different people at once so recently we ran a bit of a promotion we've eToro where you could get $100 Bitcoin if you sign up and deposit and complete a couple of trades so I've got a list of people that I need to send that hundred dollar bonus Bitcoin to so I'm gonna head over to my electrum wallet I'm gonna open this up this is a desktop wallet you can set it up the same as you would any wallet it's gonna ask you to write down those backup words you know set an encrypted password all that usual stuff,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
McSVXIJw6FI,I'm not going to do a tutorial on how to setup electrum today but it is very similar to setting up all different types of crypto wallets all I'm going to show you to do is how to send so let's just go to tools here and let's click on pay too many and then it's going to bring up this screen and all we have to do is just paste the list of addresses and after each address we just have to put a space comma space and then the amount so I'm just gonna paste that there now and as you'll see I've got a list of about 20 addresses followed by comma space and the amount that we've worked out to be $100 Bitcoin so there's there's 20 different addresses in there I tend to do about 20 the fee at the moment is really low bitcoins chugging along quite nicely so this is probably gonna cost me about $1 to send to more than 20 people so less than 5 cents per transaction so it makes it a lot cheaper I'm using a Segway format address again that just makes it a bit cheaper all these things these efficiency improvements on constantly talking about hopefully you find this interesting that's all coming together so as long as I've got it in that format it's gonna ask me for a description so let's just put eToro and this was the last remaining batch that we did,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
McSVXIJw6FI,so it's our last I can preview it I can sign that transaction with my private key in advance and that's gonna get it ready to broadcast at a future date or if I just close that I can just click on send and it's going to do it as well now that's then gonna ask me for my password so I'm gonna come down behind me here you guys won't be able to see that I'm gonna open up my password manager she have a nice strong encrypted password for everything you do online copy that password click on paste there okay that's gonna broadcast it payment sent as simple as that so we've just got the notification electrum has completed that transaction we can head over and see that it's unconfirmed now I can right click on that look at it on a blockchain Explorer all these things are possible as I said check out the blockchain Explorer tutorial we did recently if you want more information about any of this stuff and how it all works,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

xOrubRkZei8,yes that's that's the initial launch of the network within probably six to eight weeks we're looking to as I said sort of stage a rollout of Haven back moments initially the foundation and then we'll go from there and the key to success is getting people using this in the real world do you think this is more community driven or are you going for those real world relationships with businesses or a bit about a bit of both so we see one of the immediate use cases as trading so you know we've got a number of exchanges both centralized and decentralized that are looking for a stable unit of account so working very closely to start building those relationships but on the other side we've got a number of businesses that operate you know supply chains and to some testing something that will allow them to move money faster yeah cool so how do you see this playing out in the next few years man would you love to see this be a success in Australia are you really trying to conquer yeah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
xOrubRkZei8,this is a global marketplace so you know obviously we're using the US dollar as a peg effectively yeah and the purpose of that is here it's a global reserve currency so we want you know anyone anywhere to be able to transact in it so eventually we will have other flavors of notes which might be you know even the Australian dollar potentially yen euros yeah beautiful I think there's gonna be a big demand for that in the future in every currency as well so that's great - yeah for sure yeah any other closing comments made are things that excited about coming up look I mean you know it's a very exciting period for the project we were working on it for a long time so we're excited to actually get something out of the market and see we've got a couple of competitors out there so make it out obviously being one of them,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
xOrubRkZei8,and you know our view is that we just need to start building those relationships and getting transaction volume up as fast as possible I think the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole is going to grow well into the trillions so there's room for more than one stable point you,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
DdfoWxNONf0,hi guys thanks for tuning in to another episode of Nuggets news in this video I wanna clearly explain atomic swaps and how they're gonna allow you users to directly transfer crypto currencies from different block chains now please watch my video on lightning networks if you haven't already to get your head around that concept of off chain side channel technology now so far we've seen decreed Verte coin like winning bitcoins successfully achieve atomic swaps on chain but in the future we will move to a model with seguir in the lining network but this is all going to happen even more instantly privately and with lower fees so at the moment if you want to exchange three different crypto currencies you have to use an exchange or shape-shift or some third party intermediary and what this is gonna do is basically allow for two users to agree which cubed own currencies they're going to swap at a set price and through the use of hash time lock contracts it's going to set a time period and if the trade is not executing that time period that funds will be returned to the individual users now this also utilizes multi-seat wallet technology and all that means is that both users require the other users key to unlock their side of the transaction and access their funds so once this is all locked in that contract the Bitcoin user or the litecoin user can send across the funds and that also sends across the key and as the instant that the litecoin user accesses that fund it also sends their key through the their channel to the other user and that allows them to instantly access their funds and this mechanism basically turns this into one transaction rather than two separate transactions and that's why this is so safe and secure so I hope I've explained that clearly please hit like subscribe if you haven't already share these videos around and as always thanks for tuning in guys Cheers,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
waDWM7xVapI, hey guys we're back at Idi Conde 3 and we've got Alex from flex taps in Melbourne thanks for joining us thank you Alex so what do you guys do well flex taps is develop a collective in Melbourne we work on web 3 things so that means mostly blockchains and mostly aetherium yeah but we just do client work so we're a bunch of bunch of developers we've actually just moved back into YBF we hang out with the the Loki project so we're in their office disrupting them throwing beach balls around the office but yeah we've so we've worked on a few projects we've worked on an identity project with a web 3 venture studio called type human and the Australian Red Cross which is really exciting we've worked with we've worked with a us-based product company called block natives who are trying to solve some of the UX and onboarding problems that decentralized applications have and we also built RMIT on lines blockchain developer course and then other than that we do a bit of groundwork sort of a smart contract development and auditing and things like that yeah cool I have heard of type here,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
waDWM7xVapI,and there you go so what sort of themes have you seen change over the past maybe 24 months when we had too much excitement and now we're back to busy building and are there any sort of areas I know finance has been spoken about a lot here that you see being the sort of next industries to get disruptive yeah definitely I mean it's really interesting to see that like most of the users of decentralized applications are people utilizing decentralized finance so adapts and that's really cool like I don't have a finance background so I I find it hard to kind of conceptualize and think about how to build things in that space specifically yeah but the one thing that's really exciting that I've seen over the last sort of two years is a lot a lot of people with real product rigor coming into the space so for example block native,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
waDWM7xVapI,is this us-based client that we work for and it's really great to work with people that have built products that have had millions of users before coming into the space and trying to wrap their head around the block chain space and what things must be done differently how do we sort of how do we solve these problems without sort of removing all of the benefits of decentralized tech yeah yeah that's probably one thing that a theorem had done well with such a focus on the technology and now that we're seeing the front end and the business minds and those sort of people come to the space as well yeah absolutely but like the trickiest thing from my perspective is like we can make these fantastic applications that allow peer-to-peer exchanges of value and you know the the most sort of obvious business models to just like take a fee like and but a lot of those in a lot of those instances you're making things less peer-to-peer your routing payments through a smart contract rather than allowing peer-to-peer payments yeah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
waDWM7xVapI,and so we kind of need to come up with these really interesting different business models and for me personally like what is what is really the objective is we want to try and come up with some kind of business model which is as effective a positive feedback loop as the platform business model is but then still embodies these web 3 values of decentralized decentralisation privacy liquidity etc that's awesome I'm sure we'll have you guys on the channel in the future when you're we're doing plenty more work if this space continues to take off so thanks for joining us pleasure my friend thank you,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
bjqYN-ONU00, hi guys thanks for tuning in to another episode of Nuggets news in this video on a revisit earth Phoenix it's been nine months since we first covered this on the channel and we've been talking about decentralized exchanges a lot recently so for those that don't know beat Phoenix created an exchange specifically for aetherium and ERC 20 tokens where the aim is to move to a decentralized model of exchange and governance where the community that hold their tokens make decisions about the exchange and what coins get listed so talking of other exchanges recently I've done detailed tutorials guys on ether Delta radar relay khyber we touched on the other day plenty of you guys are excited about the bi Nance decentralized exchange that's in the works but if Phoenix was the least voted for in that Twitter poll and they have had a few exciting announcements that I want to go over so as of today you can start to participate in the governance model and choose what tokens get listed on the exchange by holding the nectar token,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
bjqYN-ONU00,so the nectar token is the native token to this exchange and platform now we've seen those style of tokens perform reasonably well that have a correlation with exchange performance so I think by nan screw coin and those sort of coins now nectar token will have even more inbuilt sort of utility if you want to think of it that way and I'll go over those those use cases now so if you're trading on the platform you'll earn a percentage of fees for being a market maker so adding liquidity to their order books they're guys you will earn those nectar tokens so rather than having a nice ER and raising money they went for this model where they'll be giving it out to the people that use the platform and over time the people that use the platform the most will theoretically be the people that care about the platform the most and they'll be with the ones that are making the decisions about the future of the platform so beat Phoenix the exchange has plenty of different coins whereas Earth Phoenix only has ERC 20 tokens,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
bjqYN-ONU00,but now we get to vote on which ones they'll add next so you can have a tink around with this I plan on doing a very detailed video in the future about all the features of Earth Phoenix and beat Phoenix but for the time being your login details are the same guys your two-factor authentication is the same the coins that you have will be the same on both in the future they want to move to that decentralized model where we'll have no coin store on them at all so let's go over this nectar token just quickly as I said no I see,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
bjqYN-ONU00,oh they'll be dropping it to people that are using the platform so here's the first ten coins that we can choose to vote on and by having some nectar tokens in your wallet the people that have been using the platform and so on in your meta mask your ledger or your keystore file if you save that on your computer you can connect and you can vote on what coin you want to get listed next so pretty cool stuff that you can also earn nectar by being an active member of the community so getting involved with the discussions about different coins all that sort of thing guys being a market maker doing proposals you know maybe the community thinks it's a good idea to do an airdrop to get more people in bought all those sort of things will get you the chance to earn those Nick that as a reward so this is a pretty exciting model I'll have my referral link below they've just announced that program as well today if you use that guys it sends me a few nectar tokens and in the future I can help vote on the good coin,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
bjqYN-ONU00,so let's say we want to get power ledger horizons stay you know good projects listed on there that sort of gives you more influence by having more nectar tokens so hopefully I've explained that reasonably clear guys I'm pretty exciting one to keep an eye on it gives you another option for more ERC 20 tokens and hopefully more liquidity in the future as they incentivize more people to use this platform so hope thanks for tuning in guys I hope you've enjoyed that hit that like button subscribe if you haven't already share these videos around and as always thanks for tuning in guys Cheers,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
pbiZEDgC8ME,[Applause] in 1998 we were presented with a company by a man we've all learned to love and admire for his genius and tenacity paypal was founded by none other than elon musk and several others to make it easy for people to send money digitally from one person to another through a centralized ledger system with their original goal to create the first digital currency however that never materialized but paypal was born and grew from its use on option sites such as ebay over the decades paypal has grown into one of the largest providers of e-commerce settlement in the world with more recent competitors such as square or stripe nipping at its heels however like most banking institutions who snubbed their noses to cryptocurrency early on paypal 2 was a bit of an enemy of the blockchain tech with reports of them freezing assets they deemed coming from crypto and forcing users to source their funds before releasing them an abuse of power in a heavily regulated arena all of which is taking place on centralized servers a blockchain based version of paypal has been needed and you trust was founded to address the needs of the public to provide a safe and secure way of enabling e-commerce on the blockchain while enabling users to utilize their cryptocurrency to make purchases of goods and services like paypal utrust started with a small team of visionaries and dreamers looking to change the world and empower the people and since it was founded in 2017 has grown into a budding team of over 50 individuals that share that same vision their growth in the industry has not only been impressive but the rate at which they are establishing e-commerce partnerships and the scope of those partnerships tells me you trust is going to be the leading blockchain-based e-commerce provider on an international level they are helping e-com businesses drop their fees by as much as 80 percent while opening up to global markets major companies such as adobe marketplace and other e-tailers all over the globe are already adopting you trust to handle payments and you trust has made it very easy to do so you can even integrate you trust into your wordpress web shop although shops are accepting cryptocurrency as payments they no longer need to worry about the volatility of crypto pricing as the cryptocurrencies used for payments are converted into local fiat at the time of sale utrust ultimately helps intertwine cryptocurrencies with fiat and increases the overall usage across the board if we were to see someone like amazon or even walmart adopt you trust for payments which is bound to happen at some point in the future as utrust continues to swallow small to medium-sized businesses market share there really is no telling what the price for you trust could be with an original all-time high of a dollar eighteen and currently trading at just fifteen cents utrust is actually up over twenty eight hundred percent over its low of point zero zero five cents just six months ago when you believe in the fundamentals over flavor of the week opportunities like this present themselves and you trust is just getting warmed up all it would take is one major online e-tailer announcement to drive up the use of utk for a serious moonshot and i believe that day is coming to think of a three and a half dollar to four dollar utk price by the peak of the bull cycle does not sound unreal,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0

yXEHOfZXf-E,I get it because let me tell you who doesn't think it's too late Black Rock BlackRock the world's largest asset manager right around the bottom of the market cycle BlackRock sneakily launched their Bitcoin fund allowing their big money investors to start buying Bitcoin they have now Incorporated Bitcoin as well into the global allocation fund and just remember just remember this insane math just 0.3 percent of blackrock's assets would buy every single Bitcoin currently sitting on exchanges and it's not like they're the only player in the game and remember they also launched this during the bear Market Knowing damn well it was a good time for their big money clients to buy Russia also does not think it is too late they are currently proposing allowing Bitcoin for international trade pretty crazy right and of course what does Russia sell oil and gas could this be the start of the Petro Bitcoin era maybe,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

kSCBl7JVYbk,hey grandma zoom out you're only looking at 2018 look at 2009 look at all the time we've had since 2009 grandma that is what you need to be looking at and Bitcoin in that time in those 10 years is the best performing asset in human history and it has crashed several times tulips did not crash several times and return because I know that your grandpa is gonna tell you that between his tulips and you to tell him hey grandpa tulips crashed and never returned Bitcoin has crashed and returned several times and then your uncle is gonna say hey beacon is worthless I have my Fiat what is the issue why don't we just do fiat transactions they need to tell hey uncle uncle look at my new seller look at financial exclusion this which you need to tell them and that is how you survive the Christmas dinner guys okay have a great day have a great Christmas and we'll bye goodbye goodbye,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
JkZok_f2mQs, hey guys take a look at this chain link just like many cryptocurrencies right now is down 90 from its all-time high it's currently trading at 7.50 cents when this all-time high is over 50. you might be wondering jeb why are we talking about chain link well it just so happens that it is the industry's leading oracle application it brings on chains such as onto ethereum on binance smart chain information that is off chain such as pricing data so if you want to build a dex or any other kind of decentralized application that needs information that's not already native to a blockchain you got to go through chain link or one of his competitors but shane link is in the lead during this bear market we're going to see probably 90 of all coins die,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
JkZok_f2mQs,but i don't think chain link is going to be one i think chain link will come out the other end like a phoenix and rally all the way back to those all-time highs and beyond so might not be a bad idea to put a small percent maybe half a percent or one percent of your portfolio in chain link in speculating that it will do well in the coming bull market that may start in the next year love to hear your thoughts down below peace,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
e0TMH6QoQ9c, hey guys coming at you live with another quick crypto tip if you're ever making a prediction don't just say it's going to 75 000 say if bitcoin breaks 42 thousand dollars then bitcoin will go to 75 000 set it up as an if then statement because then you build in confirmation into your prediction pace,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Rrr5Tw14H9A, right here if you want to send 100 bitcoin then you have to log this in a block you have to log a negative 50 withdrawal on a block and you have to log a 70 bitcoin increase on the blockchain but what lightning network allows you to do is it allows you to take all of these transactions boil them down,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Nls1keqHlz8,guys really quickly want to give you a brief rundown of what bitcoin is and why you might consider buying it if you're showing this to somebody at thanksgiving hi happy thanksgiving really quickly let me give you a definition bitcoin is the first digital verifiably scarce asset in human history what does that mean well i'm gonna break it down really simply for you first and foremost let's talk about the word digital bitcoin being digital means that it exists online it means that it is able to take advantage of all of the amazing things that the internet provides for example you're able to send payments with bitcoin all over the world nearly instantaneously with just a little bit of waiting for the transaction to clear you don't have to worry about things like banks giving you permission to send a transaction it gives it a property called permissionless and you get to reap all of those rewards of the internet now the next part digital verifiably what does verifiably mean well verifiably refers to the blockchain of bitcoin what is that it's a complicated topic i'm trying to keep this video short but basically it is something called a consensus algorithm that uh allows you to be sure that bitcoin has not been hacked been it allows you to be sure that your transaction is actually happening and is not being spent twice in something called a double spend attack it being verifiable means that bitcoin is perfectly secure it is unhackable and in fact bitcoin is the first unhackable or next to unhackable network in the entire world you would need literally hundreds of billions of dollars worth of hardware and equipment to be able to hack bitcoin that's just not realistic so it is digital meaning that it's global on the internet verifiable means that you are able to verify the third component the third component which is called scarce bitcoin has something called scarcity bitcoin will only ever have 21 million bitcoin created so far there's about 18.8 maybe about 18.9 bitcoin a million bitcoin that have been created there will only ever be 21 million which means that it is scarce the reason that's so valuable is because your us dollar has already lost a large amount of its value over just the last 18 months during the thing that i'm not allowed to say on youtube,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Nls1keqHlz8,but we all know has been taking place ever since march of last year really by december of 2019 it being scarce gives it the property of something called saleability over time it allows it to store its value into the future instead of it being inflated for example the us dollar in 19 in 1920 you could buy a comparable home for four and a half thousand dollars that you could buy today for 450 000 bitcoin on the other hand it would be a 4 500 home maybe a 10th of a bitcoin home and then a 10th of a bitcoin home again you don't have to worry about inflation into the future so running through this sentence again digital verifiably scarce asset,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Nls1keqHlz8,what is an asset it just means it's something that you are able to invest in it means that your it is something that you are able to buy and because of all those properties that makes it the first digital verifiably scarce asset in human history and the reason that you should consider buying it is because your united states dollar is constantly losing value bitcoin is the one only and by the way the first answer to that that is built online it's the new age of gold and for that reason i have a large amount of my net worth in gold excuse me in bitcoin in digital gold and i think it's a good idea for everybody to have a little bit have a happy thanksgiving peace,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
GPw3EJsaZdA, what is going on everybody randall here from crypto love today's episode i wanted to make for you a quick video on why you may not want to buy all coins now now it does seem interesting to buy all coins right now because they're down like 99 from all-time highs so what better time could there be to buy all coins well i'm going to share that with you because i saw this video this week i didn't actually watch the video but i saw the title suggesting buying all coins now doesn't seem like a bad idea they're down all times highs bitcoins probably gonna go down lower so maybe a great time to buy but this is my opinion on when the best time to buy all coins is based on bitcoin price because heck if you're going to be buying them with fiat then yeah sure could be a good time to buy them now but if you're buying them with bitcoin definitely not right now and here's why [Music],overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
GPw3EJsaZdA,all right so what i did was i made a chart i went to coin market cap i looked at the bitcoin charts from january 1st 2017 to today and also the total market cap excluding bitcoin from that same date until today so i took a look at the market cap of both of them and as you can see if you take a look at the peak right here okay these are both the same time frame so the peak if they were if they coincided if they go together would be at the same point but if you take a look when i go back and forth you can see the peak moving from left to right from left to right so the peak of the total market cap actually follows the peak of bitcoin now if you're trying to optimize when to actually buy you want to actually buy when the peaks cross so it would be right here when the peaks crossed that would be the optimal time to buy so if you want to know when that is well you could take a look at bitcoin price it was right around here okay,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
GPw3EJsaZdA,so right around this date december 31st the peak was december 17th so we have 14 days different so about two weeks after the peak now what peak are we talking about because we just had another bitcoin peak and all coins didn't do anything well the peak we're talking out about is actually a gigantic bull run which hasn't occurred yet probably is going to occur the end of 2020 beginning of 2021 when bitcoin does its gigantic run-up to whatever it's going to do fifty thousand hundred thousand million would it two million whatever it goes to wait two weeks as bitcoin price starts coming down put your money into alts also soar and then after that once you once you basically make a profit in alts then you know hedge against a giant drop in both of them so go into a stable coin or take your money out into whatever you want or just hold into bitcoin if you're into huddling bitcoin,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
GPw3EJsaZdA,so that's my opinion on when to buy all coins definitely not right now my opinion obviously not financial advice everybody has their own opinion but based mathematically that will get you the most profits based on what happened the previous cycle so thanks for watching guys i hope you enjoyed that make sure you check out the monarch wallet also monarch pay and i'll catch you guys later have a great weekend peace,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
3losUnLGzUI,boom-shaka-laka what is up everybody welcome to this fireside chat where I am going to talk about tezo's alright my thoughts on Tasers now this is one where just kind of hopped into the top 20 on coin market cap out of nowhere particularly if you weren't paying attention but it's not brand new it's not a surprise tezo's had their ico about a year ago so it was a long long time ago they raised some untold amount like hundreds of millions of dollars or over a hundred million dollars and then just had all types of drama a whole shitstorm class-action lawsuits their board had to resign all this crazy stuff and for what well there's got to be something because they got the support of Tim Draper and the Winklevoss twins and so in essence I mean my gut feeling about tezo's is I'm not excited about it that's my gut feeling but let's talk about us figure out what it's doing why what where who how when all that [ __ ] tezo's to begin with mmm basically they're building another block change now right now they're on like a test net data that gets about 40 transactions per second not too fast not too slow not as slow as the theorem but not too fast and basically they're aiming to be a smart contract platform that does not have issues with smart contract bugs and has self-governance,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
3losUnLGzUI,"so how I think of this is like aetherium that already has like quant stamp implemented all right so quant stamp validates the smart contracts make sure there's not issues with them with the addition of something like dashes smart governance so tezo's in essence could just be a theorem qualms stamping - all together all right it's proof of stake you can with 10,000 tezo's you can you can stake them for like 5% annual interest rewards whatever you want to call it I just don't they just don't do anything I mean there's no news ever about tezo's no marketing really shitty marketing very shitty just everything leading up the past year they really have to pull out a lot in order for my opinion in order to succeed because they're being surpassed by so many other projects right now I mean you look at other big projects that have launches that do a lot better tezo's is just like a void there's no information about it all right so my opinion about tezo's is my thoughts just a big blue foam this down thumbs down okay that's it I can't love them all all right",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

octsG2m4IYI, someone posted this yesterday and this is what made my jaw drop the amount of ether that's been created I think in this month I don't know the exact time frame it's relatively short time frame like since the merge has happened but a little bit further ahead was roughly around 3 300. this is the number that they posted online and that's under proof of stake keep that number in your mind 3 300. if we had still had if we were still under the proof of work mechanism the amount of ether that would have been created was roughly around 450 000. once again we normally would have had 450 000 ether created but because we have a proof of stake only 3 300 were created instead,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

B6AJkFecDFg,I just happen to actually have the actual press release I like by Nance you all know that I think by Nance is an incredible platform especially I think that actually one of the best that we have right now we have been waiting for quite some time this was actually rumored to happen sometime last summer that we were going to have a Fiat decrypt pairings through banants it has long been my opinion that when we did get information like this that this would be the start of a new market a new turn in the cryptocurrency space simply because we have seen other cryptocurrency exchanges and now they have fared before and Finance pretty much controls the market for those who are unaware and the fact that they are adding Fiat pairings and have I guess officially added them today for me marks a huge turn in the cryptocurrency space we no longer have to rely in my opinion on other cryptocurrency exchanges that aren't as reliable I have been using bananas for quite some time,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

rD4NtSzZZk0, when we had all-time highs in 2021 i had a lot of people texting me should i buy now is now the time to buy and this is because there's this emotional trigger in a human being's mind when other people are succeeding because they already own crypto and they're riding these all-time highs they don't want to be left out if it keeps going it's just a 100 emotional trigger there's not any data really involved in asking the question should i buy now it's an emotional question extreme fear can be a sign that investors are too worried that could be a buying opportunity so what we're seeing is very simple when there's fear when the emotional side of the brain is saying don't buy historically and this is not financial advice everybody this is data and this is something i've learned in crypto historically that is the time to buy,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

jskIMuGIoqY,so what does this all mean basically which some have been hacked or someone has taken thirty million dollars worth of crypto they haven't said if it was actually what sort of hack if it was internal you know let's just I've obviously checked their balances and there's thirty million dollars missing now this is all pretty casual just to announce that thirty million dollars is missing but let's bring up the charts I'm sure we're sort of down a couple of hundred dollars but let's just remember that so 15 minutes char there so we've only fallen about two hundred dollars and there's some bias I had to step in here whether or not this is the bounce so we have one more leg down back to where we started the breakout yesterday but I just wanted to show you guys that I'm not panicking,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
jskIMuGIoqY,and I don't think this is a big deal at all so check out the the name hack so back in the day here coin check got hacked and there was over five hundred and thirty million dollars of just nem got stolen so look guys in the scheme of things in terms of big hacks in the past putting this into perspective this is pretty tiny so look markets and BOTS and it's the middle of the night over in the US and Europe so look this is kind of when stop losses are gonna get triggered and it's gonna be a bit of just selling here and there's knee-jerk reactions in crypto we know that right through a few of the comments here but this this it's not good just when we were getting a bit of momentum but in this game he things guys thirty million dollars is a drop in the ocean in in crypto market caps and in this game of previous hacks and everything not that relevant so no articles on coin desk no articles on coin Telegraph,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

GUilLtG3K8A, the next 20 years are going to be the most transformative in the history of humanity we're going to see a lot of people trying to compete in every way possible with cardano there's no competition in my opinion there will be applications there will be blockchains out there that could potentially compete with cardano in very specific Niche elements of the market and that's okay but what we're trying to build with cardano is something that is truly capable of taking over the world of decentralized finance and keep in mind it is one of the only decentralized truly decentralized blockchains in existence there's a lot of crap out there that likes to portray itself as decentralized when in fact it's not and as we continue to transition into this bull market,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

Qo97Zkc6Lcw, so here are two things to focus on when a company is reporting earnings what is its expectation the expectation is something that market analysts set for that stock an example can be something like tesla there's an expectation when it comes down to its earning per share and there's an expectation when it comes down to its revenue expectation if it falls above or below can either cause a positive or negative catalyst to that specific stock the second thing you need to know is that it's not just the earnings report but it's actually sometimes the guidance that ends up being even more important i don't know if you've ever experienced this yourself but a company can report positive earnings for that quarter but it can foreshadow or forecast negative guidance for its up-and-coming quarters and the stock can actually drop regardless of what it reported,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

PQ9ZlvxWXcc,but you know there's been a lot of you know spikes and that's essentially what we want to trade it's been in the red mainly for that you know the past four months but that's not too bad i mean we're day trader so we're buying and buying out at the same time it was hitting 52-week lows so with that we thought we had a lot of you know volume to work with it and you know the volume was great today and when I continue to drop were expecting for it to build the support we didn't know if it was going to do today or do it you know tomorrow but likely were able to no no that or figured out that there's going to be a support at 43 and we didn't figure that out all we did was you know we waited for the for the price to start picking up we wanted to see upward momentum to ensure that when we buy in that the stock is going to continue to rise and the only way it has to move is you know up,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
PQ9ZlvxWXcc,so with that being said is you know we waited for the upper mentum we saw that I had a good support at 43 cents once it past 45 cents then that is kind of you know the signal that you know it's going to continue to rise and that's essentially what it did it continued to rise broke 247 resistance broke the 49 resistance actually hit highs of 53 which is actually where it opened today so just created a nice little you know V which is exactly what we want to see when we r de chartres you know we want to make sure that we let the stock drop we buy in and then we write it back up and it worked out perfectly for us today there's a total twenty five percent potential when you traded baths there's a couple members that were able to log in you know they're ten percent profit,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

ORjTRNu0Ejs, trading is gambling if you do not have a full tested and proven to be profitable trading plan that you consistently follow if you do not have that then when you're trading you are gambling you need a statistic advantage that has proven to be profitable in historic data so that you know it has the likelihood of being profitable in the future and that's not all you need it's not just the strategy you need a full plan you need that along with a risk management plan that keeps you emotionless while trading because you will have some losses and you need the discipline and trading psychology to stick to those two things without switching strategies moving stop losses risking more on some trades than you do others things of that nature would all be signs that you're not ready to trade live so right now if you are trading live without a full plan not just a strategy then that would be equivalent to going to Vegas and just spending your money [Music],overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

sE2hHPtNuAY, so let me throw this at you someone posted this question on one of my other videos he said ross i'm learning to trade at the worst possible time we're in a bear market and the market is pretty bearish right now it's pretty weak so to that i said on the one hand yeah the market's cold and i'm not making a lot of money right now but i'm making money so here's the thing if you're a beginner trader is this a good time to learn that's the question and in my opinion it is for two reasons number one as a beginner trader you shouldn't be trading with real money anyways so it doesn't really matter if the market's super hot or super cold in fact if it's super hot you might feel fomo that you're missing all these opportunities because you're trading a simulator secondly by trading in a simulator during a cold market to me it's like the best time to learn because if you can prove profitability in a cold market that is laying a really strong foundation for when things heat up so keep studying,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

u08MZmsvAos, Marquess co-founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management has put forth a simple framework for portfolio management he has suggested investors consider dividing their capital into three buck one for current expenses one to stay rich and one to get rich here is an excerpt from Marc's appearance on the Med Faber show in which he discusses this approach you've got your liquidity bucket and that is to fund the next two years of spending so it should be 10 to 15% that 10 to 15% should be in truly liquid you know cash like on like you know very low risk things because you you're gonna need it to spend and if you spend five percent two years of ten if you spend seven percent a year then two years is fourteen so around to 15 so 10 to 15% in no quiddity bucket then I say everybody should also have a get rich bucket now the get rich bucket I tell people that should be to own pieces of businesses it should be you know income developed you know real estate or whatever but really what people do with that it's they're punting money,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
u08MZmsvAos,it's the hot stock tip from their broker it's the thing they hear on CNBC you know god forbid it's it's the the friends you know condo deal or or you know other friends venture deal and I would say you're gonna lose all that so just keep it small so 10 to 15 percent play money be willing to lose it and if you hit a big home run fantastic if you if you focus on it and you really spend time on it it can be incredibly productive so that get rich bucket has a hole in the bottom and it drips down into the middle which is the biggest bucket 70 to 80 percent which is the stay rich bucket and that stay rich bucket then as a whole on the on one side of it and it drips down into the liquidity bucket so every year you take five to seven percent out of the stairs bucket replenish the liquidity bucket and hope to get rich bucket generates some some good stuff,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
u08MZmsvAos,but in that stay rich bucket that's where it's all about diversification because getting rich is all about concentration every large fortune in the world came from a concentrated position country stock position investments targeting hundred baggers would be in the get rich part of the portfolio remember this is a small part of one's overall portfolio euskal recommends 10 to 15% for getting rich and hundred baggers may only be one part of that they get rich bucket benefits from taking advantage of two key concepts that assist in wealth accumulation first is a long-term outlook research has shown that investments that take more time tend to offer a higher annualized return on average 100 baggers certainly fit in this category second is a concentrated portfolio concentration increases the potential for high returns as well as high losses so it should be done carefully and only with capital that can tolerate that risk 6,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

CGalWMtcU30, short selling traders short sell when they feel the price of something is going to go down in value when a trader sells short he will borrow that item when the price is higher sell it and then later on hopefully after the price has dropped we'll buy it back and return it let's look at a real life example let's say your friend owned a rather large tank of gasoline back when gas was selling for four dollars a gallon let's say you borrowed your friend's gas and then sold it all off for four dollars a gallon now let's say you waited to gasoline prices dropped down to two dollars a gallon and you went and you bought that gas back and returned it to your friend you paid you sold it for four dollars a gallon,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
CGalWMtcU30,but you only paid two dollars a gallon to buy it back so you made two dollars a gallon let's look at the same situation in the stock market let's say you thought the price of a stock was gonna drop in price and the current price was ten dollars a share you would go to your broker and borrow a hundred shares and sell it at ten dollars per share later on after the price of the stock dropped in value to eight dollars a share you buy that stock back and return it to your broker therefore your profit is two dollars a shares the difference between the price you sold it at ten dollars a share and the price you bought it back at eight dollars a share this is also called covering your short in forex things work a little different because there are always two currencies in every transaction you are always longing or buying one of the currencies at the same time as you are selling or shorting the other currency more on that in the next video as we've now covered how short selling works in the markets we are ready to move on to our next video which is how forex transactions work in general,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
aF4FqsunD-I,hi folks David Ryan here again with inform trades dot-com and today's lesson of the day in our last lesson we continued our free stock trading course with a look at exactly what a stock exchange is and some of the main features they aim to provide in today's lesson I'm going to continue this discussion with a look at the oldest exchange in the United States and how it operates the New York Stock Exchange so let's get started the New York Stock Exchange is the oldest Stock Exchange in the United States with history going back all the way to 1792 it was then that 24 traders who had been gathering under a Buttonwood tree on Wall Street in New York signed what became known as the Buttonwood agreement this formalized the relationship between the traders and we've been gathering there to trade stock among one another and stipulated that they would all charge the same commission going forward because of its size and long history many of the country's largest public companies choose to list their shares for trading here in addition to being known for its long history and size however the New York Stock Exchange is also known for its physical location and human involvement in setting the price for stocks at trades and it is these features that is most important for traders to understand while many of the world's exchanges have gone completely electronic the New York Stock Exchange maintains a physical trading floor and people who are known as specialists seek to conduct an orderly market through an open auction process what this basically means is that there is an actual person sitting on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange who is responsible for gauging supply and demand for a particular stock in the market and setting its price based on that supply and demand the fact that these specialists is seeing all of the orders come into the market for a particular security at one time as well as how people around him such as floor brokers which we will learn about in our next lesson are acting gives them a huge edge over the market that is not available to the individual trader in return for this privilege specialists are required to provide liquidity when there are not enough buy and sell orders coming into the market to make a price to do this the specialist holds an inventory of shares and uses this to balance the market when there are not enough buyers and sellers specialists make money by buying at the price where the public is selling referred to as the big price and selling at the price where the public is buying referred to as the offer price and pocketing the difference between those two prices which is referred to as the spread within certain guidelines they are also allowed to take positions in the market which with their inside view of the action can be very profitable it is for this reason that there are many rules relating to how they can do this and also watch specialists also have a bad reputation for trading against their clients that's our lesson for today and our next lesson we'll look at the process a traders order goes through to be executed when trading in a New York Stock Exchange listed stock so I hope to see you in that lesson as always if there any questions or comments please feel free to leave them in the comment section below and good luck with your trading,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
V3JbpTtgzKw,"hi folks David Waring here again with informed trades calm in today's lesson of the day in our last lesson we finished up the first module of our logistics of stock trading course with a look at what an e CN is in today's lesson we're going to start a new module on how to place a stock trade with a look at how to set up our stock trading platform so let's get started for the purposes of this course I've chosen to work with the think or swim platform from what I've seen they are the firm of the best reputation in the market and I especially like the fact that they offer the ability to pay per trade on their platform before going live which is something that many other stock trading firms do not offer so let's start by going to think or swim and registering for a free demo account I've included a link below this video which will take you to the registration page where you can register for your free demo once you're at the registration page fill in the information required and push the register button once you've done this you will be taken to a second registration page where if you'd like to register for a live account you can do so at this time if you prefer to check out the software before opening a live account then you need to check your email and activate the registration form that you just filled out your information will be saved by the system so if you want to try the software out and then come back and finish the account opening process at a later time you can do so to download the software click on the thinkorswim icon in the upper left hand corner of the page and then go to software think desktop this will take you to a page where you can click to download the software and then click install to download the installation file once you've done this you're going to want to save the file to your desktop and then follow the instructions for downloading software once you finish the download process go to start program files and locate the thinkorswim group in your program files click there to launch the login box and then enter your username and password so you can login to the station you now logged into the station and are ready to get started placing some trades on delayed 20 minute quotes with 100,000 and virtual cash that's our lesson for today in our next lesson we will look at how to pull up quotes for different stocks that you want to trade so we hope to see you in that lesson as always if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them in the comments section below and good luck with your trading",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
a2yCIzM5qfE, okay I see you have a moving average line on there and I've seen some of your videos on YouTube you've got a moving average indicator as well how do you sort of use use that on the daily chart I don't pay any attention to moving averages I'm not like a minimum attention but on the five-minute chart I do there are a bunch of the tricks right now I use the 20 bar exponential moving average but it doesn't matter which moving ever to use I have a friend who uses a 34 bar weighted moving average another guy who uses a 10 bar simple moving average it doesn't matter you can see I have a second and a third moving average on the chart this is just a formula an indicated on TradeStation this is the 15-minute moving average showing up on the 5-minute chart this is the 60 minute 20 bar exponential moving average and I wrote it so that it shows up on the 5-minute chart exactly as it would 60 minute chart,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
a2yCIzM5qfE,so I do pay attention to the moving averages because if the market is trending very often moving averages will be resistance for example in my training room today I talked about this bar right here okay there's something very special that happened with this bar all right markets and Big Bear trend and this is the first bar with a low above the moving average so I call that a moving image Kappa usually that leads to a sell-off to test the low of the day so even though at that point the market was rallying as soon as I see a bar with a low above the moving average and a bear trend it usually leads to the sell-off to test the load of the day and then the market usually tries to bottom and we tried to bottom here,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
a2yCIzM5qfE,but ultimately when we broke to the downside whenever there's a strong bait breakout of a reasonable bottom the market usually gets two legs down so as soon as you see this you have to assume that this bottom will not hold that and gravity attempt will be sold and the market will get a second at least aside like down here we've got team arm legs down,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

Jh4JGZxixsc, how to get started in investing with only five dollars and I'm going to explain this to you in under five minutes so I better get started but first off congratulations I'm pumped up for you I'm fired up that you want to take control of your finances you want to build wealth you want to start investing into the markets absolutely fantastic but maybe you're saying well clay there seems to be a problem here because if I only have five dollars but I love Apple's products and would like to buy Apple stock but for example it's like Apple stock costs 100 there's a problem here because I only have five dollars and fair enough but how cool would this be what happens if you could take that five dollars divide by the cost of the stock which in this situation is 100 and then walk away and still be able to buy 0.05 shares that would be pretty cool,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Jh4JGZxixsc,huh you can still get started even if you just have five dollars and buy the stock of whatever company you really like and that is possible assuming you choose the right broker and platform and that is why I would recommend Weeble because they offer what is known as fractional shares so as I just mentioned fractional shares is what we are after and what Weeble offers and as I just showed you with the example and as Weeble advertised by fractions of stocks at a five dollar minimum and then the cherry on top of this or well I should say the first Cherry pay zero dollars in commissions when you trade fractional shares with them and then the other cherry on top is assuming you just have five dollars or smaller amount is Weeble is always offering promotions where if you sign up then they're giving away free stock or free cash it always varies depending on you know the time of year but pointer being my argument would be you know what if you're only getting started with five dollars why not put some more cash quickly in your pocket by getting and taking advantage of a promotion that this broker is offering via the free cash or free stock so I will put a link Down Below in the description section and if you click on that then you'll be able to take advantage of whatever the promotion is full transparency sake that is an affiliate link,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Jh4JGZxixsc,so yes I will get some something also but you will also get something and you know this is why I would argue it's a good thing because you can buy fractional shares they're zero dollar commissions they're giving you money via cash or free stocks it just seems like a whole lot of good things going in your favor as you get started but at the core how do you get started you need to find a platform and broker that offers the ability to buy fractional shares that is a keyword fractional shares get out there and allows you to get started with as little as five dollars,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

3PzT1I52v6s,hey it's clay trader at claytrader.com welcome to rvr trading this course is all about the top question that i get hey where do i buy is it safe to buy is it too late to buy the price is pulled back you think i could buy now the price has been running should i buy or is it too late there's all sorts of variations that revolve around where should i buy but rightfully so because obviously that is a key key component to having a successful trade and then of course you have that well i struggle with where do i sell does it make sense to sell now or should i hold all those questions very valid and that's what this course covers but more importantly it covers the foundational aspect of trading i put it second behind the psychology of trading but that is risk management rvr stands for risk first reward and the course covers how do you put yourself in logical rational trade plans where the risk and reward are balanced like they should be so over here you can see the breakdown of what rvr trading covers and the first thing that i want to cover is that this is for people with a day job or day traders a big thing that i've gotten over the course since i've been doing uh the trainings is hey i have a job do you have anything for somebody like me and it's always been i do,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
3PzT1I52v6s,but you know not specifically well this course finally takes care of that if you have a day job and i literally mean if you can't check the market at all during the day this is a strategy that will help you and is directed to you however if you are able to monitor the market or maybe you're a day trader these principles and these strategies still can apply to you but you know i really want to get across that you could have a day job and not be able to check the the computer the markets at all and this whole strategy these techniques would apply to you the first thing over is just trade plan development you've heard the same before or if you haven't it's only a matter of time plan the trade and trade the plan but you really know how to plan the trade that's what this course is going to cover and i go over that in great detail,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
3PzT1I52v6s,and then we break that down into three further techniques the panic buy the momentum buy and the speculation buy and then at the end of the day the goal of the course is to put yourself where a trade could go minimally wrong or massively right so i mean really think about that if you're sitting in a trade if your plan revolves around an entry point and everything else that goes with it which will be covered in the course but at that point in time if you know that you're sitting at a spot where things could just go minimally wrong or massively right you know you're in a great situation and that's what this course all revolves around putting yourself in favorable risk versus reward setups and patterns if there are any other questions on the course please reach out to me let me know,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
3PzT1I52v6s,and i will do the best to answer them but in a nutshell all this is covered through video you get my personal spreadsheet that helps run these calculations and tells you is it logical or is it stupid and that comes with the course but it's not an ebook nothing like that all videos and then you do get my one spreadsheet again let me know if you have any questions and i hope to help you with your rvr trading,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

mvvPxlaaFcA,and then you fill in the blanks some sort of time frame and my answer is always the same I don't care why don't I care because if the market goes down I can still make money how is this possible with shorting and that's why I wanted to develop this course and this is why I'm so just enthusiastic towards teaching people how to short because it gives you flexibility if there's one thing as humans we want options choices why do you think buffets are so popular because you can walk up there and there's all sorts of food with stock shorting you can look at a stock sit back and say you know I don't think this price is going to go up and a lot of people when they reach that conclusion they say well I have to go find one that I do think is going to go up in our case as shorter's we can say hey I think it's going to go down great,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
mvvPxlaaFcA,I can still make money and that's a nice spot to be in but the best spot is just from a psychological level sit back relax and don't worry about what the markets going to do in the next week month year two years ten years because whatever is going on we're going to be able to adapt as traders to the environment and if it's embarrassed environment than hey we're just going to have to be short biased and take advantage of that now with the shorting for profit course what that is I cover five different strategies all of ones that I use in my trading I break them down step by step by step so when you're done you're going to not only know how to implement and execute the strategy you're also going to have plenty of examples to see it happen you know in a real-life type situation so there's going to be plenty of examples there's plenty of details if anything I may annoy you with amount of details I put in there in terms of the step-by-step strategy but I just want to make sure that nothing gets left out,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
mvvPxlaaFcA,so if there are any other questions on the course please let me know but again you know don't be one of those people that's always nervous and just stressing out about the future join the short side add shorting to your toolbox and become a truly well-rounded traitor,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

MLZjmHuNfbc,hey this tv it's 3d i want to buy it more money and it's just going to keep going on and on and on and such is psychology however when it comes to human emotion this is not the case humans have will and will always be the same when it comes to psychology fear greed panic excitement boredom anger always going to be part of human nature and that's where charts and that's the power of technical analysis it helps us to read the emotion feelings and psychology of not only the market but stocks bonds forex options futures anything that has psychology and emotion a part of it charts are used to measure it and that's why technical analysis is such a powerful tool and that's why when you understand emotions you can eliminate your own because you sit back and say oh i understand how the market's feeling right now therefore i'm going to act like this or oh the market's feeling like this the market is experiencing this type of emotion,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
MLZjmHuNfbc,i see that therefore i need to act like this by understanding charts that's how you can sit back form strategy develop rules and you're going to sit back with no stress you're going to sit back understanding what's going on understanding why the price is acting like it is and sit there and know should i make a move right now or shouldn't i that's a pretty powerful spot to be in that's not a very stressful spot think about it the only time you're stressed out is when you feel like you're cornered and don't know what to do adrenaline starts to flow but when you can eliminate your emotions it's going to eliminate all of your stress and on top of that the most important thing it's going to give you consistency robotic trading starts from square inch,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
MLZjmHuNfbc,one so if you're saying i don't know what a chart is perfect because the very first video is literally what is a chart and from there it builds and builds and builds and then at the end you know we're talking about advanced concepts such as fibonacci analysis so don't get uh you know scared away because you think oh this is going to be too complicated i don't know enough it assumes you don't know anything it assumes you don't even know what a chart is so rest assured the course is designed for the people that have no idea maybe you have a little idea course is still designed for you and just to kind of summarize this whole point about human emotions never change charting never changes this course has been available since 2008 when i created it i've sort sold over a thousand courses and people still say hey it helped me out why is that the case well we've already been over that because emotions don't change this is not going to be something like a tv where you buy it and then two years from now oh great the markets are totally different everybody is now feeling different i have to go buy another course that's not how we how it works you're buying human emotion which does not change you're not buying a tv here,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

e4Lb1MfjtnU, good afternoon uh friends of trade ideas welcome to monday i'm just showcasing uh the improved interface on our races and the smooth transitions but also showing you what they bring up and why this is the view that is dominating active trading again simply because it helps you to see where the leadership is and of course you can adjust this for prices of you know your lead your preferred price or volume in this case what i'm doing is i don't discriminate against lower price stocks i'm looking for the percentage gainers so let's take a look at them here's pypd still number one 4.3 percent since the race started but clovis oncology which i put an order in is really having a nice day where it came up pulled back and is now trying to go again and this is the example of having yourself be focused look at these moves and the percentages this is the key you know,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
e4Lb1MfjtnU,and this is why we also have tesla apple and the spiders here so that you can have some relativity and see how do they compare to the stocks that are actually moving so tesla for example you know it's up one point three three percent today overall on three point eight six dollars in gains but remember it's a three hundred dollar stock so you're not going to be able to leverage your capital as much with a tesla versus a pypd which is up 22 percent okay so it's a percentage game for us and that is what we're bringing to the table and this is the view we hope you enjoy it have a great day and please don't forget to visit us at www.tradeashideas.com and subscribe,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
4PBlqnM0kws, hello Barry Anderson from trade ideas with today's edition of what makes this trade great well I sort of lyt if you haven't seen nyt in the past um I have to show you a daily chart you may not believe it if you haven't seen this one so three days ago this was a 42 dollar stock okay and then all day long it just absolutely collapsed now listen this was a a very cheap IPO not very many shares were issued I was I can't remember what the IPO price was it was probably about four or five and this is what can happen to some of these crazy crazy ones that have that are IPOs very few shares issued low price and they can go really ballistic I mean this got all the way up to forty seven dollars what surprised me actually let me get rid of my Sounds here what surprised me actually was the fact that it had this run multi Days,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
4PBlqnM0kws,A lot of times what we'll see is we'll see maybe three days and then then the fizzle this took you know this actually was up one one two three four five six seven eight days and then look at this drop though forty one dollars all the way down to five dollars the same day anyway this kept showing up all my race is right here lyt okay you know I've been following the races and so there it is lyt in the pull position the number one leader today with four races one so was watching this all day long and have traded in and out of it several times uh this is not easy you know and as I said in the room this is highly highly speculative look at these topping tails look at the bottoming Tails but here's the deal if somehow this can take out and I have to back up I'll show you my daily chart on this one again you can see right here this is um what three days ago right there the high was 640.,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
4PBlqnM0kws,you know if it can take out 640 and it may not happen today it may never happen but if it does take out 640 Traders are going to be looking at this uh this area up here at 42. I'm not I'm not even suggesting it's going to come close to getting back up to 42. but they're going to just look at this and say man look at this potential void I mean even if it moved two or three dollars that would be a great percentage move so uh what I would do is I would put a price alert at that at that alert price of 640 if you're using trade ideas or some other platform put a price alert at 640 and if it takes it out you know Traders are going to be looking at that next high looking left so anyway that is that's what made it great,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
4PBlqnM0kws,it was the fact that it was winning races uh was a race leader for the day and again not easy chopping up and down not unlike the market I mean look at the market market uh you know went up look at this this red candle here at one point that was green and then it just collapsed 45 minutes a little pop up a little base a little move down a lot of chop of course it's Canada day today uh for we Canadians and of course Fourth of July the Market's closed on Monday so you know we did I actually had a lot more action than I thought I would I thought I thought maybe it would be very very slow but actually a little more action than I thought than I thought we'd see today based on the two holidays anyway that is it guys so in the email that you're getting um you will see there is a promo code for the Fourth of July you'll see it and that is probably good until Tuesday night okay I know it probably says Monday,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

iH2YDax3Awk, hi friends if you're somebody out there that's trying to make sense of charts and doesn't really know where to start or what indicators they might want to use let me show you the only two indicators that i use and they might be the only two indicators you'll ever need what they are is the 10 sma all right on a 15 minute chart,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
iH2YDax3Awk,so it's very important it's a 15 minute time frame we have to use this time frame this 10 sma gives me a gauge of momentum and right now it's showing us that the queues are in a momentum mode as they have not posted a single close below the 10 sma the second indicator you see on here is the 130 or put easily a five-day moving average viewed on a 15-minute chart the way in which you can recreate this is simply go to your indicators no matter what charting platform you use grab a simple moving average and put 130 periods in there that will actually divide perfectly into five trading days and give you 130 candle averages which is the five minute uh five period moving average i should say take note of how much information this simple pair of indicators gave us over the last few days all right nasdaq cues spy they all did the same thing they gapped up yesterday pulled back and where did they find support right here,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
iH2YDax3Awk,so this is what we call a level of interest whether you're a day trader or a swing trader this level should give you an opportunity to make some decisions today and yesterday we have a full momentum move going it's rare to see these things go for longer than a day and a half so what we've got is a super power move going uh in the nasdaq and they're especially in the small caps small caps are on fire today maybe you watch the arc fund i'm sure that one's doing well exactly followed the perfect 10 sma yesterday and is now testing it again so again if you're having a hard time figuring out how to read charts and what indicators to use i suggest trying this little pair of indicators here the 10 sma and the 130 sma only on a 15 minute chart good luck and don't forget to manage risk,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
AHWaqfpncqE, good day subscribers thank you so much for joining me today on the financial education Channel so today we're talking about what is a mutual fund a mutual fund is money that is pulled together by regular investors so it can be anybody and that money is managed professionally by a few managers and a lot of researchers and basically what their goal is is to get you a good return on your investment now you buy shares in a mutual fund,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
AHWaqfpncqE,so if the shares of a certain mutual fund or $50 a share and you have $100 to spend you'll be able to buy two shares in that those shares will go up or down in price as a percent the same percent that they can get as a return on investment now if they get a five percent return your shares in that mutual fund might only go up four percent or so because they take out money because they ought to pay themselves and whatnot so if there's if they get a five percent return you might only see a four percent return on your shares of that mutual fund now a mutual fund is only basically trying to get the same percentage return as the stock market is doing the sp500 or whatever other benchmark they're using could be the Dowell 30 a lot of times it's SP 500 most cases sometimes it's a Russell 2000 there so if the SP 500 goes up 8% that mutual fund all they're basically trying to do is also get an 8% return so they're not necessarily trying to beat it or look extraordinary if they do that's great,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
AHWaqfpncqE,but basically they're just trying to do as good as the markets doing that's where it differs from like a hedge fund where a hedge fund is taking a lot more risk and they're trying to get better returns and what the markets getting so ahead a hedge fund manager is really trying to outdo the market I'm really trying to beat it easily that way they can look extra good,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
AHWaqfpncqE,but at the same time sometimes they can fail horribly because they take a lot more risk and they go a lot bigger into some openes and whatnot where the mutual funds really diversified they really spread their money around that way like I said they're just trying to do as good as a market does or as bad as a market does so if the market goes down 8% they want to go down 8% as well they don't want to go down 15% of 20% where as a hedge fund may actually do that so that is the basics of what a mutual fund is if you have shares or not shares if you have a 401k at your workplace they're probably invested in a mutual fund of some kind and so basically your money just does as good as the markets doing and what on it so that's a mutual fund thank you so much for watching guys subscribe if you like this thumb it up if you haven't subscribed you may wanna I'm just trying to lift everybody's financial education up one day at a time thank you guys have a great day,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

WTqUBrYms-M,the first part I explained on like changing your psychological mindset a lot of people are in the mindset that they don't have to sell in life and the fact is if you want to get anywhere you want to go in life you have to know how to sell there's no other way around it look at anybody you've ever looked up to in life they are all phenomenal at selling they either had to sell the idea out there they had a sell you know what their company's about so they could raise funding they had a sell a product or service because there are actual sales men anyone you've ever looked up to in like their greatest sales if they got that part in that role if they you know made it in the music industry guess what they're all good at selling they were all good at marketing themselves,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
WTqUBrYms-M,okay anyone you ever looked up to so that's why I create this this course so the first part is all I'm changing your psychological mindset around that the second part is called the four levels of selling that it take you through in how a sales process goes whether you're trying to sell a product or service or whatever you're trying to do I take you through those four levels I like to call it and the last part is my five top tips I could ever give someone out there for selling guys because it's literally a life-changing thing once you know how to sell you can get somewhere so much faster in life the people that don't know how to sell they're really left behind guys so I thought this was the best present I could possibly ever give you guys and so I hope you enjoy it so anyways I'm gonna get back now to it I'm gonna get back to fixing this office up and getting it all all you know looking great and whatnot but anyways I hope you guys absolutely enjoy that the present from you guys it is link down there in the the comments office is a pin common join there and once again it's free three-part course so hope you guys love it let me know some feedback on it and you know what guys have a rates day,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

rU1k6Xz6W5M, what is the difference between a savings account in a CV account today I'm going to explain those differences I cannot wait hello subscribers thank you so much for joining me today on the financial education channel so today we're talking about the difference between a savings account and a CD account and it's pretty simple the difference between the two first let's talk about a savings account so a savings account is it account you make either through a bank or credit union and you get a small amount of interest on the money you have in your account and generally you can put in whatever amount of money you want it to that savings account,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rU1k6Xz6W5M,so you put 25 bucks in there 100 bucks in there or you can have a certain amount come out of each paycheck you get so when your paycheck goes into your checking account you're gonna have you know $25 always come out of it or you can just decide what you want to go into your savings account and it's you would link it to your checking account so you can pull money from there and put money into that account and things like that now where differs from a CD account is a CD account is basically a locked-in account so meaning the money you have in that account you can pull it out but if you pull it out early you lose all the interests you had been making on that so a CD account is almost always you're gonna make more as a percent on your money in a CD account versus a savings account for that very reason a CD count is really designed for the money to be locked in there and you will get a better percentage on your money depending on how much money you have for that CD account so like generally ten thousand or a hundred thousand or a million dollars in a CD account you can get three four five percent on that and then they want you to lock it in for four or five years maybe even more than that so you can't really touch that money for all that time you can,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rU1k6Xz6W5M,but like I said you lose your interest if you touch it so you know you really just want to leave it in there and a CD account worst I said with a saving account you can move things in and out and you just get a very very very small amount of interest on your money in a savings account I hope this explained very easily what a CD account and a savings account what the differences are that's really the only difference is between the two pretty simple right well the simplest videos I've ever done thanks for watching guys subscribers as always thank you and if you have fam friends or family that maybe they don't know the difference between these two go ahead and show the video with them thanks guys have a great day [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause],overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

jTHoIEFAu1g, i feels welcome to another video from The Motley Fool I'm Owen been alack now loads are spinning off tsb we've already seen it in the High Street TSP branches popping up everywhere now it's going to take that Bank and stick it on the stock market has to do this the European Commission has given it to the end of 2015 to spin off the bank so it's going to I p oh it's going to float it on the london stock market i'm going to buy shares in to SB i'm going to subscribe for shares in this I here,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
jTHoIEFAu1g,and I'm going to tell you why there are four reasons why I think this is actually quite a good deal unlike most ideas which are generally pretty lousy deals and for reasons the first reason is that Lloyd's looks like it's going to have to sell up this Bank pretty cheap at least initially it's going to sell twenty five percent bitshares initially and the range of prices currently is 220 pedes 290 p now in the middle of that range at 255 p that is less than the value that tsp is curry on the books of Lloyd's so they're having to sell it as a bit of a discount even a few weeks ago they didn't think this was going to be the case that things got a little bit rocky in the IPO market so Lloyd's is going to have to sell it a little bit cheaper it looks like that's already quite a good reason to invest in my view secondly this is a very very safe Bank this Bank has stacks and stacks of cash once it's floated the capsule core tier 1 capital ratio will be about seventeen percent the average UK banks core tier 1 capital ratio is about ten to twelve percent,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
jTHoIEFAu1g,so you can see there's a massive divergence there where the bank is much more loaded up the capital that makes it safer and also gives a lot supply power to expand and grow which is going to need to do to grow profits but it's got the firepower to do it thirdly,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
jTHoIEFAu1g,"and I've already alluded to this modes is a force seller Lloyd's can't look and go on the market a bit soft for IPOs let's put this off until next year lads it has to sell it has to take this back to the market that is completely the opposite of the general situation with IPOs which is when people who own the company maybe the founders or private equity or whatnot go are this is a good chance to sell it to a bunch of suckers at a profit they timed perfectly Lloyd's isn't doing this because it thinks it's a good time to sell the bank it's doing because it has to solve the bank again that implies price is likely to be cheaper than it should be in normal market conditions that's another bit of wind blowing in our favor finally you get free shares if you're a private investor and you subscribe up to 2,000 pounds for the IPO you will get given 1 share for every 20 you hold for a year",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
jTHoIEFAu1g,"so it's up to 2,000 pounds you don't get it if you're fat cat and you put in 50 K but fits up to 2 K you get 1 share for every 20 that you hold provides you're holding for a year that is equivalent to five percent uplift after year so you basically know that if you hold on to the bank you'll get a five percent so what have we got there we've got cheap we've got very safe we've got four seller so likely a bargain we've got free shares and that is a deal",overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
VcvnvVKt3OY,hi everybody Jason Moser here analyst with Motley Fool one thanks for joining us for another edition of ask a fool but today we're taking a question from erica Johnson and Erica asks what are some good stocks to get started for small started in and for small time investors I've read that two hundred dollars per stock is a good price point to aim at is that good advice a couple of questions there Erica and I'm happy to answer them both but when you're looking at stocks to buy whether you're looking at investing in stocks or mutual funds or index funds the primary focus needs to be on minimizing your transaction costs once you've found an investment you want to be a part of make sure the transaction costs and that's the amount that your online brokerage will charge you to buy or sell the stock make sure that cost doesn't exceed two percent of your total purchase it's a good rule of thumb that we use and it helps protect your returns and keep you from paying too much nowadays many brokerages offer Commission free trading with certain balances or other qualifiers so definitely investigate that by checking out our brokerages section to fool calm and the way to get there is from the varied from the front page of fool comm check out to find a broker link under the how to invest tab and that will guide you through to help you show to help you find the different different types of brokerages that are out there so let me give you an example my accounts are actually with Scott trading scottrade charges a seven dollar transaction fee whenever i buy or sell a stock so for me to keep within that two percent threshold I want to make sure that I invest at least three hundred and fifty dollars at one time two percent of $350 seven dollars and so that keeps me within that threshold now if you have an account where the Commission is zero,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
VcvnvVKt3OY,well then you don't have to worry about this because two percent of zero is still zero that's the way you want to approach this question make sure you are minimizing your transaction costs and that will help you over time save from paying too much it'll protect your returns now as far as good stocks for beginning investors you know there are a lot of different ways you can go with that we talked about this kind of stuff that stock advisor all the time but really you know whether it's stock advisor I mean one of my investing heroes is Peter Lynch and he's always taught us to invest in things that we understand and so I think if you can follow that rule of thumb invest in companies and businesses that interest you busy is that you understand that you see every day I think that's a great way to get started,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
VcvnvVKt3OY,and so some of the low-hanging fruit there you could look at things like Starbucks perhaps Google perhaps amazon or Apple those are for great companies that we cover in our Foolish universe that we're very positive about today and as long-term investors they're a great place to start but definitely you can find out more ideas if you just go check out fool com that's what we're here for so thanks again for the question and for more information don't forget to check out fool com,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0

KObPgqlOXOs,so I just throw darts but me too that doesn't always work so a lot of the time I put it like this is that the longer you've spent investing the less time you need on each new idea so you look at someone like Warren Buffett he can very decisively move in with a lot of cash and say I'm gonna invest in this distressed bank but that's because he's been looking at this Bank off and on for 50 years literally if you are looking at a company for the first time you're gonna need to spend more time on that the nice thing is the more time you spend in the market the less time you need so Truman this that's basically my thinking exactly - and Joe and I have fairly similar approaches sometimes James it's maybe there's not enough days in a month we're just cranking through stocks,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
KObPgqlOXOs,and you value something you hope it's gonna come out well it doesn't over and over and over other days I've got this rolodex of names in my head I know what will make me like a certain stock that happens so boom is just a day it really varies but we do have that a sort of bench of years of knowledge spinning on these stocks and we also have analysts to help us - so it's it's kind of all over the map the main thing is just getting the stock done right yeah and I think one thing we're big fans big fans up here is using a watch list so when I started at The Fool I was amazed at a lot of games like James bill man have these huge mental rolodexes of companies you know,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
KObPgqlOXOs,and there's an idea for every type of theme or macro situation different degrees of leverage within all of those and so that's the kind of thing that just comes with experience but a great way to start working towards that is to just start putting together like an Excel spreadsheet with your favorite companies in terms of like competitive advantage products that you love and just watching them over time and you'll get to know them better and as they get cheap or do something really well that you're excited about you'll be more ready to pounce when the time comes all right James I hope that answers your question and thanks to you and thanks to all who watched if you liked more just go to fool.com thank you people on the show may have interests in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
VAQrf07AnoM, so will there be a second stimulus check well with new states announcing closures every single day the topic of a second stimulus check is coming up again but right now congress is completely divided the democrats want to pass a 2.2 trillion dollar stimulus package while republicans want to spend just 500 billion now both sides are in favor of things like additional ppp money as well as stimulus checks being sent out to low-income americans however one of the sticking points right now is the added unemployment benefits democrats are in favor of the supplemental unemployment aid meanwhile republicans feel this disincentivizes returning to work so overall with cases skyrocketing right now and new closures being announced daily a second stimulus check is very likely but it's not going to happen until congress can come together,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

s27-UKEqN4I, in this video we look at stock beta and what is it used for I also have a word of caution when it comes to stock beta at the end of this video okay let's get started what is a stock beta stock beta measures the movement of a stock versus that of the stock market another way to put it is that it measures how a stock responds to a move in the stock market let's look at a quick example we have three different stocks we're looking at stock 1 stock 2 and stock 3 stock 1 has a beta of one stock 2 has a beta of 0.5 stock 3 has a beta of 1.5,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
s27-UKEqN4I,so what does this mean let's imagine the stock market moves up 10% while stock 1 which has a beta of 1 should move up the same 10% what about stock 2 well with beta 1 is considered the baseline you could look at it as a hundred percent of the move of the market will be reflected in this stock if the stock has a beta less than 1 it will have a less traumatic move if this stock has a beta of more than 1 it will have a more drastic move than the stock market so back to our example stock 2 has a beta of 0.5 this means that it should only move half of what the stock market did or 50% which in this case would be 5% stock 3 has a beta of 1.5 so stock 3 will move more than the market did stock 3 should be up 15 percent or 50 percent more than the market well what if the market was down 10% stock 3 with a beta of 1.5 should now be down 50% more than the market or 15% down while stock 2 should only be down 5% or half of the market beta is used in a few different ways it can be used in the capital asset pricing model often called cap n to obtain the cost of equity I'll be doing a video on cap m at some point in the future I've also seen entire portfolios designed to hold low beta stocks with the idea that they should be less volatile from the market and in theory more stable one word of caution stock beta is a historical measure just because it has a low beta today doesn't mean it will have a low beta tomorrow,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

cjlCfhR4zIM,"in this video we're going to look at the basics of a bond what it is and how you can make money investing in it we're gonna look at two real-life examples one from Nike and one from Kroger a bond is a loan you make to the company let's look at some examples here are the details for a Nike bond and here are the details for a Kroger bond we're gonna keep this simple let's imagine you're going to invest $1,000 worth of each bond here's an overview of how a typical bond would work when a bond is first issued it has on it what is called par value or face value typically that's a hundred or thousand dollars so let's imagine you invest a thousand dollars on that day in return what you will receive is interest payments usually twice a year let's assume the coupon rate on that bond is 10 percent that would mean if you invest a thousand dollars you would receive $100 a year or $50 every six months that's typically the way it works twice a year you would receive this until the maturity date were on the maturity date in addition to your final interest payment you would receive back the par value of the bond in this case a thousand dollars so in looking at the Nike bond the three point eight 75% tells you that for the thousand dollars invested you would receive thirty eight dollars and seventy five cents for the kroger bond the seven point five percent coupon tells you would receive seventy-five dollars a year if you look at the price of each the Nike bond is trading at one hundred and two point four while the kroger bond is trading at one hundred and thirty point three why the difference people have flooded into the kroger bond that is paying seven and a half percent the more people that buy it the higher the price goes so what does this mean for you as an investor the hundred and thirty point three means it would cost you one thousand three hundred and three dollars for the same thousand dollars worth of a bond while the Nike bond will cost you one thousand twenty four dollars the advantage of buying the kroger is if you pay thirteen hundred and three dollars you will receive 75 dollars a year versus the thousand twenty four dollars for Nike we are only going to receive thirty eight seventy five a year no matter what the price you pay you're going to receive the interest payments based on the par value of the bond and at the end of the bond when the bond matures you're going to receive back that par value also known as the face value that's the purpose of investing in bonds it's steady it's consistent and in theory it's safer than stocks if you have any questions about the world of investing any suggestions on videos please post in the comments below and please subscribe as we continue to update with new videos every week thank you",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Kd-ZZMxFqZM,"a mutual fund is sometimes called a pooled investment vehicle because it pulls money together from many investors it is generally managed by a professional investor called the portfolio manager the portfolio managers job is to select and monitor the individual investments for the fund's shareholders the price of a mutual fund is calculated by adding up the value of all the funds investments and dividing it by the number of shares outstanding this is called net asset value or nav let's look at a hypothetical example ABC investment company launches a mutual fund this specific mutual fund is only going to invest in environmentally friendly companies you read through their perspectives to determine if you want to invest in it a prospectus is a document that every mutual fund manager must make available to investors it describes the strategy these investment objectives and many other important details of the fund after reviewing the prospectus you determine you want to invest you decide you want to invest $1,000 worth of this fund the price of the mutual fund is updated each business day and will reflect the value of the funds investments so if the stocks that the fund owns rise in value the price of the fund will also rise in value [Music] for minimal investment investors get their investments managed by a professional investor diversification since mutual funds generally invest in many individual companies bonds or other securities the risk of owning a single investment is reduced when it comes time to buy or sell a mutual fund it is rather quick and easy for the individual investor this allows you to more closely manage your own investments next week we are going to look at setting up a portfolio we are going to walk through everything from having cash in your savings account to moving it into a brokerage account and placing your first traits if you have any questions about the world of investing any suggestions on videos please post in the comments below and please subscribe as we continue to update with new videos every week thank you",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

sCNVuaQuFcU,a tariff is essentially a tax on goods and services that are imported the purpose of a tariff is generally to protect the product or a service that is domestically produced here the basics of how a tariff might work let's imagine that country a produces widgets and country B produces similar widgets country B is able to produce their widgets for ten dollars each while in country a it cost them fourteen dollars to produce their widgets well in an effort to get more business the manufacturers in country B decide to sell their widgets in country a for just thirteen dollars a widget as you can imagine this isn't good for the manufacturers in country a now they can't sell their widgets for a profit well business begins to slow for the manufacturers in country a and because business is slowing they must let go of some of their workers well the government in country a doesn't like this so they decide to impose a tariff on all widgets that are imported into country a from country B they are going to charge five dollars per widget to all imports well now the manufacturers in country a are thrilled they can sell their widgets for let's say fifteen dollars a widget and the competitors in country B can't beat their price so that is essentially how a tariff works now the real question is is this good or bad well for the widget manufacturing country a it's a great thing they were losing money before with no real way to compete but now they're selling the widgets again for a profit and they can hire again in their businesses growing so what about potential negatives well one potential negative is retaliation by country be perhaps country B is upset by this widget tariffs and perhaps they put their own tariffs on let's say chickens that are imported into their country from country a and also let's imagine that there's a lot of chickens that gets shipped from country aid to country B,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
sCNVuaQuFcU,well this could be the beginning of a trade war a no vote and often takes a long time for trade Wars to play out there tends to be many losers and only a few winners in a trade war another consideration is the end user you might hear an argument saying something like that country a manufacturers were taken off the hook instead of country a manufacturers having to innovate or cutting costs to compete with the manufacturer in the country B instead the government stepped in so what about the end user the people or companies that bought those widgets before used to pay just $13 per widget thanks to the imported widgets but now it's costing them $15 a widget which makes their expenses higher so our tariffs good or bad well you decide since it seems that the answer to that question depends on who you ask,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
WQzwXk1XqQk, how much money do you actually need to be able to retire early here's a very simple rule of thumb take whatever monthly income you want to be able to retire off of and multiply it by either 200 or 300. if you want to have 5 000 per month to retire that leaves you around three thousand eight hundred dollars after taxes of passive income which is really awesome now if you wanted that five thousand dollars per month with the rule of 200 you would need one million dollars the rule of 200 says that you'll earn about a six percent rate of return on your million dollars and so with the rule of 200 you have a million dollars invested as long as you're making six percent on your money you'll get your 5 000 a month and you won't be cutting into that original million dollars if you make more that number goes this of course is when you switch to the enjoyment phase of life and you go from the grind phase or the income and wealth building phase into the preservation phase and the passive income phase of life,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
cJk3JnqC4sQ,five tips for a higher credit score number one change your behavior show the algorithm show the computers that you're changing your behavior and you're actually a lower risk here's an example of that if you usually pay your bills the day they're late or would be late like the 15th of the month maybe move that up to the first or pay twice pay on the first pay again on the 15th maybe even pay three times and pay again on the 23rd that way you're showing the algorithm that you are ready to pay down your debt and you're doing so more frequently number two don't do sudden negative actions like all of a sudden putting a two thousand dollar charge on a card when you don't usually do that and have a history paying that off number three never miss a payment make sure this is why so important you write down everything that has your social security number whether it's utility bills or credit cards pay it off at least twice a month that way it's really hard to miss a payment and turn autopay on autopay and check them twice a month stay under a 30 utilization as tip number four that means if you have a ten thousand dollar credit limit don't spend more than three thousand and keep your older cards just make sure you use them every so often because if you don't they could close down your old credit cards deleting that good history and that history is really nice to boost your credit score and lower your utilization follow for more or go to bedcam.com,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

8poZ0WqSsMI, let me share a story with you today about a man who went from absolutely nothing to accumulating more than eight million dollars over his lifetime this is a story of Ronald Reid this is a man who after World War Two worked for 25 years as a gas station attendant and then later on in his life he worked as a janitor at JC Penney so this is a really inspiring story this is something that I heard a few years ago and I wanted to share this with you because it brings up a lot of points and I think the biggest point that brings up here is that you don't need to be some bigwig on Wall Street or a doctor or a lawyer or someone who's making a half a million dollars a year in order to become financially free and wealthy so that's the point of this video I want to bring this across to you if you find this video to be helpful in any way don't forget to drop a like and leave a comment down below on what you would do if you had eight million dollars,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
8poZ0WqSsMI,so how exactly did somebody work as a janitor and go from zero dollars to eight million dollars over his lifetime that's we're gonna find out in this video we have to pick this part a little bit to understand what happened here so ronald read a lot of his life he invested into the stock market now when most people think of the stock market you're thinking 0 to 8 million there's thinking man he's also gotten some really really nice stock he must be some stock whiz or something but in reality he had about 95 different stocks so he had a very diversified portfolio and a lot of these stocks were very common companies a lot ease where blue chip stocks like Dow Chemical and General Electric back in his heyday JCPenney coca-cola PepsiCo there's a whole list of these different stocks at that Ronald riend owned that I'm gonna leave a link down below that has the CNBC article about this this man and how he really did this I'm gonna leave a link for it and it does show some of the stocks that he owned as well,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
8poZ0WqSsMI,but it's a very very interesting story because what this really proves it proves two points first of all you don't need to be some bigwig with a lot of money in order to accumulate a lot of money over your lifetime but it also proves the point that you don't need to be some you know super intelligent stock whiz in order to be able to accumulate wealth as well so Ronald Reid he ran extremely diversified portfolio he could have essentially put his money into something like the S&P 500 or some other type of stock market index and grown his money almost equally as well so this is what's so interesting about it and it's it's the fact that you don't need to be somebody special in order to do this and I'm saying that Ronald Reid wasn't Specialties a very intelligent man I'm sure but it proves that you you can start with almost nothing and you can grow a fortune over your lifetime and so that's what I want to share with you today just this really quick story,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
8poZ0WqSsMI,and it's very inspiring because there's a lot of people who comment on some of my old videos and they'll say you know what need a cool video but I don't have any money I'm working at 7-eleven I can't do this it's just not possible I'm you know it's it's physically not possible for me and I totally understand that but I think starting just so small starting just so incredibly small even with the Robin Hood app starting with five dollars five dollars a day five dollars a week and you can accumulate wealth over your lifetime and so that's the biggest point here you just gotta start young start early and do it for a long period of time and don't trade too often unless you're into that kind of stuff and you're a day trader if you're investing for the long term make sure you're actually holding those stocks for a long time,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
8poZ0WqSsMI,and you know there's give me some turbulence within the markets but people like Ronald Reid he wasn't cashing in during the recession and during times when they were possible trade Wars or stagflation or other problems within the economy he was holding with it for the long term and that's what's really really important for this so thanks so much for watching really quick video I just wanted to bring this across to you guys because I think it's pretty inspiring pretty cool so I'll see you next time [Music],overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

1Pb8FnAUjso,realize that there is a over-the-counter stock called the tweeter Home Entertainment Group the simplest twtr q this isn't twitter this is a company that file for bankruptcy back in two thousand seven unfortunately whenever twitter made the announcement that they were filing IPO people went out and start buying this stock by the droves and guess what happened they didn't make any money they didn't get the twitter IPO they got some stock that was worthless don't be one of those people don't be a bad investor for those of you that are interested in getting in the twitter IPO realize that most likely it ain't going to happen you're not going to get any Twitter IPO why is that it's because you don't have deep pockets it's because you don't have a lot of moolah and to get into an IPO that's what you need you to be working with an investment banker someone really in wall street that has the inside scoop to get in on it how much Twitter IPO my getting nothing nada I'm not that special either even though I'm in the financial services industry getting an IPO is really really difficult,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

1Pb8FnAUjso,I know that's not that exciting don't get struck by lightning not cool the exact same thing happened with the facebook IPO a lot of people want to get in before I hit the secondary market and guess what they didn't get in either you have to wait until hits a secondary market which leads me to the next point of how you actually get into Twitter stock how are you actually going to buy it you have to wait until it gets into the secondary market what that means is after the IPO after it hits the market that's when you're allowed to buy it obviously the big risk and waiting to the secondary market is that the stock could shoot up so by the time a hits a second market you could be paying a lot more than the actual IPO price but guess what that's the only thing you have to work with the last important point i want you to realize whenever it hits the secondary market you have to have some type of an account with a broker to build up by the stock you can't just walk to the local Walmart say hey I'm here to buy some Twitter stock it could happen that way so you have to set up a brokerage account with either maybe a local broker in your town or going online with say scottrade any of these online brokers or allow you access to buy the twitter stock what's hit the secondary market but you have to have an account established first so make sure that you get the account open get it funded for how much Twitter suck that you want to buy but before you rush out and put all your life savings into Twitter stock please ask yourself what is this not going to do for me how is this going to really change my investment portfolio so be careful don't put all your money into Twitter stock because if you do guess what that could be a bad move and we don't want to do that so if you have more questions regarding Twitter soccer anything finance related this is jeff rose certified flanch a planner until next time take care tweet this twitter IPO hashtag that I don't even know what that means if your twin it twine if you're trying are you trying are you trying why that Twitter twice that Twitter,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

UCmytyE_8CY, what's up everyone all right so in today's episode I'm going to share with you the 25 rule of day trading it's not the 25 rule it's the 20 5 rule of day trading and this is the rule that I discovered that helps dictate When to Walk Away each day because I see it in the comments all the time and I see it from students all the time Ross I don't know when to walk away each day some days I feel like I am massively overstaying my welcome over trading digging myself a hole other days I walk away and then I see a stock makes a huge move right after I leave and I feel like an idiot and listen I am telling you I went through all of this myself and so what I actually did is I poured through my own metrics and that's when I discovered the 25 rule of day trading so if I show you uh this is a you know a typical day for a lot of beginner Traders you start and this is your p l line here,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
UCmytyE_8CY,so you start with you know a couple of green trades you make a little bit of money you're in the black that's good and then you know here we go you take a little bit of a bigger loss than maybe you'd like maybe you bounce back with one more trade and then you take another loss you try again you take another loss and now next thing you know you're going in the red on the day and you might look back and think geez why didn't I stop I don't know right here well why didn't I stop right here why didn't I stop at the least down here before I went right on the day and yet I kept trading this is a day and this is so typical of not just beginner Traders but even intermediate and experienced traders of grasping at straws desperately trying to recoup losses doing anything to avoid closing the day red or just to try to make back the loss of the previous trade and the result is over trading the result is almost always losing money and in hindsight you look back,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
UCmytyE_8CY,and you realize I should have walked away right here the 25 rule is the answer of When to Walk Away each day so I actually just taught this as a class for warrior Pro students so typically you would have to be a full-fledged Warrior Pro member to watch this class but what I want to do is I want to give you the chance to attend it because this is a class that is going to help you better understand that delicate balance of should I throttle up and try to push it harder on a day when the Market's hot or is this a day where I have to ease off the throttle so I'm going to give you some of the very specific uh kind of concrete things that I look at that help me know if I should walk or if I should keep pushing it harder this is a class you don't want to miss so what I'm actually doing is,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

biShqILFMl4, hi folks David Waring here with informed trades calm and today's lesson of the day the second three tenets of Dow Theory and yesterday's lesson we went over the first three tenets of Dow Theory which are the markets have three trends trends have three phases and the markets discount all news in today's lesson we're going to go over the second three which is going to wrap up our discussion on Dow Theory and going to give us a strong basis which we can then move on to some more interesting things look at some charts and move towards places and trades with our newfound knowledge so let's get started okay,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
biShqILFMl4,so tenant four is that the averages must confirm each other if you remember from our introduction to Dow Theory Dow was doing his work on the Dow Jones Industrial Average of the Dow Jones transportation index to understand this one it's important to understand that during dows time around 1900 when he was doing this work the US economy was a manufacturing based economy where today it's a service based economy so tenant 4 is not as relevant today as it was during dowse time but still worth looking at basically what Dow was saying here is that you should not have a rise or fall in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that is not accompanied by a doubt a rise or fall in the Dow Jones transportation average or vice-versa,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
biShqILFMl4,so basically the reason why he's saying this is that the manufacturing companies if they are producing more goods and are more profitable as a result of that then the the companies that make up the Dow Jones transportation average should also be more profitable because they are the ones that are shipping the goods that are made by the manufacturing companies so what he's saying here is if there's a divergence in these two indexes then there's a it's,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
biShqILFMl4,it's a signal of a pending change and if there's not then it's a further confirmation of the trend so you can see here confirmation if you follow the line up they're moving together you can see there if you follow a line across and up that they're diverging there so again not too relevant today tenant 5 is that trends must be confirmed by volume so this one is still very rare even today and something that old technical traders place heavy weight on normally is looking at volume in conjunction with their trend analysis what Dowell is saying here is that there's a lot of reasons why price can move on low volume one trader could come in the market and jerk the price around you know it's impossible to tell really but if the price increase or decrease is accompanied by large volume that means there's lots of participants in the move and therefore that's the further confirmation of the trend that's in place so you can see here chart at Google you can see the uptrend there that's in place initially it's on rising volume and then it continues to rise but on falling volume so without looking at any other information just looking at ten at five we'd have to start to call this trend and to question it actually did sell-off shortly thereafter 10 at 6 is that trends exist until definitive signals prove that they have ended and this is kind of where the debate of technical analysis and the study of technical analysis take us in terms of trying to determine what those signals are that prove the the trends have ended so we're going to look at that in the lessons that come specifically in the next lesson we're going to look at support and resistance and look further into trends and price action around certain levels created by supply and demand imbalances so I hope you'll join us for that one that's it for today's lesson if you have any questions please feel free to visit us at inform trades comm or leave them in the comments section below and have a great day,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Y6QI-K3VZFo, hello barry anderson from trade ideas with today's edition of what makes this trade great now i have to admit uh the market for me anyway has been very very choppy today uh if you just take a look at the spy right there there's the spy right there so i had a nice little pop in the pre-market and the market opens moved down up down up down so there were a lot of choppy things that i saw and redbox is one of them okay rdbx however you know if you're in the room last week i mean redbox has just had a huge huge huge run let's take a look at it on the daily chart okay get the daily chart up and you know look at this run it's ad it's well actually i guess the major run was on was on friday but it actually started right back here you know i mean it's a few days ago maybe a couple of weeks ago this was a two dollar stock and then it chopped around a little bit for a while and then friday it just absolutely exploded and look at this,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Y6QI-K3VZFo,i mean you would have thought maybe that would be the giant green candle but so far this is even bigger and where it goes from here it's hard to know but why what made the trade great of course is that the fact that there is just so much enthusiasm and for i couldn't really find any specific reason i mean this is if you know what redbox is all about all you have to do is look you know i mean i don't know if all they do is still have those little red boxes around where you can rent dvds and blu-rays i'm not sure if that's their only business but nonetheless this has just been uh such a wild mover and the interesting thing is that let me just see one thing here yeah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Y6QI-K3VZFo,so what makes it i mean what makes it well great if you're looking for volatility of course is the fact that it's only has 8.8 million in the float so that's what you're going to see now on friday it traded 100 million shares and today it's already traded 93 meaning today this is noon eastern still four hours left in this market and so it's going to break right through that 100 million chair mark and if you look again if you look left let me see if i can bring it in here look left on this uh say the monthly chart i mean the next high is 11 40. what did it get up to today got up to 10 and then after that i mean we're talking 1920 again i'm not saying it's going to get here,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Y6QI-K3VZFo,but that's all traders are looking at they're just keep looking left to say okay keeps making a new high every single day we're going to keep going to so you know coupled with the low float the fact that for whatever reason traders are super interested in this and they have been for a few days and then we had the pre-market pop the pullback and then the explosion um i have an alert set up here you know over nine dollars about 9.50 i'm waiting to see if this takes this out later on in the day and who knows we may have an explosion through 10. again i'm not this is not financial advice of course but those are the levels i'm looking at to see if they happen later on in the day so i want to get back into the room and let's see the test drive is still you can still sign up for the test drive of course it starts on may the 16th so it's less than two weeks from well actually two weeks two weeks from today is when you start getting live data so it starts on the 16th,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

Wx4ei7YwCaA,see that seven and a half percent very very attractive but a trap a lot of dividend investors fall into is just looking at the dividend yield you need to really look into the company but also keep in mind the payout ratio this company EPS 44 cents I mean you're looking at almost a 200 percent payout ratio that's called meaning essentially this company's paying out about double the amount that it's actually bringing in which means likely this company is going to have to cut dividends we're going to have to increase their profitability in a pretty dramatic way it's also important to look at the past few years in regards to something like this and don't just buy because of the dividend yield just a little FYI subscribe hope you enjoy this thanks for joining me,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

g1rYAqX01zo,you know many many many hours before the market even opens or something like that this is clearly like wall street doing this and a few things that could be at play here one is we have heard of this big influx of money coming in the back half of the month of june essentially you know essentially funds that have to rotate money and we've heard that this big influx of money is coming in the back half of june maybe some wall street money is trying to front run that something like that i don't know uh something else i want to say that's very important is this is a big week of earnings actually surprisingly you might think earnings is like done until bank earnings come out in a few weeks well it's not actually there's three really big earnings reports this week and i think wall street's playing a reverse psychology game here that i want to explain so lenore's reporting before the bell tomorrow okay on tuesday then you have kb home reporting wednesday then,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
g1rYAqX01zo,you have fedex uh reporting basically after the close on thursday those are actually three really important earnings it because two home builders right and one of the biggest global companies that if you want to know how the economy is doing fedex right now wall street could almost be playing a reverse psychology game here and think of it this way right everybody expects at least you know my expectations are for home builders that they're going to say if they get asked anything about how orders are coming in in june how orders came in in may they're likely not going to have good things to say and they're likely going to have bad things to say about demand orders coming through how they're being they're starting to look a little more pessimistic at the market right they're still remaining optimistic,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
g1rYAqX01zo,but you know things are deteriorating they're going to say things like that now usually how this works essentially is if home builders also report bad numbers or not that they're going to report bad numbers in terms of the past quarter but in terms of guidance and like the backlog and orders that are coming through right now that are going to be you know for homes that are going to be built in three months from now six months from now nine months from now right in terms of that usually how it works is if those home builders say something bad so those stocks move down right and it can move the markets down because everybody starts freaking out and like oh boy real estate's starting to weaken which means the economy is weakening but we're in a very different dynamic right now because inflation's been so high what wall street actually wants to see is demand falling wall street wants to hear that people aren't going out there and bidding up those new homes now that's what wall street wants to actually see because the faster we can get this demand down the faster we get inflation down the faster we get inflation down the faster the fed can stop raising interest rates and raising interest rates and the more we can start to normalize the economy or at least get closer to normalization of the economy right which in 2022 we're going to have no normalization the hope is that we can normalize pricing somewhat as we go into 2023 and over this last let's call it six months or so of this year we can start getting inflation down we can start the fed can stop you know start chilling a little bit,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
g1rYAqX01zo,and we can get demand down wall street actually wants to see that so it's very counter-intuitive and it's also a reverse psychology play of what you would usually expect in the market nonetheless and so we'll see how all this transpires i'm just here to keep you guys up to date with everything going on in the market there's a lot of changing uh things all the time check out the video i released earlier today if you didn't get a chance to check out that one that's a really good one um that goes in depth on many different fronts there much love as always guys and have a great day,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
oSVOGd6d2g8," Gaby Lapera: So, point number three, which is kind of related to point number two. This was really common -- ""Keep cash."" Now, I'm not saying this is terrible advice in and of itself. I keep cash, I used to be a bartender and used to keep quite a bit of cash on me at all times. You never know when a business only takes cash. I guess, now you do, because you can check online. But, some people try to do all their purchases with cash, because it acts as a psychological curb that says, ""Okay, I'm physically handing over something for this, and I'm getting something back,"" and it makes it harder for them to impulse buy as opposed to with a credit card, there's not that feeling that you're really spending anything, you know what I mean? John Maxfield: The thing about cash is that, cash has a time and a place. It gives you what our colleague Morgan Housel calls ""optionality."" If you have a ton of cash and the market tanks, you have the dry powder, if you will, to go out and buy cheap stocks. If you don't have cash, you don't have that.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
oSVOGd6d2g8,"But, everything in moderation. As a general rule -- I'm a lawyer, so I think in general rules and exceptions -- you're going to want to keep cash. But if you're keeping more than whatever you perceive to be necessary to give you peace of mind in terms of a safety fund, what does at six months or a year, if you're keeping anything more than that, you're losing value. Even though inflation isn't an issue, it is still increasing at 0.5% or 1% per year, so you're losing value simply by keeping it in cash. Lapera: I just want to interject here, and I think you're correct 100% in what you just said, but I'm talking about physical stock piles of cash that you stash underneath your mattress. Maxfield: Oh. Like Floyd Mayweather. Lapera: Yes. Like, this is very common with, like, grandmas especially, to take your cash and just stash it somewhere in your house. So, instead of having a savings account, you just have all of that in cash somewhere. So, there's a few problems with this. One, if you have a lot of money, where are you going to put it all?",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
oSVOGd6d2g8,"Two, even if it's in a money market account, even though money market accounts aren't making a ton of money, that money could be making some interest in the bank, even if it's not a lot. Three, this is the same issue that you have with gold bullion, which is, what if someone breaks into your house and steals all your cash? What if your house burns down? Your cash is just gone, all your savings. Maxfield: Can you imagine? That would be horrible. Lapera: It's awful. I'm laughing, but it's so bad. Maxfield: Yeah, it would be so horrible. Yeah, I would say there's definitely an added element of actually keeping it in paper. Lapera: This tends to be one you hear from older relatives who maybe lived through the Depression and the bank runs and things like that. But it's not an uncommon sentiment, is what I gathered from asking people in the office.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Ek58NtG_jKE, Motley Fool all about helping the world invest better so what's one area on Wall Street or what's one area in the world of investing that you think we should shine our light on one area rife with dishonesty so there's lots of them but I think the one thing that I would talk to individual investors is to think about the incentive structure of the financial advisor right when you talk to a financial advisor and often time the financial advisors are friends or they know them or they have been the same Club or you know they have kids in the same school and it's really hard to look at somebody and say I know you have conflicts of interest you don't have my best interest in mind but the fact is they probably do and I don't mean that there are bad people you might have a fantastic financial advisor who is a kind wonderful person,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Ek58NtG_jKE,but if they have conflicts of interest that puts them in a really bad situation and it puts them in a situation that might not be able to even see reality in a correct way so I think as individuals we should go to all our service providers and try to figure out exactly what they have in terms of conflicts of interest and when they have conflicts of interest sometimes we can eliminate them sometimes we can't but we should be a aware and be try to reduce them to the extent we can and then of course we should help that the government the regulators the SEC at some point we'll take some stab at reducing conflicts of interest at the level that we don't have a direct contact with but that's a kind of wishful thinking on my part Oh,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

yiRN_e_MjhY,and I'm the social media manager here at the mindful we're here to answer your investing questions and I've got a batch in from facebook and twitter I'm going to send them down to our analysts who answer them with their foolish opinions here's a question from guy on Twitter what investments should 20-somethings be making who don't have student loans so what does a 20 year old with no college debt do with their money you of course want to make sure you're paying off all your high interest debt if you have any credit card debt and you want to establish an emergency fund and then because of your long time horizon you've got 40 years til retirement or there abouts you want to be heavily weighted in the stock market versus say bonds and with that money you want to make sure that you've got at least a five-year time horizon you don't want to be dipping back into the money if you're in the stock market because it is so volatile and you don't know where it's going to be in the next five years but over the long term stock should be going up and so there are two ways to really approach the stock market if that's where you want to be and there's a easy way in the more difficult way the easy way is to purchase index funds and ETFs there's no shame in this you'll track the market and you know the dirty little secret is most investors don't beat the market and I think everyone should be weighted you know at the core of their portfolio even if they pick individual stocks in these index mutual funds and ETFs I think vanguards the best provider of those they're very low cost and very shareholder-friendly now if you want to buy individual stocks in at least part of your portfolio,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

V3M7A9Sd6i4, did you learn anything at the meeting that changed your mind about anything about investing or about any specific stocks about Berkshire well I'd say to two things on that the first is that I think the Berkshire annual meeting isn't a good opportunity to try to say well I'm gonna figure out some secret i'm going to figure out something that's going to just open my eyes and change my whole investing and then i'm going to invest just like buffett if you already know the good solid basics of investing it's a great opportunity to be reminded of them because there's so much noise out there and we hear so many different things that you know your mind can get a little poison from time to time so it's a good opportunity to hear like the very very basics buffett is great at stripping it down to the the ground floor of investing,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
V3M7A9Sd6i4,so that's one thing the other thing I think is being reminded that the key is is finding great businesses and I'm a numbers guy I'm a value guy and a lot of people think of Buffett as a value guy into a large extent he is but whereas he may be started his career very focused on numbers and finding cheap stocks cheap companies over the years he's gotten a lot more focused on finding great businesses that are going to be able to really grow over time and I think that's had a lot to do with the outside success of Berkshire Hathaway right here even some of our most ardent fools here saying things like I really like this company but I you know you should wait for it to pull back a little bit before jumping in,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
V3M7A9Sd6i4,and I always wonder if that's someone who's too close to the numbers it can be and I've definitely I've definitely said that a lot of times in a good recent example is we were looking at mastercard and visa after those two companies reported earnings and you know mastercard is up about a thousand percent since IPO about six years ago or so every step along the way it looked just a little too expensive but you know behind it you have a great company that's growing really well and and still really has a lot of runway today you,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
DDNS1c-qB4c," Nick Sciple: So, you've got an extra hundred dollars laying around. You've built up an emergency fund and can provide for all your basic needs today. So now, it's time to invest for the future. While very few people are going to retire off a $100 investment, investing is a journey. As the ancient Chinese proverb says, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. You've already taken your very first step -- saving $100. Savings are the fuel that feeds your investing engine. Make a savings plan to make sure you'll be able to continuously invest month after month and year after year. You can even set up your bank account to automatically put aside a set amount every week or month to help. Next, you need to sign up for a brokerage account. When choosing a brokerage, be mindful of commissions and fees. While being aware of fees is important for all investors, it's even more important for an investor buying $100 at a time. Many brokers will ask for $7 or $8 per transaction.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
DDNS1c-qB4c,"If you have to pay an $8 commission every time you buy and sell an investment, you'll be 8% in the hole right off the bat, and 16% in the hole if you have to take into account the commissions you'll have to pay when you sell the investment. As a result, you'll probably want to sign up with a discount brokerage, particularly ones that offer free trades. Once you've chosen a brokerage, it's time to make your first investment. Now, with that first $100, you could go out and look for stocks that trade for less than $100 a share; but we wouldn't advise doing that. If you were to do that, the value of your whole portfolio would depend on the results of one company. For just about every investor, an index fund or ETF is the perfect first purchase. These investment vehicles allow instant diversification because they represent an ownership interest in all the stocks in the index that the fund tracks. So, instead of owning just one company, you own a teeny piece of hundreds or thousands of companies.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
DDNS1c-qB4c,"Further, these funds charge very low fees, so you get to keep as much of your returns as possible. Even if you don't get free trades at your brokerage, many brokerages also allow unlimited free trades of select index funds and ETFs. As for which ETFs to buy, if you can think of an investing idea or theme, there's probably an ETF for it. There are tech-centric ones, dividend-focused ones, ones that own small companies and ones that own big companies. For new folks, we recommend starting out with an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500, such as Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF VOO or the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, SPY. These ETFs represent ownership in the S&P 500 index, composed of 500 of the largest U.S. companies. Now, astute investors may have looked at these tickers and realized, ""Wait a minute, shares these ETFs cost more than $100. What am I supposed to do then?"" Circling back to the point from the beginning of the video -- investing is a long-term thing.",overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
DDNS1c-qB4c,"The best thing you can do with $100 now is create a low-fee or commission-free brokerage account, put the money in it, and then put yourself in a position to add more money to that account over time. Once you have enough saved, you can begin buying shares of quality, low-fee ETFs. It may sound unsatisfying, but taking the long view instead of just immediately buying shares of whatever stock happens to cost less than $100 will put you in a far better position 10, 20, and 30 years from now. Even after you've bought that first ETF, remember, this is not the end. This is the beginning -- the beginning of an investing journey that will last a lifetime and hopefully make you smarter, happier, and richer. Thanks for watching!

RAP07LqH6zo, blake boss here folks dan be talking about the best investing lesson i've learned this year you know i've been at the motley fool for a little over a year now it's been a great year and i thought i'd share the best investing lesson i've learned and i learned it from the director of learning development here buck hartsell he's a bit of a legend a great mentor so what is arguably the best investing lesson i've learned so far,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
RAP07LqH6zo,well it's simple it's asking the right questions and why that appears very obvious folks obviously you would want to ask the right questions when you're looking at investments it's in that simplicity that lies lies the greatest of complexity so let me explain here a little bit so when you're doing research on a particular investment formulating the most important questions to be answered for that investment to be successful is a very difficult thing to do and the skill only comes with lots of practice and patience i'm far from being an expert in the area but let me provide an example how this kind of works in practice we're going to be looking at dry bulk shipping,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
RAP07LqH6zo,so i started looking at dry bulk shipping when i was in college and it still remains one of my greatest investing mistakes to date was when i first invested in this industry right in the bubble period if you remember it back when rates were over a hundred thousand dollars a day for some sizes of ships and so it boils down to me not asking the right questions that's what caused me to lose my investment success in this industry so after looking at the sector for a few years now the right question to ask before an investor does any significant research is historically has the industry produced free cash flow for owners in the companies has it made real money that's the first question when i look at dry bulk shipping that i feel like i should ask before i do any more research can do businesses make money in this industry over time so remember to think like a business owner when you're investing looking over the past 10 years in dry bulk shipping,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
RAP07LqH6zo,it's readily apparent that the vast majority of dry bulk shipping companies don't make any real money for the most part there's a few occasions in there that they might have some free cash flow one year but overall collectively they make no real money as a business owner why would i want to own a business that makes no money you would not so i wouldn't want to and that kind of rules out dry bulk shipping for me but that's not where you should end obviously you could be missing out on a lot of opportunities if you just answered that question you also have to ask is there a catalyst to drastically change the economics of the shipping industry where these companies would thereby be profitable i'd argue no from looking at the industry as much as i have so far and therefore dry bulk shipping is an area that isn't somewhere i would want to invest period the economics of the industry aren't something like a business owner such as myself would want to partake in so the takeaway here folks is spend a lot of time coming up with the most important questions that will lead to success in a particular investment and then do your research questions first research second that's focus research then continue to craft what the most important questions are be relentless always try to come up with a better question the most important question that's important to your investing thesis to be successful that's all i have for you today fools be sure to check back thanks for watching and full on [Music],overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

UYL6_94Ok00,the opportunity for risk arbitrage comes after a merger or acquisition is announced now this is generally a fairly advanced strategy since there is a large amount of risk involved so here's the concept ABC is going to be acquired by X Y Z ABC is currently trading at $30 a share XYZ announces that they are going to acquire ABC and let's say $40 a share well almost immediately the stock will jump from $30 a share closer to the $40 acquisition price but it won't jump all the way there it's likely to trade near let's say 37 or 38 or 39 the gap is the risk that the deal doesn't happen that is why they call this risk arbitrage so the concept is that what you would do is you would buy the stock and let's say it's trading at $38 after the deal is announced knowing that it's going to be acquired in some predetermined time let's say the deal is expected to close in six months that means you're going to make the $2 per share the gap from 38 to 40 over the next six months another nuance that people often add is they short the acquiring stock the Furious because they have to lay out a lot of capital to make an acquisition the stock should fall assuming the deal actually happens you get to make money on both ends so the upside is if the deal goes through you know there is a buyer for your stock at $40 there's also a possibility that ABC gets another take out offering from somebody else at some higher price perhaps the next price is offered at $45 and therefore the stock would jump to once again 42 43 44 depending on the risk the bidding war is ideal for the person executing a risk arbitrage well what is the danger the danger is that something stops his deal from happening perhaps the shareholders don't agree to it or the board of directors there's some issue or the government blocks it,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
UYL6_94Ok00,well we know that the stock was trading at $30 if it went to 38 and then you bought the stock expecting it to go to 40 well if the deal is announced that it's going to be cancelled it's likely that stock will fall right back down to $30 a share there are different nuances in this trading strategy based on is it a cash offering or is it a stock offering but this is the basics of how to execute risk arbitrage if you have any questions about the world of investing any suggestions on videos please post in the comments below and please subscribe as we continue to update with new videos every week thank you,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

off9no2zMes, a lot of folks want to know if they should invest in paypal stock and did paypal just kill the buy now pay later platform a firm is it time to buy paypal well let's talk paypal was a 69 stock less than three weeks ago now it's trading for a hundred dollars up 11 in after hours what's going on and is there any kind of risk factor going on here and how does this affect a firm well first some background the company's growing at about nine to ten percent revenue and if you take out ebay it's actually growing at 14 it's core business which is great if you annualize the last few quarters of growth you can actually see they're growing at 16,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
off9no2zMes,so they're doing really really well coming out of 2021 and even through this crazy macro environment in fact they barely even talked about how bad things are in the economy in their earnings call because they're producing cash flow in fact 1.2 billion dollars of free cash flow even though they did take some losses on some investments they made and even though they only added six percent to their user base they ended up with 16 percent more transactions and total payment volume up nine percent that means existing customers are spending more money with paypal and this makes sense because in their earnings call they gave a really neat stat they said the average customer has 800 transactions per year only 25 of those are online and paypal thinks that that 25 will grow and maybe more like half of our transactions will be online in the future now did they kill a firm well hopefully not but one of the big things i hated about paypal's buy now pay later platform in the past was they would just do what was called pay in four which is basically pay every two weeks with your first payment,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
off9no2zMes,and then three times thereafter it's basically pay off whatever you buy within six weeks i thought that was lame and a firm had a really good thing going for it they would let people pay over time that is many months well guess what now paypal is doing that as well oops there goes the potential affirmate especially since paypal already has partnerships with over 200 000 merchants this is a little bit of an issue given that a firm only has partnerships with 6 000 merchants and 90 of the people using buy now pay later on paypal are actually already paypal customers so paypal says we already know their credit histories and their ability to repay which gives us an advantage and lower charge offs now paypal also says they make about 20 extra when people use buy now pay later with them and that's because of what they call the halo impact imagine they make a hundred dollars by because somebody used buy now pay later with them maybe they make 21 now on something else like stocks or savings or whatever they're becoming more efficient trying to trim head count and make sure that they're being a better company so they have less customer service needs and they're moving out of stocks like really focusing employment in the stock sector because that's not too profitable right now for them because remember you could buy stocks with a paypal app but there's a big thing this company has no control over and it's called the transaction expense that's how much other companies are able to charge paypal for letting paypal users use their credit card now that has become 44.7 percent of net revenues versus 40.5 percent and it's growing and the cfo says it's likely to get worse which given that they're in the payment processing business and that one thing keeps getting more and more expensive how much leverage do they really have who knows but at the moment this company is expected to grow their earnings per share in excess of 20 for the next three years earnings per share were 2.79 cents last year now it's expected to be four dollars and that's expected to grow again 20 and 20 that's great for a company that's selling for 25 times earnings you're really only paying a peg ratio of about 1.25 not a bad way to get exposure to buy now pay later which is exploding 22 million customers have used that with paypal and they got cash flow,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

5phhv-coPYE,"but let's answer this question first things first other question is is there any penalties well Michelle or Michelle's husband no there are no penalties since you are 59 and a half so don't you have to worry about paying a 10% early withdrawal penalty but what you do have to worry about is taxes and a lot of taxes are you planning on taking out this full $300,000 in one year if so I mean we're talking to a huge tax bill do you want to give the IRS 60 $80,000 just so you can buy land I don't think you probably want to do that so that's one thing to consider the second thing I have to ask and is just why now why are we doing this now in retirement for most people when they retire they want to retire debt-free so I get I get the fact that you want to pay off the land outright but what's wrong with your current living condition do we have to take out our sizable $300,000 pay a whopping tax bill so we're now all we had the lipof up is our pension",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

7ll9teboqi8," This is Jeff Rose, goodfinancialcents.com. Today I want to talk about something that I absolutely hate, target-date mutual funds. What are they? If you have a 401K then you've probably seen them. These are the mutual fund or investment options that you'll see that have the year after it. For example, you'll see target date 2040, or target date 2025. Essentially what you are doing is choosing an investment strategy that resembles the year that you expect you will retire. Let's say you plan on retiring around the year 2040. You would then chose that target-date fund and you set back and let it do its thing. As you get closer to that year of retirement that target-date fund will generally get more conservative, hoping to protect what you've accumulated to that point in time. So why do I hate them? Why did I use such a strong word? I'm usually not that aggressive as you'll see in a lot of my other videos, but I'm just not a big fan and here's the reason.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
7ll9teboqi8,"When you actually look at these target-date funds, typically these are structured to where you have anywhere from 12-18 different mutual funds in this one target-date fund. So yes, you are diversified. If you actually take those funds on an individual basis and start breaking them down and seeing the fees associated with them, their performance and all the other components that make a good mutual fund, typically in my experience you're going to see maybe seven decent funds in those target-date funds. The rest of them are just crap, pure crap! There is no way on an individual basis that you would ever put any money in those mutual funds, but you don't see it because it is wrapped in this target-date fund. Just here recently I have several clients come to me that had these target-date funds and in their 401K they had other options. They had several options.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
7ll9teboqi8,"Instead of choosing that one default target-date fund, if they would've done some research and done the a la carte method, as I like to say where they individually pick the mutual funds they have in their own 401K, we were able to show them how they could increase their performance sometimes 1-2-3% and in one case 4% more than what they got over the last several years. Even more so they were able to decrease their risk. We use a term called beta to measure. I don't want to get too technical here, but anytime that you can reduce your risk and generate more return, isn't that what we want to do? That is just what the target-date funds don't do. Yes, you have to do your own research. Yes, you have to tweek it as you get closer to that retirement, but if you're getting that much more return why wouldn't you do it? If you aren't comfortable doing it, why not hire a financial planner to do it for you so that way it takes away you having to do the research? You've got a professional to help you out.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

m8hAm2fxbT0,hey it's quite writing this will be a video chart on ticker symbol you are re we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick what do I mean by 30 minute in case of maybe you're new to charts instead of between these candlesticks representing one day's with a price action which is what you would normally see each one represents 30 minutes so while this may look like several days worth of time right here it's actually just today's price action broken down into 30-minute time slices I liked you this time for everything does a good job of telling the quote-unquote story of the price and then makes mapping out where levels of support and resistance a bit easier to see if you say hey clay what does a gap in trap look like I've heard of this term gap in trap what does that look like well here is uh you know exhibit a this is basically exactly what a gap in trap is so the price gapped up here it actually ran ran ran some poor souls bought right there and then from there down it went so believe or not the Bulls do still have some hope but there is a lot of perspective that goes into that what do I mean by perspective well if you are a day trader and you bought right there,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
m8hAm2fxbT0,and you wanted to sell within 10 minutes then of course that doesn't apply to you you could care less about any of that the chart is not looking good for you at all,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
m8hAm2fxbT0,but if you care about the big picture the overall perspective I'm trying to emphasize those words then there is still a chance for the Bulls to build a higher base and therefore build a higher uptrend and that's where this level here comes into play again I want to emphasize because I realize it could be total it sounds totally crazy to say that the Bulls do still have a chance after this big old gap in trap but a dollar 45 is very important because when you stop and think about it well the price would come down here bounce around and then head back up and what would happen from the overall perspective from the big picture well you'd have this set of laws right here you'd have this previous set down there you picture these as stair steps will hey you got stair step two going in the upwards direction and that's named the game from the big picture of things so I don't mean to beat that dead horse,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
m8hAm2fxbT0,but I want to just re-emphasize here that I'm talking about things from the overall analysis now if the price closes blow dollar 46 we're set you know start to separate to the downside at that point in time this is essentially a pump and dump because the price is right back to where it all started and that's what pumping up price actions you right prices make big old moves which check that one's clearly made a big move and then within a short amount of time the price is right back to where it started or sometimes less so but right now I'm not going to call it a pump and dump because definitely speaking like we've gone or the Bulls do still have a chance to build a higher base and then start to build an overall uptrend and I say pumping up I'm not talking about the company itself,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
m8hAm2fxbT0,so i'm not saying like this company's run out of somebody's garage i'm just talking about strictly the price action alone now what about areas of resistance we've established dollar 45 definitely a key level of support but if the price does bounce where some of these hurdles at the first key hurdle on any sort of bounce i'm going to call right there at okay that makes sense right there at a dollar sixty-five that's actually right where the price bounced off of that final 30 minutes and you can see it had some price history over there so dollar sixty-five initial area of resistance and then the next hurdle the Bulls would have to clear up there at that point and that sits at a dollar 73,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
m8hAm2fxbT0,so but really right now breaking levels of resistance is really far down on my priority list top priority right now is just stabilizing so at this point I'm sideways action is just as good as upwards price action so crazy day today we'll have to see what happens with it the next two days one of the most common questions I get is hey clay how do you find the stocks that you trade so what I've done is put together this free resource guide where I talk about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interest in and think may have potential so if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader umbrella means click right here to get access to the guide the guide itself is very short and to the point I'm like I say it is free thanks for watching have a good one,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
GqampRhrAKc, hello there guys I am Jeremy this is a financial education channel and today I just want to spend a few minutes with you guys talking about this new concept for a new channel I have as an idea,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
GqampRhrAKc,and I wanted to run by you guys to see if you have interest in this new idea or not and at the end of the video if you're interested in this idea please give this video a thumbs up or please leave a comment on why you like the idea at the same time if you don't like the idea you have something more you'd like to add to it leave that in the comments section i really want to as much feedback as possible on this video because i don't want to spend a lot of time doing this whole new channel if it's not going to even be something you guys are interested in so basically the financial education channel is going to stay the exact same i'm going to still be talking about stocks i'm still be talking about business and entrepreneurship i'm gonna still be talking about personal finance nothing at all changes with this channel and i pretty much upload almost daily on this channel at least usually 5-6 times a week if not every single day,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
GqampRhrAKc,but this new channel i have an idea for it's basically like a stock market news channel where i talk about the few biggest things that happen in the stock market that day so say you know apple acquired verizon or something crazy you know any type of acquisitions talked about that talked about you know if the stock market went down a ton why did it go down a ton if it went up a ton why did it go up a ton talk about just the few biggest biggest stories or whatnot that happened in the stock market that that day and the channel would be called the stock market news channel and i would just give my take on whatever it is that happened is that a good deal that that company fired at a company you know a jobs report came out is that a good job before or something like that unemployment rate things like that talking about whatever the biggest things are that happened the stock market that day all the Fed raised rates what does that mean for everybody talking about all these various things that sometimes honestly I want to talk about to you guys,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
GqampRhrAKc,but I don't want to do it on the financial education channel if I do it because I feel like the financial education channel is really clean in the videos i do on the financial education channel those can be viewed for months from now if not years from now these videos are viewable for a long time they're relevant forever almost well I'd say most of videos are relevant forever and I'd say the ones that aren't are probably relevant for at least months down the road where's this channel I'm mostly covering news stories so there's only been would be relevant for a couple days if not a week so I want to run this guy the idea by you guys in let me know is this a good idea leave a thumbs up if you're interested in this at all or if you want to get into more in depth leave a comment on why you think this is a good idea if you're interested in it because like I said I'm not gonna do it if no one's interested in this this whole idea of starting another new channel and then spending an hour out of my day to basically do a video and then edit in and upload it that's like an hour or two hour process I'm not really interested in doing that unless it's something you guys really would like and if you if you aren't that interested that's fine leave me a comment while you're not interested or whatever anyways thank you for watching guys and have a great day you you,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
pJbRR2FDa3s, what is the fifth and final way that you recommend i could really wreak my retirement i totally recommend that you trust people with bad information i think that's really the the best one of the best why would i do that i would never like who who would ever trust anyone with that information wow this is a tough one and i'm sure it max and i could just go on with all kinds of anecdotes of situations where either people went to bad financial advisors to bad advice from friends or relatives or got sources of information elsewhere so even if you're doing it on your own you are researching these various financial planning topics somewhere on the internet or books and a lot of that stuff isn't so great either so it's tough I mean Max and I are both certified financial planner practitioners we believe in the financial advice industry but you still have to know enough to know whether you're getting good advice yeah absolutely so you know a lot said about kind of competing financial advisors riding should i go to merrill lynch morgan stanley wherever well you know collectively,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
pJbRR2FDa3s,i think as a visor community we saw our biggest competitor is the loudest person in your family right the most opinionated person your family's ultimately who a lot of people end up taking financial advice from which is sad but also it's sad that maybe not everybody knows the correct resources to find so it's kind of that balance where you're getting financial advice you want to make sure you're getting the education behind that advice rather than just a quick snippets over what you should do and why you should do it so yeah and we've talked we've done episodes in this we won't go at all but we favor fee-only financial planners folks who are fiduciaries Napa has them Garrett Planning network has them and also point out in terms of doing research on your own you have to make sure you get updated research,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
pJbRR2FDa3s,and I thought about this one else listen to a podcast last night about Social Security like I'm sure everybody and talking about the new laws that came out in November that take away two key strategies for married couples if you are reading an article by Social Security that was published in October it's outdated but you might think Oh October 2015 it's perfectly fine information but it's already outdated so reading a good source,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
pJbRR2FDa3s,but if it has not been updated you might be getting bad information no kidding this is also a good time to talk about the power of the media this also gets back to the making short-term decisions but if you're watching a lot of financial financial news networks and you know as a PR person I love and enjoy a lot of producers who work at these shows but at these at these networks but they have to produce you in 12 hours a day of content and if you happen to tune in at a time when they're talking doom and gloom or they're talking you know this is a sure thing or it's not a sure thing man it's don't don't base your don't base your investing and financial advice just on what you hear on TV that's for sure,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
RVmKkcxPr5I, our first question comes to us from mark and he writes what are the rules related to inheriting a non spouse IRA specifically with regard to a Roth IRA my mom's advisor is suggesting that not only would my sister and I not have to pay taxes we wouldn't be subject to any RMDs was army required minimum distributions oh right okay my research seems to suggest that yes we would have to either take all the money out within five years or over our lives / IRS guidelines and that we would have to pay taxes on any subsequent gains to our inheriting the Roth IRA what's the scoop so the scoop is number one they will be subject to required minimum distributions because they are not the spouse what that means is every year you have to look up this IRS table idea the amount of your account by this factor based on your age and that's how much you have to take out ah citing but because it is a Roth it actually is not text correct crestor gates and I fact checker Shawn fact checker Shawn my only job that's,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
RVmKkcxPr5I,but the interesting thing about this is the guy says that his mom's adviser said that they will be subject RMDs am i right about that I know that we wouldn't be so vicious ner md's and he's wrong he is wrong he's wrong so he's wrong on both parts well he's wrong about that and then mark says my research indicates that we will pay taxes well that research research is wrong oh my gosh there's so much wrong all right so and and this just goes to show that first of all there's a lot to know about this stuff so you always have to confirm it so it's a good thing that mark let us know and advisors to can't know everything but the truth is there are a lot of advisors that frankly don't know a lot because you don't you don't have to go through a lot to call yourself a financial advisor so you definitely just because you get that advice from someone you should still double check it not that we're calling his mom's financial advisor bad at their job right,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
RVmKkcxPr5I,and it could be possible to their mother I spies what could be the advisor told mom and mom told the kid and just got it made incorrect in the process but all right so bottom line yes to our MDS are md's yes to required minimum distributions no to paying taxes exactly and yes to the schedule that he said either five years or your life that's an important distinction yes if he does it mean if he doesn't do the RM DS for the first few years then I guess he has to take it out within the five years yep okay another quick tip required minimum distributions also can be sometimes called required mandatory withdraws and I hear that all the time and people get it confused so I just want to let listeners out there no same thing,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

U56aSviifaE,that's the easy part but what's a way you could actually trick the credit card algorithm to give you a little bit of a boost right before you run your credit well about a little over a week before so like eight days before what you want to do is you want to make sure as much as possible all of your credit related accounts have an extra payment made to them I'm not saying you have to pay them off if you can obviously that's great but not everybody can okay make an extra payment you'll send a signal to the credit algorithms the credit Gods who look and go wow this person must all of a sudden have a lot more access to Capital they never make an extra payment now all of a sudden they made two payments in a month instead of one that's a green flag credit score notches up easy fast trick make an extra payment,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
12W75cEMG-Y, the average amazon worker made thirty two thousand eight hundred fifty five dollars last year but the new ceo of amazon made 212.7 million dollars that represents a pay gap of six thousand four hundred seventy four to one so why is this happening right it's happening because corporate profits are now at 70-year record highs but what about the wage growth spiral and the employees causing this inflation well that's not entirely true either because real incomes of ceos not only outpaced inflation but they also outpaced corporate profits while it was found that their employees incomes were negative,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

1zSpz6ZWXz4," - Let's talk mindsets. You can have one of two different mindsets. You can either have a growth mindset or a broke mindset. Let me give you a very specific example of a broke mindset. - I'm broke. - And how not to think. I recently published this short where I shared that I took my family of six, all six of us, to an all-inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic, and I didn't have to pay a dime because I used our credit card reward points. And in the very first comment that I received, this person says annual fee of $50 pays for itself, I guess. What's there to guess? A $50 annual fee is well worth it to get a $15,000 vacation. Do the math 15,000 versus 50. That is a broke mindset. Don't be broke.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
h1RlMtX_1_8," This is Jeff Rose with Good Financial Cents. Today I want to give you the definition of a fee-only financial planner or financial advisor. You've reached that point where you're ready to hire a financial planner to help you reach your goals, but you're not sure what direction is best. You do a little bit of research and you keep seeing this term fee only. What exactly does that mean? Let me see if I can help out. A fee-only financial advisor or financial planner gets paid directly by the client and only by the client. What does that mean? That means they don't get paid a commission for selling you an investment product. That means they don't get paid a referral fee from an attorney or CPA referring clients to you. That means they don't get paid a finder's fee. The only way they get compensated is by the relationship they have with that client, and that is very, very important to understand. How does a fee-only planner or advisor get paid? Most commonly there are four different ways that a financial planner or financial advisor that is fee only gets paid. Number one, they get paid hourly.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
h1RlMtX_1_8,"Just like you were working with an attorney or a CPA, they get paid per hour for the time that they are working with you to achieve your financial goals. When working with an hourly financial planner that is fee only, make sure you understand up front how much they charge per hour and how long it take to work on your case. The second way a fee-only financial planner can get paid is a fee for service. What that means is they charge a set fee for doing a set service; for example, a financial plan. That fee-only financial planner will have a set rate on what they charge for a financial plan. I have see other fee-only planners charge for, let's say a 401K review where they review your 401K options with your employer and help you choose the investments that are best suited for your goals. They would have a set fee for that service. The third way that a fee-only financial planner can get paid is by a retainer fee.",overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
h1RlMtX_1_8,"That is where you would pay an up-front fee for working for that financial planner for an entire year or it could be six months depending on that relationship. Typically in that rule you'll pay an up-front fee for a set period and that fee-only planner will then service you as much or as little as you need. Lastly, a fee-only planner can get paid by a percentage of the assets that they manage. Let me give you an example. Let's say that you have $100,000 that you have invested with that planner and that planner's rate or fee is 1%, so $100,000 times 1% is %1,000. That's how much you would pay that planner or advisor per year for them to manage your investments and also manage your financial planning activities. If you're looking to hire a fee-only planner, one resource that you can check is NAPFA. That is a great source where you can go and literally type in a name, zip code, or a state or city and you'll find a fee-only planner near you.

uqUZYotHRuE, this Candlestick pattern formation will be one of the most simple Candlestick patterns you have ever learned but do not knock it for being simple the reason this Candlestick pattern works so well is one it gives you a consistent set of rules you can follow while trading when it comes to why you actually press that buy or sell button to enter a trade and two it is an extremely logical pattern that shows you buying or selling pressure by looking for what is called close above and below Candlestick patterns the first thing we'll take a look at is a bullish example of this pattern this pattern consists of nothing more than the close above a previous high of a previous candle so if we have something like a downtrend happening and then we get a Candlestick followed by a bullish Candlestick that closes above the eye of that Candlestick this is a clear logical sign that we have buying pressure,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
Tpe2QPEfAvE, and the way I Define double bottoms is very simple I put a box between the bodies and the swing low as in between the bodies and the wick of that swing low and this is the termination point for my double bottom what I mean by that is prices must touch this area I must have at least a wick in this area I can also see a candle close in this area I can also see a wick come past this area but those are the only things I can see what I cannot see is a wick not touch this area something like this would not be a double bottom for me and I also cannot see the body of a candle closed below that previous low because this would say Trend continuation to the downside and if I'm looking to buy I don't want to see train continuation to the downside,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0

rse9xVchfJQ, foreign good morning everyone well it's uh top of the hour 9 A.M so we're gonna start the morning show here on YouTube thank you folks who are tuned in already and who have already hit the thumbs up I really appreciate that so this morning is a particularly slow start and yesterday I wasn't super surprised that it was slow because uh as I indicated yesterday I seem to be in a little bit of a um a habit of having a rather big red day following a long weekend and that's because the day after a long weekend can be slow so that seemed to be the case this morning and um when I sat down uh was the case yesterday and this morning it also seemed slow,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,so it seems to be the case that right now we just don't have a ton of momentum uh we're sort of in between big momentum stocks you know we had uh obviously uh some bigger movers in April and then in early may but the last couple weeks have been really slow which is kind of a bummer I was hoping uh as I brought back the morning show that there would be a little bit more um action a little more excitement but anyway it's just the luck of the draw it's like doing a small account challenge you know you could just have the timing that you start a small account Challenge and it's really slow for those uh that first week and you know trading is hard enough but sometimes luck is not on your side so if that's the case it is what it is can't force it you just have to be patient,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,so right now we're in a little bit of a grind it's slow I'm reminded last year of the fact that my best month of the year was in August a month that typically I expect to be very slow historically August and September are slow months for me but last year August was my best month of the year in September was great too,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,so you know I was pleasantly surprised by that and it gives me hope that you know I should keep showing up every day because you just never know you never know when you might get a stock that makes a big move ends up giving you some great opportunities in the middle of a slow patch you can all of a sudden have a stock that takes off and the fact is it really only takes one trade a day we think you know like very honestly about what our goal is here when I started trading my goal was to sit down and try to make 100 maybe 200 a day I wasn't trying to get rich I was just trying to pay some bills just make enough money to pay a couple of bills and so you know 100 200 dollars that's 10 cents with one thousand to two thousand shares so all we really need to do is find one or two opportunities each day where we have the potential to capture maybe 25 to 40 cents and we'll be grateful to take 15 to 20 off the table,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,thank you so anyways um it's about 905 we've got 25 minutes to the opening bell and um at this point here I'm well why don't we go over the scanner why don't we look at the scanner and I think that'll help us get kind of oriented um you know with uh with what's what's moving this morning so wlgs all right this one's our leading gapper it's at 48 now 48 is not a not a huge gap uh but it's up 48 the high here is 228 it pulled back a little bit down to 202. bounce back up to 222 back down to 207. I guess we could kind of draw a little bit of a uh trend line here right right around there so you're kind of near ascending support um the only thing that I would say is that if we look at the level two on this wlgs you can see it's really stacked up see how stacked up that is stack of sellers this is going to be a very thickly traded stock this isn't going to be a stock that really moves too much I mean I know it's up 49,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
rse9xVchfJQ,but that's probably because it's so cheap uh I don't know I I'm I'm a little bit uh and now you've got a crossed Market you've got a seven seven there I'm a little bit unsure about this one I I just think that you know I I sort of have my minimum price of two dollars this is above that technically but it's awfully cheap I I just don't think this is going to be a big mover so I think the problem with this is you'd have to be willing to buy it and just hold it for a while you know because it's probably going to be a grinding stock so if you have the patience to buy and hold for a while then by all means if you don't this one might not be the best one for you that's my that's my two cents so far on it,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
rse9xVchfJQ,um so I feel like my desk is sort of a skew I don't know I'm gonna have to try to get this reoriented here at some point anyways um so wlgs mrkr is the second leading gapper a float is 6 million shares I didn't mention the float on wlgs it's 15 million it's got five six million shares already so you've got almost one time uh you'll have half float rotation you'll have one time flow rotation for sure today it's gonna have a lot of volume uh but I don't think that's going to be able to overcome the I don't know market makers are on it so mrkr it's below volume weight average price here so again you know it's not positioned well and that's not including the issue about price it's too cheap but um it's also below V web Lumber Liquidators LL you know this is this is not something that I would be interested in trading I usually avoid the stocks with higher levels of institutional ownership uh,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
rse9xVchfJQ,I I tend to find that they grind more and I think that there's more algorithmic trading on these types of stocks which makes it kind of like trying to play chess against the computer so unless you're willing to again just kind of Buy and Hold I think these are going to be difficult for short-term breakout trades of any kind trvn uh Mark just popped up above trvn mark have traded this one in the past as well it's got a 13 million share float it's a lower price stock doesn't really make big moves not interesting trvn lower price stock so the top five gappers are all I mean they're all really at this point I'm like not interesting they're either too cheap or floats too high we don't have the right combination and I know I sound picky here,overall_short_video_data.csv,1.0
rse9xVchfJQ,but uh you know being picky is well I guess it's how I've been able to make over 10 million dollars in net profit you know in a hot Market this is the thing this is something actually kind of interesting here in a hot Market you can definitely reduce your quality standard because you'll notice that just there's just so much positive sentiment that it seems like everything is going up I'll try I've had I had days in the hot Market where I had like 15 stocks I traded I'd be green on 12 out of the 15. you know the accuracy was phenomenal,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,but it's the opposite is true in a colder Market you know you start getting that aggressive in a cold Market you're going to be red on most of these stocks um uh now you you could you could certainly short however we need volatility to be profitable in a serious way and if we don't have enough volatility then whether you're long or short it's going to be hard to be particularly profitable one of the challenges during the cold Market is having the discipline to be patient because when you start feeling desperate you start feeling Restless you start feeling like man I haven't taken enough trades I'm not hitting my daily goal or my weekly goal or my monthly goal you start forcing it you start forcing it you you're going to reduce your quality standard because you're you don't see anything you like so you force a trade on something that's a little lower quality what's going to happen your accuracy is going to decline then you have a couple of big red trades during a cold market now you start to get frustrated you start to push harder and you dig your the hole deeper,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,so you know this is how you can start to go on these downward Spirals and it's an area where emotions can amplify your profit loss swings so emotions during a hot Market confidence excitement you know those can fuel profitability if you get more and more aggressive but while maybe in that instance those emotions can help you maximize opportunity and make more money the same is true during a cold Market the emotions of frustration getting the better of you all of a sudden you start averaging down buying more and more shares you know the next thing you know your drawdowns are getting Amplified because of emotions as well so anyways be aware of that um this morning I'm just a little disappointed that we don't have a better looking Gap scanner you know we have a couple of stocks that are up a good bit you know 46 30,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,but it's not as much as what I would like now I do have my audio alerts turned on um for my scans here so essentially you know I could go walk outside I could go do the dishes I mean I could do anything really as long as I've got the audio alerts on and the volume turned up key then you know I don't need to sit in front of the computer screen now I will of course because you guys are all tuning in and you want me to be here but but for your sake if you want to get up and walk around and stretch your legs I wouldn't blame you because there's nothing really particularly exciting happening right now and you don't want to get that Restless boredom of I'm just sitting in the chair I need to you know I need to press a button and then next thing you know you've taken a sort of silly trade so one of the things that I'll do and I have the benefit of doing this is you know,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,I can go um respond to some comments on YouTube you can go check some emails I can you know take a couple of phenomenal pictures of myself and post them on Instagram you know I've got things that keep me sort of busy so I can stay here in front of the computer um and uh usually prevent myself from making a catastrophic stake Sudoku yes that's a good one although I find that the complex the challenging puzzles um I don't like to have to take a break I'd like to finish it before I you know you get your head you start to get in the zone there it's really keep that focused but anyways um let's see so oh yeah and today is the last day of May so um I would say some would argue Memorial Day marks the beginning of summer so welcome to the beginning of Summer we've got the month of May wrapping up here today and it we had a good start and then it cooled off quickly you know some of the uh some of the drama with the debt ceiling and blah blah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,blah you know it's always something but um that weight on the overall Market a little bit we still have the recessionary fears and this and that the AI stocks that gave us some good opportunities earlier in the month kind of cooled off here towards the end of the month so a year ago today I was in Martha's Vineyard doing a Martha's Vineyard trading challenge which was uh a pretty good success as I recall I was I remember finishing it feeling a little frustrated I had I don't know like I was a 10-day challenge I had like nine pretty solid days I think on the 10th day I gave back almost all the profit I'd made in the first nine and I was pretty disappointed I came out of that feeling like I needed to step off of the emotional roller coaster that can sometimes be trading,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,and I decided uh to go into the summer and this was this is last summer into the month of June or through the rest of June trading very conservatively so I remember setting a Max position size for the month of June and I also um adjusted my Max loss and then what ended up happening was uh let's see going into June I'll grab my calendar here of last year I ended up having um kind of a a slow finish but then I had a really good stretch pretty much from you know this sort of Turning Point around June 20th and these were a couple no trade days I just said you know what I'm not I'm not if I don't see something I like I'm not going to take any trades at all so this marked I think the end those two red days of my Martha's Vineyard challenge I was super annoyed came back the next week had a decent week but felt like I was still trading aggressively had a big red day here,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,and then I was like you got to dial it in dialed it in and then proceeded to finish the month with six green days went into July began a nice green streak had two small red days only three thousand dollars red in those two days and then had a really nice finish to July and then we went into August which was my best month of the year last year and no red August finished with 180 000 in profit in one month so that's how um you know and that's that came out of a um you know came from you know having a sort of real frustration losses and then being like okay I need to turn this around and uh yeah that was a great month and that September was really great too October cooled off a little November was cold had a bunch of no trade days uh but you know it was green December was a little colder as well and then you know that takes us into um into this year so anyways um yeah,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,I just uh it just reminds me here as we're coming up to this similar time of year so sitting at about 12.1 million in Gross really would like to improve my profit loss ratio a little bit but go take time to do that a few um a few uh bigger losses for that ratio for sure okay so it's about 9 18 so we've got a little over 10 minutes to the opening bell the Gap scanner is more or less unchanged we didn't get any um we didn't get any new new headlines here in the last few minutes so we're uh gonna have to be patient whoops about 10 minutes to the opening bell,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,[Music] thank you the those of you who are tuning in on YouTube for the morning show we brought back the morning show to celebrate our anniversary here on YouTube it's the 10-year anniversary and when I started uploading videos to YouTube so I want to do something special for you guys and bring back the morning show here for a little bit so thank you guys for tuning in really do appreciate it thank you for hitting the thumbs up thank you for sharing this with some friends and I hope you find Value in this I wish that there was a little more action uh you know but it is what it is you know you can't you can force it uh you most likely lose money if you force it so it's better not to so Greg is curious about my accuracy percentage on winning days versus losing days sure so let's let's take a look at that while we have a few minutes so um let's see wind days versus losing days um Okay so accuracy on winning days is 72 percent accuracy on losing days is 52 percent,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,and you know it's certainly it's worth asking yourself and this is a very tricky question um you know at what point can you at what point can you realize it's going to be a red day and stop immediately because aren't there of course some days that go red but then finish green so that day ends up moving into the green category here of a winning day because I finished green but for days that go red and then stay red the accuracy is 52 so that is a substantial difference in accuracy now if we look at um average winners average winners are smaller instead of being 1500 they're 1100 and average losers are like almost three times bigger from minus Eleven Hundred to minus three thousand so those average losers start to get a lot bigger on those red days uh but this is all this is you know a huge question of how can you anticipate is it is there something in the data and maybe we need to harness AI for this but is there something in the data that can tell us sooner what's going to happen based on statistics that you know if you have these three things happen you know you go down this much or you have this big of a loss you've got a 90 probability of finishing the day you know twice as red as you are right now,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
rse9xVchfJQ,so this is your friendly reminder to walk away but it would take a significant amount of um of thought and careful look into what some of those recursor [Music] um signals might be of knowing when to walk away but I think it's probably fair to say that um I should learn to walk away a little sooner but at what number exactly I don't know and like I said you know you've got these days where you do go from red back to green so and by the way for those of you guys tuning in on YouTube you're welcome to come uh check out,overall_short_video_data.csv,0.0
