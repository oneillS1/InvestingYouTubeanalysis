Warren Buffett | How To Invest For Beginners: 3 Simple Rules",51246.0,3156690,6365,i had started investing when i was 11. i just dithered away until when i was seven or eight nine but so unfortunately i didn't get started till i was 11. but i bought my first stock when i was 11 and then i experimented with a whole bunch of things like timing of stocks and charting and doing all these crazy things it was a lot of fun profitless but a lot of fun and i did that until i was 19. and i read all the books on investing in the public library and just i ate it up it was fascinating to me but i had no framework i was just searching for something i was hoping that little things on a chart would tell me something about what a stock was going to do it was kind of crazy but everybody else was doing it so i figured i'd do it too sometimes you turn the chart upside down you know it still wouldn't help then in 1949 i read the intelligent investor by ben graham i'd never heard of them up until then and there are really only two chapters in that book that are the key to it but they set my philosophical framework for investing in three ways they're so basic and so simple it's hard to understand how they could be that important but the ten commandments are simple you know the first is that a stock is part of a business i mean you you can't think of a sock as something different it's you value a business and then you divide by the shares outstanding but what you have to think about is what kind of a business are you getting into what are its economic characteristics for its competitors what's its management like all of these things that relate to a business instead of a little ticker symbol i used to know when i was 11 or 12 the ticker symbols of every company virtually on the new york stock exchange i could mark the boards of harris up them you know but i didn't know anything i mean i could you know i knew that x was u.s steel and t was at t and so on but i didn't i didn't know anything i didn't know what was behind them so i had to start looking at at these little symbols or these little names in the paper as businesses and decide how do you value a business what counts the second thing in that in the book is that graham gives you a marvelous set point in terms of how the investor should react to stock market fluctuations he talks about his mythical mr market in chapter eight there's been no better thing written in terms of the investors attitude toward stock prices most people react the wrong way to stock prices i mean they feel good when their stocks go up they feel bad when they go down they think the stock market is there to instruct them and mr market is this partner you have in investing you know he's a remarkably obliging partner this guy comes around every day and he tells you what he'll pay you for your interest in the business or what he'll sell you more at the same price nobody ever does that in in private business if you owned you and i owned a gas station together and i said every day i want you to come in and offer me your half interest in the station and i can either buy your half or sell you my my half at the same price and you have to come in every day and do it you'd be at a terrible disadvantage and you'd be at a particular disadvantage if you're mr market in the market because mr market or a friend of the market who obligingly gives you those figures every day different figures at the end of the day in the start of the day but he's naming a price at which you'll either buy herself the beautiful thing about him is that this guy is an alcoholic manic depressive i mean i mean he is as unsound as they come he wanders around all day you know and looks at the crazy things and he you know he he's going to name all kinds of crazy prices and you don't have to pay any attention to them except when it's to your advantage to do so if that's once a year if it's once every five years it's one stock out of three thousand all you have to do is sit there there you have no moral responsibility to this jerk you know i mean he is naming these numbers you didn't ask him to but he's doing it and all you have to do is pick the one time when he is particularly depressed or particularly manic or particularly drunk or whatever it may be and the market will be all of those things and and you take advantage of it and that's what's remarkable about stocks if you think about it is that if you look at the high and low on all of these american companies for the last year you'll see case after case after case where the high is twice below now that's for sound american businesses running along paying people selling goods and so on if you go out look at farmland 10 miles from here there's no way in the world over here that the farmland is going to range in value from x to 2x it doesn't maybe go from x to 110 of x or vice versa if you look at an apartment house near here and figures on essentially apartment houses like that over a year it won't it won't move 10 in a given year but here are the finest of american businesses and people just name these numbers that go all over the place and you don't have to play except when you want to that's the important thing and that's the that's what graham tells you the market isn't there to instruct you to tell you anything the markets is there just basically to serve you when you want it to serve you you know one of the most important things remember in stocks very hard to do but people have all these feelings about it the stock doesn't know you own it you know you're sitting there with these certificates for berkshire the company doesn't even know you own it you know and the stock doesn't it's trading now and they don't know you own it so it has no feelings about you i mean you've got all these feelings about it but it's just part of a business if berkshire is worth 75 000 times a million and a half shares you know roughly 110 billion or something like that it's a good investment if it isn't it's a lousy investment you know you have to value the business and graham you know it's amazing but people don't do that in wall street you bet you you hear price targets or that kind of thing but you see no one write a paper that says here is the nature of this business over the next 20 years you know what will that what should that business sell for forget about what it's selling for in fact one of the things i always like to do when i'm looking at investments is i like to look at them without knowing the price because if you see the price it automatically has some influence on you if you just sit down with the reports if i get an idea about looking up a company and i get these 10ks and so on i would rather not know the price because i'd rather value it without knowing the price when i used to handicap horses when i was a kid one of the things i would do is i'd get the racing form ahead of time and if there were nine horses in a race will say obviously the probabilities of of each one winning the race had to add up to 100 percent i mean one horse was going to win the race absent a dead heat or all of them dropping dead on the backstretch so if you went through the racing form and i would look at the third race at hialeah i would try to figure out the percentage chance of each horse winning the race and that had to add to 100 then i would compare those percentages to the odds but i first of all i wouldn't look at the odds first i would look at the past performance and all that thing first stock market's the same way third thing in graham's book is the margin of safety if you come up to a bridge and it says capacity ten thousand pounds and you're driving a 9 800 pound truck you drive down further and find another bridge i mean you know they nobody knows exactly what that capacity is and it may have been signed may have been put up three years ago so you always leave a margin of safety you don't try to cut things that close you wait till something kind of shouts at you in the stock market and uh with those three principles you can build all kinds of all kinds of structures on that but that's the foundation and if you've got that in mind and that's in the intelligent investor i've never found anything that remotely compares with all three of the ones i just you can't get rid of one leg of the three-legged stool and still have a good investment philosophy but i would say that the most important thing uh over a long period and working with big money uh is to understand the business let's just say for the moment that you were given a million dollars or whatever some was necessary and you could look around knoxville or look around all of tennessee if you want and buy into any three businesses you know between now and a week from now private businesses not trading or anything of the sort you've got a week to do it or you have to give the money back what will you be doing during the next week i mean you can look at all these companies some of them you're quite familiar with some of them you're less familiar with some you know by reputation some of them you know the management some of them you know you know their competitive situation what will you be thinking about during that seven day period how will you actually be screening these companies out i think you look for three businesses and you can't trade them after you buy them you're just gonna you're gonna own the rest of your life you're gonna be looking for businesses that have enduring competitive advantage you don't want to buy a burger king franchise just because nobody's come within 10 miles of it yet because you know wendy's and donald's and all of those will be there pretty soon it isn't necessarily who's earning the most money now you're going to look for something with enduring competitive advantage now that takes a business with some kind of a moat around it because capitalism by definition is a system where every time somebody has an economic castle somebody else is going to come after it's just the nature if you open a restaurant that's successful here in town you know somebody's going to take your menu and probably take your chef maybe cut your price maybe offer a little more parking maybe be a better better okay whatever i mean capitalism consists of going after the other guy's castle if that's the case you want a castle with a big moat around it there's a lot of ways you can have a motor on something you could have it by patent protection you could have it by location in certain certain areas i mean if you have something in people's mind like coca-cola six billion people in the world practically all of them have something in their mind about coca-cola largely favorable they don't have anything in their mind about rc cola and if rc cola spent a billion dollars advertising they wouldn't have anything in their mind about rc cola but they've got something in their mind about coke and generally it's favorable that's why coke wants to be where people are happy because they want to be at the theater they want to be at disney world they want to be at the world series they want always have you drinking that drink of coca-cola while at the same time experiencing happiness and if they do that they're going to sell a lot of coca-cola and it won't make any difference if somebody is a half a cent less of some serving than coke so that's an enduring competitive advantage and you want it run by honest enabled people don't want to go in with a crook and you don't want to go in with a dope now the best businesses to buy are the ones where you could have a dope in there i mean peter lynch says you know buy a business that's so good that an idiot can run it because sooner or later one will you know and and there's some merit to that uh in fact i got a question the other day from this student group and they said you know what's going to happen to berkshire when you go gaga and i said well berkshire's so good that i can go gaga in fact i may even be you know those are the kind of businesses to own so you want but you want a management that's able and honest and then you want a price that's sensible and that's what you'd look for you go around tennessee got a week to do it and you'd immediately screen out a whole bunch of things you just know that they weren't a fertile area you know that's an important thing to be able to do to know just get rid of all kinds of things there was a great article in the new yorker 30 years ago when bobby fischer was playing spassky in famous chess match which drew attention around the world and they examined how the mind could with billions and billions and billions of possibilities how it could group things so it immediately cast it down to where you had like four options and of course when the humans play something like deep thought you know or whatever the latest version is of the computer on that that computer is making maybe 700 000 or a million calculations a second and the human mind is competing against that but the computer is checking every possibility and the human mind somehow has this ability to cast out 99.999 percent of those things that the computer has to go through in order to focus on the three or four possibilities that really make sense and invest things a lot like that's not that tough because there aren't that many companies but you want to cast out all kinds of things if somebody told me that my life depended on picking among the dow jones stocks a group of 10 that would be the best performers or outperform the index as a whole i would spend my time thinking of the worst up companies in there i would cast out things and then i would figure i left those behind and that's an easier way to approach the problem actually than than trying to pick the 10 best if you were thinking about the state of tennessee you know there's a whole lot of things you wouldn't examine you just figure they're too tough you might decide you know car dealerships were too tough it's always going to be competitive who knows whether ford or general motors are going to be selling more cars five years now or whether there's me terrorists on foreign who knows so you just say i'll give up on car dealers i'll pick your budget i'll think about something else and that approach that you use there is the same approach you really want to bring the stock market you've got 3 000 companies tonight you can look at on the new york stock exchange there's a valuation on every one of them it'll change tomorrow you don't have to play once a year if you have 20 good if you have five good ideas in your lifetime to get very rich you know i i tell students sometimes they'd be better off if they had a punch card when they got out of school with only 20 punches on it because then instead of listening to somebody at a cocktail party and then glass the next morning buying some shirts they'd really think about every punch that's all the punches you get 20 punches is plenty you just have to make sure that you don't do any of them for frivolous reasons we never want to buy anything small at berkshire it just doesn't make any difference you know we want to think about things that can move the needle and that gets tougher as the capital gets greater but that's the way to focus on investments

to predict everything the stock market's going to do in the future look if anyone tells you that never believe them they're probably just trying to sell you one of those courses for 997 dollars so even though there's no magic ball that can tell you when to buy a stock before it rockets in value and makes you a millionaire overnight there is certainly a few things i do to tip the odds in my favor and that's what i'd like to share with you guys today as i've got older and slightly grayer i've found that knowing the reason behind why i stopped my changing prices helped me make and save a lot of money if you're new to the stock market then a stock is a small part of a company and when you buy you actually become a part owner the idea is to buy parts of a company that you believe will go up in value so you're able to multiply your money without doing any extra work but let's face it investing in the stock market can be pretty confusing and most people just pick companies on a whim however that's not how i do it so by the end of this video you'll know my actual strategies for picking great stocks and don't worry i won't be trying to sell you anything so you can just sit back and relax so there are two main ways to attempt to predict the stock market these are called technical and fundamental analysis a good way to think about this is like a scale usually short-term day traders are purely focused on technical aspects these include looking at charts and patterns they believe that they can predict how the stock will change in price by judging the highs and the lows on the graphs they're the geeky ones nah i'm only kidding it's just not how i do it my whole investment strategy is about keeping it simple lots of people talk about using margin and options but that's really not something i worry about i'm a long-term investor so this means i'm a lot more focused on the fundamentals of a company this includes the financials the leadership and the brand recognition as i believe this is where the information lies to indicate the long-term success of a stock however like i mentioned it's a scale so i do cast my eye over the occasional chart in order to find the best time to buy this approach has helped me to find some really good investments over the years rather than just dipping in and out and trying to make a profit on a daily basis the amazing thing is the majority of professional traders are still unable to be a low-cost index fund over the long term this may sound quite complicated but it's actually very simple so this bucket represents an individual stock and the water is me pumping all of my money into that company this represents an index fund each cup being a different company and the water i'm putting in is the money i'm spreading between each of them in one easy investment for whatever reason if this company goes bankrupt then guess what or my money goes down the drain now this is the same company and it still goes bankrupt but the good thing is i may lose my money in that small investment however i've got so many more stocks and i've done really well in some of them which means i've actually made a profit overall my favorite index funds track the s p 500 which are the top 500 public companies in the usa so even though the majority of my money goes into index fund investing i also have a lot of fun picking individual stocks and watching my portfolio grow on this note if you'd like an easy way to get started public are currently giving away a free stock worth all the way up to 50 dollars when you fund your account if you want to pick that up i'll leave a link in the description and if you're in the uk free trade are giving away a free stock that could be worth up to 200 pound when you deposit as little as two pounds i'll leave that link below as well it's a great way to get started with individual stocks and basically it's free money right so now you've got your free stock and you're ready to invest into some more but where should you start well if you're anything like me it makes sense to start with the numbers we call this quantitative analysis whenever i'm thinking about investing in a company i make sure to look at all these figures first if the financials don't look good to me then it's very rare that i do any further research into the company it's kind of like when you go on a first date with someone and they seem really nice however it isn't until you really start getting to know all the details about them that you might start to notice their flaws like eating with their mouth open or picking their nose if only they gave you a non-biased comprehensive list of how they actually are so you can make an educated decision whether you want to date them or not i don't have a solution to this problem but luckily that's exactly what companies do it's brilliant you can find out this information for free on yahoo finance which is the website that i use there are three main aspects that i look at first let's break down the balance sheet i know it doesn't sound too interesting but trust me this is where you find some of the real juicy information the whole purpose of this sheet is in the name to balance assets and liabilities think of it a bit like this you may own a watch or a rental property and these are your assets but let's say you have loads of credit card debt this is one of your liabilities so let's break down some of the gobbledygook terms so you can easily understand this complicated looking sheet and impress your friends assets are broken down into three categories current assets are things that could be turned into cash within 12 months longer term assets are things like their headquarters which they usually don't sell in a hurry companies can also have assets that you can't physically touch known as non-tangible assets such as the brand recognition of an established business that has been trusted for generations i like to think of coca-cola and then we come to the liabilities and what i'm really interested in here are the current liabilities as this is the debt that they'll need to repay within 12 months with this there is a simple calculation you can do to easily know if the company is high risk or not and that is total current assets divided by total current liabilities a good rule of thumb here is the number should be above one but how does this work in practice let's take apple's balance sheet for example apple's total current assets divided by their total current liability comes to 1.4 when rounded up this is great as now we know that apple are able to pay off all their short-term debt nearly one and a half times the second document that's really important to have a look at is the income statement if you've ever heard the saying of the top and bottom line this is where it comes from at the top of the statement this is the total revenue which is the total the business take and at the bottom is the net income which is the money the company makes after all the expenses have been deducted every business has these expenses the cost of operation and the cost of revenue so let's take a simple business like a smoothie company their cost of revenue is fruit they can't make the smoothies without buying that therefore that is a cost they have no choice about it's a simple fact of running their business but the next thing they do have a choice about which is their operating expenses who they're hiring and what kind of wages that they're paying them after these expenses are deducted from the total amount of money they take from their customers you get the operating income so here's my simple calculation that lets me know if the business is healthy operating income divided by total revenue times 100 ideally i look for above 15 using apple again let's take this number divided by this number and we get 27 which is great the last one of the big three is the statement of cash flow i'm not going to spend too much time on this one as when you boil it down it's pretty simple the main thing i look out for is if the company i'm investing in has increase in free cash flow year on year which is money they can use to reinvest or pay back to investors a big red flag here is sometimes i see the cash flow is negative but the company is still paying dividends back to its investors it's just unsustainable and eventually the business is just going to run out of cash now once i've had a good look at all these numbers it's time to get into the juicy stuff and that's all about analyzing the qualities of a company this is known as qualitative analysis one of the qualities i look for is brand recognition when i say the word apple most people think about the company rather than the fruit i know i keep referring to it but it's a great example of amazing brand recognition that won't be going away anytime soon being a household brand name comes with a lot of consumer trust so when they launch a new product people are much more likely to try it out especially if it's something unique or groundbreaking such as the ipad and we like to show it to you today for the first time and we call it the ipad this helps companies like apple shape our future and create entire new markets and revenue streams another great example of brand awareness is coca-cola it's the second most recognized word in the world after okay something that really affects price movements is the news i always keep an eye on it and in particular rumors on social media you may have heard about the whole gamestop situation where a small bunch of retail investors managed to outsmart the top hedge funds by finding a flaw in their strategy they were able to use this to their advantage and earn a lot of money tonight it's wall street's david versus goliath the struggling video game retailer gamestop skyrocketing about 8 000 percent over six months but once the news broke and more people started to jump onto the bandwagon the big profits had already been made this is a great example of the age old saying buy the rumor sell the news i learned this valuable lesson during the dot-com boom in the 90s when i started investing people were amazed that i was pouring money into companies whose main asset was a dot-com domain name however within six months it seemed that everyone's telling me that they were buying shares in dot-com companies even my hairdresser i decided to start selling to buy more real estate just weeks before the bubble burst and i managed to save the majority of my profits others weren't so lucky everyone thought that internet businesses were the future and they were eventually right however most of the original companies never recovered and i saw some of my friends make millions just to lose 90 percent of their investment when everything crashed only a handful of companies managed to weather the storm such as amazon this showed me that the hype generated by the news and other people talking about it really just caused the prices to get out of control and become unsustainable so whenever i feel like hype is driving the price of a particular stock i know that it probably isn't a great long-term investment although with the dot-com bubble it is true that a lot of companies did rebound eventually the next important factor is the leadership of the company even more so nowadays with social media and what the leaders say is having a huge effect on the price of the stock a prime example of this is elon musk who is very clearly the visionary behind all of his companies one of them of course being tesla just imagine if elon musk decided he was bored of making electric cars and tweeted that he was standing down from tesla to focus on spacex and his mission to colonize mars i think this reliance on elon musk is one of tesla's greatest strengths but also one of its greatest weaknesses as the company is highly affected by his actions this brings me to my next point which is to look out for emerging future industries like electric vehicle technology which tesla is leading the way in these types of investments are really your growth stocks my friend simon squibb often tells me he believes that in the future doctors will be replaced by artificial intelligence this sounds like the stuff of science fiction however when i was younger this was what i used to see on star trek spark spark here in fact this is even better i actually first heard of tesla when it was featured on top gear in 2008 it wasn't a very flattering review as they showed the car running out of batteries in 50 miles which was only a quarter of the advertised range elon wasn't very happy about this and he actually later filed a lawsuit against the show however the segment certainly piqued my interest and i could see they were onto something during my time investing i've seen a huge shift in each sector or if you're american at home sectors let me take you back to when i was younger if you can imagine that far back i remember sitting at my grandma's house and watching this guy come along with a sack of coal on his back which he would deliver to my grandma so she could heat her house nowadays most people use gas so no more mr coleman and this sector is all set to change again with the introduction of renewable electricity but that's three major shifts that i'll experience in my lifetime if i'd been stuck in my ways and not taking notice of these changes then my investments would have been left in the past just like the coal industry so before investing in a stock i always think about whether a future shift in sector will have a positive or negative impact on that company but how do i predict when the best time to buy is you don't but there's a strategy i use to get around this and it's called dollar cost averaging let's imagine you were to invest once a month for three months month one the stock might cost you two hundred dollars month two hundred and fifty dollars a month three hundred and thirty dollars of course if you knew it was going to dip to 130 you'd have bought then however no one knows how low the price will go but by doing this instead of investing all your money in month one when your stock was at 200 you actually lower your average buying price to 160 dollars this is also known as buying the dip instead of getting scared and selling like the majority of people would the idea is to buy more because it's like having a garage sale and if you've done all your research and you like the company then the stock is at a bargain price so i'm going to leave the next video right up there but don't click on it just yet make sure to subscribe for more videos and pick up your free stocks with the links below okay i'll see

it is we we started building this little snowball on top of a very long hill so we started a very early age and rolling the snowball down and of course the snowball the nature of compound interest is it behaves like a snowball of sticky snow and and the trick is to have a very long hill which means either starting very young or living very to be very old the i you know i would do it exactly the same way if i were doing it in the investment world i mean if i were getting out of school today and i had ten thousand dollars to invest i'd i'd start with eas i would start i would start going right through companies and i probably would focus on smaller companies because i would be working with smaller sums and there's more chance that something is overlooked in that arena uh and as charlie has said earlier it won't be like doing that in 1951 when you could leap through and find all kinds of things that that just left off the page at you but that's the only way to do it i mean you have to buy businesses and you or little pieces of business is called stocks and you have to buy them at attractive prices and and you have to buy them and you have to buy into good businesses and that advice will be the same 100 years from now in terms of investing that's that's what it's all about well if you're interested in business uh i definitely think you ought to learn all the accounting you can't all by the time you're in your early 20s uh accounting is the language of business now that doesn't mean it's a perfect language so you have to know the limitations of that language uh as well as all aspects of it so i would advise you to learn accounting and i would advise you to be in terms of part-time employment or anything else work at a number of businesses there's nothing like seeing how business operates to to build your judgment in the future about about businesses uh the you know when you understand what kind of things are very competitive and what kind of things are less competitive and why that works that way all of that adds to your knowledge so i would do a lot of reading if you're interested in investments i would hey i would take the accounting courses i do a lot of reading about investments and i would get as much business experience i would talk business with people that are in business to find out what they think makes their operation tick or where they have problems and why i just think you just kind of sop it up every place that you can if i were working with a small amount of money the universe would be huge compared to the universe of possible ideas i work with now you mentioned that 56 to 69 was the best period actually my best period was before that was from right after i met ben graham in 19 early 1951 but from the end of 1950 through the next 10 years actually returns averaged about 50 percent a year and i think they were 37 points better than the dow per year something like that but that i was working with a tiny tiny tiny amount of money and so i would pour through volumes of businesses and i would find one or two that i could put ten thousand dollars into or fifteen thousand dollars into that would just ridicul they were ridiculously cheap and obviously as the money increased the universe of possible ideas started shrinking dramatically the times were also better for doing it in that time but i i think that i think if you're working with a small amount of money with exactly the same background that charlie and i have and same ideas same same whatever ability we have you know i think you can make very significant sums but you but as soon as you start getting the money up into the millions many millions the the the curve on expectable results falls off just dramatically but that's that's the nature of it when you get up to things you can put millions of dollars into you've got a lot of competition looking at that and they're not looking as i did when i started when i started i went through the pages of the manuals page by page i mean i probably went through 20 000 pages uh in the moody's industrial transportation banks and finance manuals and i did it twice and i actually you know looked at every business i didn't look very hard at some well that's not a practical way to invest tens or hundreds of millions of dollars so i would say if you're working with a small sum of money that and you're really interested in in the business and willing to do the work you can you will find something if you were you there's no question about in my mind you will find some things that promise very large returns compared to what we will be able to uh deliver with large sums of money is business school worth it depends on the person much more than it depends on the school some people are going to get a lot out of advanced education and some people are going to get very little and i don't even think it's important that every person go to college at all we have all kinds of jobs at 70 or so thousand a year 80 000 a year that college training is not abuse and i actually was not keen on going to college myself yeah my dad kind of jollied me into it he could get me to do anything but i knew i could have a good time i liked investing and i could read the books you know it's a big commitment to take four years and the cost involved and maybe the loans involved and everything i think depending on what your interests are in life i don't think it's for everybody i think it's for a lot of people but there ought to be a reason you're going and i didn't really see much reason there's nothing like following your passion i mean i love what i do obviously and i've loved it the whole time i've done it charlie it's the same way we have managers you know they come some of them went to business school some of them didn't you know they they they're all types but the the common factor in the in in them is they love what they do you know and and you've got to find that in life and some people are very lucky in finding it very early i was you know i was dumb luck that my father happened to be in the securities business so when i would go to his office there were a lot of books to read and i got entranced with that but you know if he'd been in some other occupation i would i think i would have read those books eventually but it would have been a lot later so if you find something that turns you on my guess is you're going to do very well and the beauty of it is in a sense there's not that much competition i mean there are not a lot of people out there that are going to be running faster than you in the race that you elect to get into and if you haven't found it yet you may well have found it but if you haven't found it yet you've got to keep looking and we've got 70 plus managers you know some of them some of them didn't we had one guy that didn't go to high school charlie oh yeah he quit in fourth grade i think yeah well mrs b never went to school a day in her life you know and when you go out the furniture mark i hope you go out this evening we expect to set a record today in sales the uh what you are looking at on those 78 acres you know is the largest home furnishing store about 400 million of sales largest store in the united states and it comes from 500 dollars of capital paid in by a woman that never went to the school a day in her life and couldn't read or write you know i mean she loved what she was doing and you know i tell the story this is a true story when she was in well into her 90s she invited me over to her house for dinner that was very unusual and a very nice house six or seven blocks away from the store and i went into the house and the sofa the chairs the lamp the dining room table they all had little green price tags hanging down it made her feel at home and and i said to her mrs b you are my kind of woman yeah forget sophia iran i mean this is my kind of woman she loved us you know and she loved it all her life and just think of what that produced i mean it just it's incredible i mean you know one time my dad used to quote emerson that the power that lies within you is new in nature you know and basically the power that was within mrs b was new in nature and and over a lifetime it produced amazing things so find find your passion and then don't let anything stop you the biggest mistakes are the ones that actually don't show up they're the mistakes of omission rather than commission we've never lost that much money on any one investment uh but it's the things that i knew enough to do that i didn't do we have we have missed profits of as much as you know maybe 10 billion dollars in things that i knew enough to do and i didn't do now the fact i didn't buy microsoft way back uh is not a foregone opportunity because i didn't know enough to make that decision but there have been other investments where i didn't know enough to make the decision and for one reason or another i either didn't do it at all or i did it on a small scale i was sucking my thumb when i should have been writing checks you know basically and and you know those don't show up you know there's no place where it shows missed opportunities but i've i've missed some big ones you know i will take a person graduating from college and assuming their normal shape and everything i will be glad to pay them you know probably fifty thousand dollars for ten percent of all their earnings for the rest of their lives well if i'm willing to pay him ten percent for fifty thousand for ten percent that means they're worth five hundred thousand if they haven't got a dime in their pocket as long as they've got a good mind and a good body seventy years ago i was in high school almost a third as long as the country has been around and when i was in high school i really only had two things on my mind girls and cars and i wasn't doing very well with girls so we'll talk about cars but let's just imagine that when we finish i'm going to let each one of you pick out the car of your choice sounds good doesn't it uh pick it out any color you name it it'll be tied up with a bow and it'll be at your house tomorrow and you say well what's the catch and the catch is that it's the only car you're going to get in your lifetime now what are you going to do knowing that that's the only car you're ever going to have and you love that car you're going to take care of it like you cannot believe now what i'd like to suggest you're not going to get only one car in your lifetime but you're going to get one body and one mind and that's all you're going to get and that body and mind feels terrific now but it has to last you a lifetime the key is to is to certainly in terms of your personal life the most important decision you may make you'll make is is the spouse that most of you will likely have and it's very important to surround your people yourself with people or the better than you are you are going to move in the direction of the people you associate with so i i've been enormously lucky in that respect i mean i've i've just had teachers and and friends and a spouse that really was a better person i was and i had enough sense to learn from these people that that life went better if you behave better yourself and uh it took a while the uh so i i advise you to seek out as your partner in business your partner in life whatever it may be look for the people that actually are examples to you rather than somebody that you need you think you need to straighten out yourself and simple rules like that delighting customers working through other people associating with people that will will cause you to move in a better path than you might otherwise have they will take you so far in life that uh it it's hard to believe

number two if you don't think you're a good ice skater or if you're convinced you're not a good cellist you're not going to try it but people are buying stocks anyway they're not discouraged they just think it's a gamble yeah we begin with peter lynch time magazine has called him america's number one money manager during the 13 years he headed the fidelity magellan fund it was a top-ranked general equity mutual fund his new book beating the street offers advice on picking stocks and maximizing profits and he's here to talk to us about a lot of things welcome to the broadcast you wrote a book called one up on wall street and i think that's one of the best-selling books ever about wall street if i'm not correct you can correct me so why then did you write another okay okay i think the reason i wrote it is the first i try to explain to people their great advantages their edges they have and that they should get involved in stocks right and they should do it on the right basis on the first book right yeah and obviously i didn't make a great impression because the percent of people's assets involved in stocks has gone down in 1960 people had 40 of their financial assets including their house in stocks and mutual funds in 80 that was down to 25 it's now down to 17 and why do you think that is well i think people in the decade of the 80s was the best decade this century for stocks i think people managed to lose money in the 80s doing it themselves because their methods were so flawed so i i really feel as though i wanted people to understand i don't want anybody to buy a stock i'm saying if you're going to buy a stock you should do certain things right if you're not willing to do these things you should leave your money in the bank your philosophy is simple and i'm remembering this from the previous book i think we're now talking about the previous book correct your philosophy was if you find something that you identify with i remember that was the story of your wife and her hose yeah your wife kept all the legs oh you got it legs and panties your wife said these are the greatest things i've ever seen right and when your wife said that you knew that this was a product that was better right you used to stay at la quinta motel right the service was better whatever was better the price is good and the price was good too and you said this is a place that i can determine i peter lynch can tell that this is a good product right if these people are making a good product then their earnings are going to go up therefore the stock's going to go up right and that's the kind of decision-making process you ought to go through right do i have it you've got it exactly right well i do i don't think people understand there's a 100 correlation with what happens to a company's earnings over several years and what happens to the stock if the company mcdonald's has done very well as a company right the stock has done very well people worry about too much money supply what's happened the price of oil who's the president who's being nominated for the supreme court it's the ozone layer there's nothing to do mcdonald's earnings go up the next 10 years the stock will go but what they will say to you peter is that as you know and why am i telling you this but it's fun to tell you this they're telling you that these other things influence the amount of earnings of a particular company if we're in a recession people are not going to spend as much money on going to the movies or whatever they do right and and therefore you got to pay attention to these other things because they impact on earth they are very important but you have no idea of knowing what they're going to do alan greenspan is the head of the federal reserve right he cannot predict interest rates yes he'd be the first to influence but he can't predict them he cannot predict what long-term interest rates are going to be one year from now two years from now three years he's even surprised how low they are now right so how am i supposed to pick interest rates how am i supposed to predict the economy you certainly remember the recession of 82 yes 1982 with a 20 prime rate 14 unemployment 12 percent inflation i don't remember anybody telling me in 1980 or 81 that was going to happen all of a sudden we had the worst recession since the depression i didn't read about in the paper so it's crazy to think about these things here's a quote from you i own dunkin donuts when you own dunkin donuts you don't have to worry about korean imports you don't have to worry about m2 or m3 these are money supply figures and what's happening to the money supply this is the way you make money if you don't understand what the company does you should not be in it if you could predict the stock market you could predict the economy you could predict interest rates if you go buy the wrong stocks you're going to lose have your money anyway right i'm saying people have natural advantages yeah let's say what you do for a living is you're involved in the restaurant industry right you supply paper products you supply kitchen equipment you help build restaurants you saw mcdonald's you saw chichi you saw chili's you saw cracker barrel you saw dunkin donuts kentucky fried chicken taco bell these are all these stories these were 40 40 fold you made 40 or 50 times your money you don't need to make that kind of money many times your life right that's all you had to do was follow the restaurant industry people are in industries they're in the publishing industry they're in the chemical industry the paper why don't they just stay within industry you only need a few stocks a decade how many good stocks you need a lifetime instead of people they're in the restaurant industry they're buying biotechnology stocks the people in the camp the people in the chemical industry are buying oil stocks it's absolutely absurd people don't understand their natural advantages and they don't use them so that's that's bad number one but worse number two if you don't think you're a good ice skater or if you're convinced you're not a good cellist you're not going to try it but people are buying stocks anyway they're not discouraged they just think it's a gamble yeah so therefore they go forward and they they bet on one stock for a week and a half and it goes up and they make two dolls on it then they sell it they buy something else when three years is over all they've done is generate a lot of commissions they've probably lost money that's a mistake so your advice is what if you don't understand a company if you can't explain it to a 10 year old in two minutes or less yes don't own it because when it goes down let's say the stock goes down too you don't understand what's going on what do you do do you buy more do you do you do you flip a chances are your broker doesn't either you they he or she certainly doesn't know about it i mean who knows what advance what all these things are at auto back planes and megaflops who knows what all this is so buy what you know buy in your industry buy what you know buy local people so so suppose you you don't have an industry i mean you know you don't really you what you buy company local companies right companies your own industry ten years after walmart went public ten years after walmart ten years after it went public it's a 25 year old company now right you could have bought the stock and made 50 times your money on it 50 times this is if you bought it 10 years after it was public already it already gone up five-fold so you could have made 250-fold but i'm saying let's say you were in a town they came into it they said boy these prices are great they're doing terrific i like the bargains you checked it out you spent a little bit of work on it yeah i mean people are very careful when they buy a dishwasher they do some research they'll put ten thousand dollars in some stock they're here on a bus so if you did a little bit of research you say walmart's only only ten percent in the country they're not even saturated there why can't they go to the rest of the country so is this this is more of the same is this it's more of the same plus i show examples it's it's a touch more detailed it actually shows me in an action right i picked 21 stocks early in 1992. some work some don't i follow those companies some of the companies the fundamentals deteriorate some they improve i watch those companies go through the year i also explain the retail industry i try and make it very simple i talk about a wonderful example is a seventh grade class yeah the teacher of that read my book and my first book that you were talking about you you and i did a show on that in washington you remember that show this is a long time ago she read the book and i said if you made it through fifth grade math you can do it in the stock market she says okay she started teaching it in seventh grade seventh grade class these kids had to study companies they had to look at their balance sheets to see if they're solving and they pick stocks these stocks were up 69 percent over two years when the market was up only 20. they picked stocks like limited they picked the gap they picked walt they understood these companies they also picked ibm i lost money on that too yeah i mean everybody makes mistakes but it did yeah but i'm saying this is this was this was the school saint agnes school in arlington mass but in addition in the decade of the 80s there's 8 000 investment clubs these are amateurs sort of right average people just investing these investment clubs 62 of them these clubs beat the market in the decade of the 80s only 25 percent of professionals beat the market let me go back to one other subject you after you're coming back to fidelity aren't you just i'm not gonna do something when i when i finish this book i've been working about one or two days a week the last year and a half on this book right now i'm done with the book i'm going to go back to maybe one day a week working with the younger analysts just listening to them talking to them i'm not telling them to buy zero zero lifestyle not totally i'm not gonna run another fund 13 years is plenty of running a fund i'm just going to work with younger analysts let them ask questions i'll ask them questions it's going to be a lot of fun now do you still follow do you manage any money for anybody other than yourself no no i manage money with other people for some charities right but no i don't manage anybody's accounts you're not doing some mutual funds no it's nothing i'm out of it cold turkey all right you called turkey cold turkey are you happy you did this i'm obviously delighted it's been and you like your new life oh it's fabulous four or five years ago you just said and i'm managing all this money i'm gonna do i'm gonna quit yep that's right and what and you went to do what well actually i want to spend more time my wife and my children right and it was an interesting situation because i loved my job i adored my job and i and i liked outside activities and when i was young you know i didn't wasn't involved in charity work until i was 30. no activities younger children you just read them a book and a good night moon and they fall asleep but it's all over when they get older there's more time involved so i enjoyed the family i was leaving for work at six in the morning i was getting home at seven o'clock at night six days a week i was in boston yeah traveling 14 days a month it was just too much so i said you know i i said that's it i can't take it and fortunately i'd made enough money to say i could give up the jobs i didn't have to give up the family or the outside activities and so what happened then so you did what with your well i cut back from about a 80 a 90 hour a week to a 40 or 50 hour week and i in the morning i make breakfasts and lunches for the kids and i do the spelling words and the spanish words carolyn does the math and the science and i uh see carol in the morning and off i go to a place you have to go to my opinion you have to go somewhere to do something if you stay at home you want to be answering the telephone or watching cartoons so yeah it's like falling asleep taking a nap so she does the hard work and i go i go finally gave me an office i have a secretary and i spend majority of the time working on charity things like inner city schools inner city libraries inner city housing you know helping people manage their money or no not at all just i'm some of the charities i'm on the investment committee of some of the museum of fine arts the you know i'm involved in national hospital boston college but united way but all the extra things i added to were real hands-on actually being involved in charitable activities

too¬† oh thank you see you later how does this crash¬†¬† like look compared to what you've seen in the¬† past the way the people acting everything how¬†¬† different does it seem that's a good question i¬† think in the past two crises covet and financial¬†¬† uh crisis uh there was a lot the government¬† could do to really help with a rapid recovery¬†¬† it's a different circumstance this time¬† over time the markets have always gone up¬†¬† and just have confidence that things will recover¬† as the afternoon was approaching people were¬†¬† getting less interested in talking to me and after¬† being rejected over a hundred times i had truly¬†¬† reached my breaking point that might have been the¬† coldest rejection i got so far and even though it¬†¬† was painful it was actually great talking to¬† all these people but i was looking for a real¬†¬† wall street legend and for that there was only¬† one place i could go you know well you know we¬†¬† got all dressed up and everything to try to come¬† into the stock exchange is it possible to go in¬†¬† there for a video real quick um unfortunately¬† this hasn't been open to the floor since¬†¬† 9 11 no worries thank you man i really wanted to¬† go inside so i decided to make a few phone calls¬†¬† to see what i could do unfortunately i wasn't¬† having any luck and then i called my boy sam yo what up bro we here in the city¬† right now we're on

some cool news for you what's up¬† so a few months ago i met with this guy¬†¬† and i want to make sure you guys get hooked¬† up inside the stock market machine where you¬†¬† saved the day man thank you hey let's go¬† over there maybe should i take you there¬†¬† yeah all right cool i have a meeting in like¬† 20 minutes so i'll take you there real quick¬†¬† and then you guys do whatever you want¬† but i gotta run after that okay let's go¬†¬† how are you investing during these times¬† what do you think about the crash overall¬†¬† so obviously the market's not where it was before¬† so we shouldn't be looking at the prices i think¬†¬† we will be falling for the next few months but i¬† will be looking at the great companies like tesla¬†¬† amazon nvidia all the companies that in five years¬† from now will still be rocketing to all-time highs¬†¬† and slowly averaging down however not overdoing¬† myself averaging slowly to extent where i don't¬†¬† feel overextended inside the market this is it¬† man this is where it all happened so he's gonna¬†¬† be in about five minutes he just confirmed it with¬† me um he's gonna take you to that entrance right¬†¬† over there they're gonna clear through security¬† once you're in you can go straight inside take¬†¬† all the content you need thanks again bro got¬† it brother all right peace out gotta run see ya i'm not gonna lie at this point i thought we¬† were good i mean we had secured an interview¬†¬† with a big dog on wall street but unfortunately¬† i legally can't say if we went in there or not¬†¬† even if we literally did get invited to¬† go inside which i'm not saying we did¬†¬† a week after i got home i was told i am not¬† allowed to use any of the footage at first¬†¬† i was gonna scrap this whole video i'm¬† just like sad i'm like super bummed like¬†¬† yeah we'll figure something out but we came such¬† a long way i couldn't go out like that so instead¬†¬† of throwing this whole interview away i had an¬† idea so first off how long have you been coming¬†¬† to the stock machine i came here in 1985. got you¬† and you've seen a lot since then a lot of crashes¬†¬† a lot of recessions how does this current dip in¬† the market relate to those do you see a similarity¬†¬† or it's way different i've seen the crash of 87¬† the bubble of 2000 the financial crisis of 07.¬†¬† you know the crazy years under professor orange¬† over there and then i've seen uh kobe crack¬†¬† i think this has components to it that i can¬† describe that i've never seen before no one's¬†¬† ever really had a health crisis this way before¬† the economies of the world were shut down to zero¬†¬† the airline restaurant hospitality travel this¬† that and the other thing were basically done¬†¬† the federal reserve bailed us out¬† but i think if we had not done that¬†¬† we would be in much bigger trouble than we are now¬† what's the best way to invest during these times¬†¬† i'm not a financial advisor disclaimer all day¬† long that's not what i do i understand there's¬†¬† no better time to learn about the market and¬† invest and trade the market then during a crisis¬†¬† because the volatility makes for great learning¬† experience if you're an investor looking to get¬†¬† into the market for the first time you've got to¬† learn how to do this you can make money on an up¬†¬† market and a down market markets do go up and¬† down we really appreciate it my pleasure first¬†¬† day on wall street was a huge success but honestly¬† all this suit is like uncomfortable and i don't¬†¬† know if this lifestyle is for me so i think it's¬† time to go home see you guys in the next video some tips for him it's his first day on¬† walking down wall street just work hard¬†¬† work hard yeah play hard i like¬† this guy uh guys still in here

Dave Ramsey: How To Invest For Beginners",31412.0,1177789,2244,you guys know by now that i'm a firm believer that the borrower is slave to the lender because your most powerful wealth building tool is your income and when you haven't committed your income in the form of payments to everybody else you can invest it and become wealthy really the average car payment in america today is 503 dollars that's just cray-cray that's nutty if you invest 500 in a decent growth stock mutual fund from age 30 to age 70 you'll have over 5 million dollars that one thing will make you worth 5 million isn't that amazing and so i've become known for getting people out of debt and it changes your life it changes your family tree it changes your retirement you retire with dignity you don't have to buy that cookbook 72 ways to prepare alpo and love it but you have to do it on purpose and getting out of debt in order to invest is the shortest way and what is amazing to me is that almost the entire financial industry focuses on one part of the equation and that's the investing part of the equation and they all have a bunch of theories now i've had all the letters and licenses after my name i have a degree in finance i've had all the licenses in the business it is amazing the number of people in the financial world whether they're financial advisors writers bloggers whatever they do that have opinions about money that don't have any money and whose track record on teaching people to invest in getting them to invest sucks three percent of the public is where all of those people make their money off wealthy people they make all their money off wealthy people and most of the advisors out there won't fool with you if you don't have some money they don't want to sit down and talk to you and so we start teaching people of course all these years ago how we invest and then as we've met with many many many thousands of millionaires over the years how did they invest what are they doing well we suggest and i personally invest in good growth stock mutual funds i spread it across four types growth and income growth aggressive growth and international and i buy mutual funds that have at least a 10-year track record well dave shouldn't you just buy index funds well you can if you want index funds basically an s p 500 fund mirrors the market that basically is the stock market and so you're going to do exactly what the stock market does good or bad the mutual funds that i buy outperform the s p 500 and they're really not that hard to find a lot of mutual funds don't outperform the s p 500 so if you're going to buy that well that'd be dumb just buy an s p 500 but i buy mutual funds that outperform the s p 500 and my portfolio mix that i just outlined as pretty much always beats the market because i buy funds that outperform the market it's not that hard to do you open up the prospectus and there's two little lines on the graph one of them is the s p 500 if the mutual fund you're looking at if that line is below that s p 500 line don't buy that bun this is hard really not that much to this but dave you just tell people buy those loaded funds yeah they'll pay a commission that's fine have somebody in your life helping you do the investing all the data says that you'll continue to invest doing that but when you out there by yourself with all your theories and some idiot newscaster comes on the evening news predicting the end of the world what do you do you cash out all your mutual funds at exactly the wrong time because you don't have anybody in your corner saying don't jump don't jump instead you're just out there with your own emotions in the newscaster and that's how you pick out when you jump in or out of the market and that's just dumb so all the data says a decent portfolio of good performing mutual funds wins and the big thing is actually putting money into the mutual funds actually investing one piece of research shows that 74 of the reason of retirement success is doing it it's called savings rate the number of you that put money in versus talk about it and continually put money in year after year year after year year after year month after month week after week out of your check into your 401k over and over and over and over and over again this is how you get wealthy it's ludicrous i know a lot about mutual funds and let me tell you i pick mutual funds about 80 percent of the choice on my mutual fund 85 is based on its rate of return its track record if the track record's tied and i'm trying to look i look for the longest track record who's been doing it a long time i like neighborhoods with big oak trees when i'm buying real estate you see what i'm saying i like a long track record something stable i don't like risk i like to make money risk equals not making money for me big risk anyway we said spread it across four types growth and income growth aggressive growth and international let's talk about those for a second because there's all kinds of names for mutual funds and the name of the mutual fund tells you what is in the fund okay a growth and income fund is also called a large cap fund sometimes also called a blue chip fund now the blue chip is the most expensive chip on the poker table so that means these are big companies in this large cap is short for large capitalization large capitalization means these are large companies and so your growth and income funds are large companies boring of the four types of mutual funds that i put money into and i recommend this is the calmest if you were to chart this volatility on this fund versus the stock market you would see it's a lot calmer than the market and so it's your friend when things are going down in other words it's your stable it's the big old dinosaur companies they're boring when things are going up by the way it's also boring it's not exciting when things are going up it's a downer you look at that thing going why is it not doing well when the rest of the market's going up because it goes slower than the market up and slower than the market down because it's a stable land a growth fund is right in the middle the s p 500 index fund would be considered a growth fund a growth fund is companies that are growing they're kind of medium-sized companies so you might hear it call mid cap fund these are just standard growth stock mutual funds there's a whole lot of these out there ton of funds that fall in this area the idea is pretty simple the growth fund that's kind of right there in the middle you want something in the middle it's pretty much going to do about what the market does in terms of volatility but you can get mutual funds that are growth stock mutual funds that outperform the s p 500 you can even get growth in income funds even though they're not as volatile that outperform the s p 500 then there's the aggressive growth fund this is the wild brother okay it's the crazy one and so you might guess it's going to be also called a small cap funds these are the small companies the startups a lot of tech companies would fall into there very crazy all the fun weird stuff is in there and that means some of it fails and goes to zero and so it's a crazier mix it's gonna be much more volatile than the stock market is so it's gonna go up faster than the market goes up but it's going to go down faster than the market goes down small cap aggressive growth stock mutual funds also known in there as a merging market you would call it that too as well international funds means that the stocks in it are overseas companies they're not american companies it has a kissing cousin called a global fund if you think of a globe what is it it's everything so that would have international and u.s companies in a global fund and it would be a cousin to an international by the way american companies generally outperform other international companies by and large as a group and so your international fund will be your worst performing of the four over the last several decades and a global fund will outperform an international fund because you put some spice in there you put some american companies in there usually and so they're a little bit better but at least you got some stuff overseas you're not a hundred percent betting on the american economy not that i'm anti-american i am not this is not a patriotic thing this is a diversification thing and so you know you want to have some bmw and some mercedes in there you want to have some lg and some other stuff even though some of those things are made stateside those are foreign companies and so you look for companies that are overseas based could be a french company could be whatever that are in an international fund and then you spread your investing across those four types very simple here the thing is do it that's the thing everybody talks and talks and talks and talks and talks about investing the problem is nobody does it people we talk to on the millionaire theme hour that are millionaires you know they got to be millionaires they did it and they never want to ask them how they became millionaires they never say oh man i hit the home run they never say that because it never happens oh dave i hit the home run i got this mutual fund that went straight up and i made all my money and one goodbye you know my golfing buddy gave me a stock tip i don't meet millionaires that did that i hear stories about it but a golfing buddy with a stock tip is like a golfing buddy with a fishing story the one that got away i mean it's just everybody's got an opinion and it's all a bunch of crap and so you just have to really stop and go slow and steady actually investing is the way it's the way it's the only way to go so growth and income growth aggressive growth international don't chase the returns do not invest money in things you do not understand people get ripped off when they invest money in things that someone told them is good and they trusted the person instead of knowing what the flip they were doing you know all these athletes you read about the nfl stars and they lost 10 million dollars or they made 100 million dollars and it's all gone and you know you know how they lose their money because they give it to someone else to handle and they don't even look at it and then they're shocked to find out that person was a crook that's how you lose your money it's your money it's like it's your kids which means you have to make it behave it's like you have to make your kids behave you have to do that if you want good kids that's how it's going to happen if you want money that's how it's going to happen you have to understand it now you don't have to have a master's degree in finance this stuff is not rocket science it is really not that difficult you really really seriously have to do this and you have to understand what the money is going into do not put money in that's why when you're buying insurance when you're getting a mortgage doing your investing in mutual funds that's why when you do all of that that you have to understand what you're doing and the only way you're going to do that is when you're picking someone to help you in one of those areas you're doing your estate plan if it's complicated you're doing your taxes if they're complicated that kind of thing you need someone sitting on the other side of the table that is not a salesperson but they have the heart of a teacher not the heart of a salesperson i'm an easy sale once i understand something but until i understand it i'm not putting a dime in it i'm not going forward with this it's that simple

In this video, demonstrate how a person who starts investing in the stock market just a few years earlier can get many times more money during retirement and achieve financial freedom faster. All this happens due to the power of compounding in investing.  In this video, I talk about 3 friends where Rocky invests in his 20s. This amount seems like a big one to him at that stage, however, during his retirement, the portfolio grows so big that one-day fluctuation in the stock market is worth more than his entire invested amount.  Rocky was able to invest a huge portion of his salary early in his career because he invested in his mindset first (pay yourself first concept).  This is because he read the book: The Richest Man in Babylon and understood the concepts. So before you pay yourself by investing in your future, you must pay some attention to the amount of knowledge and wisdom you have about managing money and financial freedom. Because just like money has value, even time has got value which in finance, we call it, time value of money.  So first, Rocky starts investing with the help of SIP (systematic investment plan) in equity mutual funds (index funds) and then slowly transfers that money to direct stocks with his own knowledge by the time he reaches his 30s. No school teacher will ever teach this.  Hence,  Invest in your mindset, it pays the best interest and you can afford it in your 20s. .

Read whitepapers, analyze market trends, and follow credible sources to stay informed.  Diversify your portfolio: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investment across multiple cryptocurrencies to reduce risk and increase potential returns.  Invest only what you can afford to lose: Cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility, so it's important to invest only what you can afford to lose. Avoid investing money that you might need for your essential expenses.

just one thousand dollars in his investment company bakeshare hathaway when he took it over you would have over 21 million dollars today even with the recent market crash this is an average return of around 20 which exceeds the return of the s p 500 which has an average return of 10 yearly now how did warren buffett get such great results and become one of the richest men in the world these results came from investing in companies and following a set of key principles that we'll cover in this video so here are the six investing principles of warren buffett number one cash is never a good investment this is something that goes with your philosophy today get out of cash and get into assets because we don't know what's going to happen to the dollar well cash is always a bad investment i mean when people said cash is king a year ago i mean that's crazy i mean cash wasn't producing anything and it was sure to go down in value over time and then you always want to be sure you have enough i mean it's like oxygen you want to be sure it's around you know but you don't need to have you don't need to have excessive amounts of it around and cash we will always have enough cash around but anytime we have surplus cash around i'm unhappy i mean i would much rather have good businesses than cash and and we found a chance in the last year thereabouts to deploy we came in with something over 40 billion in cash and we've got about 20 billion now and we've had some earnings so we put a lot of cash to work and i like that no i'd much rather own a good business than have cash uh and it is a hedge against the dollar well you can say all assets are a hedge against the dollar i mean but all you know is that the dollar is going to be worthless 10 20 30 years from now i say worth less not worthless right you want to watch that but it will be you know unless that's true of almost every currency that i can think of the question is how much it depreciates in value but cash cash is not a place at that number two invest in productive assets so you could have a cube if you owned all the gold in the world you could have a cube that would be 67 or 68 feet uh on a side and you could get a ladder and you could climb up on top of it and you could say you know i'm sitting on top of the world and you know and i think you're king of the world you could you know you could follow it you could polish it you could you could do all these things with it stare at it but it isn't going to do anything now it's all you are doing when you buy that is that you're hoping that somebody else a year from now or five years from now will pay you more to own something that again can't do anything but you're hoping that the person then thinks that somebody else will buy something five years later from him there was you're betting on not just how scared people are now of paper money you're betting on how much they think a year from now people will be scared two years from then on the third category of asset is something that you value based on it's on its what it will produce what it will deliver you buy a farm because you expect a certain amount of corn or soybeans or cotton or whatever it may be to be to come your way every year and you decide how much you pay based on how much you think the asset itself will deliver over time and those are the assets that appeal to me and charlie now there's some logical follow-on to that if you buy that farm and you really think about how many bushels of corn how many bushels of soybeans will produce how much do i have to pay the tenant farmer how much do i have to pay in taxes and so on you can make a rational calculation and the success of that investment will be determined in your own mind by whether it meets your expectations as to what it delivers logically you should not care whether you get a quote on that farm a day later a week later a month later or a year later we feel the same way about businesses when we buy this car or we buy lubrizol or whatever we don't run around getting a quote on it every week and say you know is it up or down or anything like that we look to the business we feel the same way about securities when we buy marketable security we don't care if the stock exchange closes for a few years so when we look at berkshire we are looking at what we think can be delivered from the productive assets that we own and how we can utilize that capital in acquiring more productive assets number three stay in your circle of competence defining your circle of competence is the most important aspect of investing it's not how important how large your circle is you don't have to be an expert on everything but knowing where the perimeter of that circle of what you know and what you don't know is and staying inside of it is all important tom watson senior who started ibm said in his book he said i'm no genius i said but i'm smart in spots and i stay around those spots and you know that is the key so if i understand a few things and i stick in that arena i'll do okay and if i don't understand something but i get all excited about it because my neighbors are talking about stocks are going up and everything they start fooling around someplace else eventually i'll get cream and i should number four evaluate companies first you can't keep always trying for the average person who's maybe never bought a stock before what's your advice about that you can't constantly sit there and wait and say oh it's going to go higher it's going to go higher we don't even think about that what we think about is how much is it selling for how much do we think it's worth when we bought it at 35 billion effectively i felt the company was probably worth at least 100 billion how did it come to your attention how do you find a stock like petrochina i sit there in my office and i read an annual report which fortunately was in english and it described a very good company and uh told about the oil reserves told about the refining tool about the chemicals everything else and i sat there and read it and i thought to myself this company's worth about 100 billion now i didn't look at the price first i look at the business first and trying to figure out what it's worth because if i look at the price first i'll get influenced by that so i look at the i look at the company first i try to value it and then i look at the price and if the price is way less than what i've just valued at that i'm going to buy it number five play big and don't waste opportunities all mission is way bigger than combination there's big opportunities in life have to be seized now we don't do very many things but when we get the chance to do something that's right and big we've got to do it and even to do it in a small scale is just as big a mistake almost is not doing it at all i mean you've really gotta you gotta grab them when they come because they you're not going to get 500 great opportunities you would be better off if when you got out of school here you got a punch card with 20 punches on it and every big financial every financial decision you made you used up a punch you'd get very rich because you'd think through very hard each one i mean he went to a cocktail party and somebody talked about a company he didn't even understand what they did or couldn't pronounce the name but they made some money last week and another one like it you wouldn't buy it if you only had 20 punches on that card there's a temptation to dabble if particularly during bull markets in stocks it's so easy you know it's easier now than ever because you can do it online you know just you click it in and maybe it goes up to point and get excited about that you buy another one the next day and so on you can't make any money over time doing that but if you had a punch card with only 20 punches you weren't going to get another one of the rest of your life you would think a long time before every investment decision and you would make good ones and you'd make big ones and you probably wouldn't even use all 20 punches in your lifetime but you wouldn't need to number six invest in yourself the best boat you can have is your own talent you know i mean it's they can't they can't take it away from you they inflation can't take it from you taxes can't take it from you so i i when i talk to students i see these students and i tell them you know you're a million dollar asset i would pay you a hundred thousand dollars the mbas for 10 of the earnings for the rest of your life so that makes you a million dollar asset now if you can do something increase that value 50 if you can learn to communicate better verbally or in written form and you become 50 more that's 500 000 just by improving yourself i mean not nobody can take that away from you and and so i urge everybody you know and then i talk to him in high school about this and and and colleges just do develop develop the habits you've got the brain power you've got the energy but develop the habits of success and then look around you at the people that you admire you know and list what makes you admire them compared to somebody else that looks equally strong or equally talented and those are those are things that you can do i mean just write them down and and and uh you know people like people that are there they like them if they're that they're humorous and they're friendly if they're if they're uh if they give credit to the other fellow i mean i and and they don't like them if they're stingy you know or they overstate and over promise and all those sort of things well that's decision that's a decision you make so so i i encourage everybody to build your own moat around yourself all right guys i wanted to start this series for us to learn from some of the most successful people in the world and absorb their knowledge every single week in the comments below let me know who would you like me to

inquiries only: elenataberyt@gmail.com,69057.0,1383338,5031,[Music] hi hello how's it going my name's elena and welcome to my channel i don't see a whole lot of young people especially women talking about finances and i think it's such an important topic to be able to become financially independent free and empowered i was a business major in university and so i have a little bit of experience from that as well as just research i've done on my own this video is really fun for me because i honestly probably put like 25 hours of research into this to make sure i'm sharing helpful information so i went to a bunch of experts gathered tidbits from them and wanted to make it in one concise nicely packaged video to share some basic information for you this has been a fun process for me because i've learned alongside you and i'm going to share some of my personal experience as well so if you have little to no knowledge about investing but you want to learn more and you want to learn how to invest your money then this video is for you i'm also going to include some other great resources in the description below to learn from if you want to dive further which i highly recommend i'm going to talk through some terms for those of you that maybe don't really have any knowledge of finances or financial terminology and then kind of go through some different steps as well as some great ways to start investing your money today also stay tuned for later i'm going to be talking about stocks and that section video is sponsored by robinhood which is a platform i am a big fan of coming up soon as well as talking about some other ways to invest your money so before you considering investing you need to kind of take a look at your finances and i highly recommend trying to follow these steps first and foremost it's very important to have an emergency fund i talked about this in one of my other financial videos but this is just a great rule of thumb you never know what's gonna happen i mean we're literally living through a pandemic if that doesn't show to you enough that you never know what's gonna happen if you need emergency savings in case you lose your job or something just look at the news across the board it's recommended that you least have a month of money in your savings for an emergency and then to slowly grow that to three months to six months the second step is to pay off debt it's very important to eliminate debt as soon as you can because that's going to set you back in the long term and with any high interest rate debt you want to get rid of that before you start making any big investments because that's just money that's gonna keep going down the drain if you don't address it the third is to open a retirement account and i think i'm gonna make a whole separate video on this again as i've talked about the past i am a passionate advocate of starting your retirement as soon as possible i personally started mine when i was 19 i opened a target retirement fund account through vanguard so basically there's different types of retirement accounts some of the most popular ones are 401ks and roth iras so a 401k is generally set up through your workplace so if you're working a nine to five or some other type of job with benefits there's a chance you have a 401k retirement account so a 401k in itself is an account that holds investments so if you're a 401k through your job you're investing you're doing great you're preparing for your future i'm proud of you so a 401k is a tax advantaged retirement account where you put money in and your company is going to most likely match to a certain percentage how much money you put in through this you're automatically being invested in a mixture of stocks and bonds through mutual funds which we will break down in just a second there's also roth ira accounts which is another retirement savings account that allows your money to grow tax-free [Music] so let's break down a little bit of those terms so if you're unfamiliar with what stocks bonds the stock market is let's talk about it i'm going to try to make it as simple as possible so a stock is an investment that represents a share and a company so let's take facebook for example you can buy a stock of facebook which means you basically own a little piece of facebook's big old pie and so as that company grows your stock is going to grow slowly with facebook the stock market that you always hear people freaking out about is the marketplace for stocks and where stocks are held so it shows all the different shares of company ownership and how they're performing overall the interesting thing about the stock market is that it's generally controlled by investors emotions so people are starting to freak out because let's say there's a pandemic they're going to want to pull their money out and sell those stocks and shares and if a bunch of people do that at once that's going to cause it to drop but then as soon as they're starting to feel like okay you know this is good i'm going to reinvest my money in the stock market the stock market's going to go back up you often hear people talking about investing with risk versus reward so you're going to have to risk more if you want a higher reward and want to try to get more money but there's also a lower risk investments which means you're going to have a smaller reward profit margin so you're going to make less but you're risking less as well so a bond is something that falls in that kind of low risk category a bond is a contract with a company or the government we're essentially loaning them your money and so it's very predictable and over a long period of time with that loan you're gonna make a little bit of money off of it so it's considered a low risk investment funds is basically a big old bowl of stocks and bonds etc so i was watching a video and someone explained it buying a stock is like buying one single flower but buying a fund is like buying the whole damn bouquet with all the bunch of different flowers so there's different kinds of funds and the ones i'm going to be talking about primarily today are index funds and mutual funds so mutual funds came along first and like i said earlier a fund is a big old bowl or bouquet of stocks and bonds and it's managed by an investor so some very smart guy or girl who understands the stock market is managing a fund or mutual fund and they using their brain and their knowledge of the market is selecting which stocks bonds etc they think are going to be the best investments to include in the bouquet so basically you're owning a bunch of stocks in one package so there's more diversification because if you're to invest in one stock let's say you buy a whole bunch of facebook and facebook just plummets all your money is gonna go down with facebook that's why it's very popular to hear that you need to diversify your portfolio basically don't put all your eggs in one basket mutual funds came along for that reason to be able to invest in stocks but to diversify across a larger like platform these are run like i said by some smart man or woman and they are gonna charge a big old fee maybe like one or two percent of your mutual funds so however much money you're putting in there you're paying them a little bit later along came index funds now i'm a big old fan of index fund so is warren buffett may i add one of the most successful investors in the world if you don't trust me trust warren buffett he knows what he's doing similarly an index fund is a portfolio of certain investments that you can buy into and then you own a little baby share of a whole bunch of different stocks and companies index is a representative sample of the stock market so it's similar to a mutual fund but instead of being run by some like fancy manager it's passively managed by a formula so instead of like a mutual fund where you're trying to beat the market you're basically trying to match the market so big difference is that you don't have that mutual fund manager so you're gonna cut out a whole lot of costs so index fund is something that you usually invest in you're gonna sit on for a while and not touch it one thing to keep in mind is all index funds are mutual funds but not all mutual funds are index funds it's kind of confusing i know basically the way this grows is through compounding interest which is basically reinvesting your interest into your initial loan or investment on mutual funds there's no interest paid but you might have dividends or capital gains reinvested to compound over time so looking at investor.gov here here's a compounding interest calculator to get an idea of how this would work let's say you put a thousand dollars in index fund let's say you put like a hundred dollars a month length of time let's say 30 years say we're gonna put out a hopeful eight percent and calculate annually look at this number you originally put in just 37 000 of your own cash and because of compounding interest it grows to 146 000 in 30 years so imagine if you were to put in a higher number of an initial investment more money each month or to do an account that has a bit of a higher annual rate of return [Music] okay so now you know a little bit more term so we can dive into some of the best ways to invest like i said earlier putting money into an entire recount is a great way of investing highly recommend it the sooner you start the better retirement accounts like a roth ira you max out i believe it's around six thousand dollars is the max you can put in a year so let's just say you make a ton of money one year and you want to invest a lot of it you're a little bit limited when it comes to that retirement account but even if you don't have that much money to put into investment which i'm sure is quite a few of you guys don't worry just put in a little bit every single month and it will pay off so now you know make sure you have emergency savings pay off any big old debt that you have invest in your retirement let's talk about some different ways to invest so when it comes to investing like i mentioned earlier there's different approaches you might want to be more high risk high reward that could be somebody that's trading in stocks and is much more hands-on and then there's also a more passive a little bit lower risk approach like investing in an index fund so there's different types of index funds you may have heard of like the s p 500 that's a super popular one so what is the s p 500 then so glad you asked so the s p 500 index basically tracks the top 500 u.s companies if you're in a different country it's going to be different for you some of these basic principles hopefully apply to you so there's slightly different s p 500 funds depending on the brokerage account that you sign up with i personally signed up with vanguard which is a very popular one the vanguard is the originator of the index fund but there's many other options to choose from like charles swab or fidelity make sure to do your own research everything in this video you gotta check it out for yourself i am by no means telling you what to do i'm here to provide information for you to further learn for yourself so i personally have been investing with vanguard for quite some time they don't have the best interface it's kind of confusing to use they're a really good place to invest because they have very low expense ratios so that means if i want to invest in an index fund i only have to pay them a very small percentage like point zero four percent so here's a story that i love that gives a little bit more credit to the s p 500 warren buffett basically bet a million dollars that an index fund would outperform a collection of hedge funds over 10 years a decade passed and he won so all these different hedge funds trying to beat the market trying to time it trying to see when the stocks are going to go up and down to make the most amount of money they didn't win putting your money in an index fund and just letting it chill and slowly ride the wave of the stock market did the best and you don't have to know a whole lot you just put your money into one and you sit back and you don't touch it and you let it ride the weight so the s p 500 tracks the top 500 companies and so it lets you sprinkle your little investments across the top 500 but a total stock market fund is gonna let you sprinkle all the way to the top of the big companies but also to little companies so that is a brief overview of index funds these come highly recommended any decision you make you have to make for yourself put in the time and research just your finances make sure you're learning for yourself the goal of them is not to just put money in and then take it out in six months and hope it's grown a lot it's about putting in for years if not decades and letting it grow over time and then take it out when you're ready to buy a house or you're ready to retire the best time to invest was yesterday i kept hearing that in my research and i'm like it's true you got to put that money in as soon as possible you put the money in consistently you don't touch it don't even really look at it and just let it grow trying to time the market is very hard and honestly don't trust yourself so it's about putting in a little bit of money each month and like i said just don't touch it so now let's talk about stocks a little bit more and a potential for higher risk high reward so you probably have heard of people talking about investing in this stock or that stock or whatever that may be and making money and being lucky because they invested in apple the right time or something like that so that's when stocks into come into play they are a riskier investment but you're able to make potentially a lot more it's harder to do and it's going to take time to learn but there can be really incredible payoffs the nice part is that socks in general do trend upwards there's gonna be dips and it's gonna probably rise two thirds of the time and then like drop a third of the time so you basically gotta stick with it so if you wanna get a little bit more specific there are some apps that are out there that are really great that let you invest a small amount of money from anywhere so you get a really good feel of the stock market and kind of learn what you're doing and get more comfortable with it like i said index funds are great for a lot of people out there but if you are willing to take the time and you really want to learn well then give individual stocks a try so robin are just sponsoring this part of the video specifically which i'm excited about i've been a fan of their services i've had quite a few family and friends refer me to robin hood and i've dabbled with it a little bit to learn more about how to buy individual stocks of course as with everything in this video look it up for yourself make your own financial decisions so one of the best selling points that i've heard time and time again is just that the interface is so clean and easy to use and great for beginners so the cost of certain stocks can be really intimidating but like amazon is close to 3 000 tesla's close to like 1 5 452 which is a lot you invest in stocks options etfs right from your phone you're gonna earn interest on uninvested cash there's no commission fees or account minimum so whether you are new to investing and ready to learn or you just want an easier interface experience i highly recommend you check out robinhood i've leaved in the description below there's millions of users on there and when you sign up you get a free stock so go to this url and sign up to claim your free stock today all right so

Warren Buffett | How To Invest For Beginners: 3 Simple Rules",51246.0,3156690,6365,i had started investing when i was 11. i just dithered away until when i was seven or eight nine but so unfortunately i didn't get started till i was 11. but i bought my first stock when i was 11 and then i experimented with a whole bunch of things like timing of stocks and charting and doing all these crazy things it was a lot of fun profitless but a lot of fun and i did that until i was 19. and i read all the books on investing in the public library and just i ate it up it was fascinating to me but i had no framework i was just searching for something i was hoping that little things on a chart would tell me something about what a stock was going to do it was kind of crazy but everybody else was doing it so i figured i'd do it too sometimes you turn the chart upside down you know it still wouldn't help then in 1949 i read the intelligent investor by ben graham i'd never heard of them up until then and there are really only two chapters in that book that are the key to it but they set my philosophical framework for investing in three ways they're so basic and so simple it's hard to understand how they could be that important but the ten commandments are simple you know the first is that a stock is part of a business i mean you you can't think of a sock as something different it's you value a business and then you divide by the shares outstanding but what you have to think about is what kind of a business are you getting into what are its economic characteristics for its competitors what's its management like all of these things that relate to a business instead of a little ticker symbol i used to know when i was 11 or 12 the ticker symbols of every company virtually on the new york stock exchange i could mark the boards of harris up them you know but i didn't know anything i mean i could you know i knew that x was u.s steel and t was at t and so on but i didn't i didn't know anything i didn't know what was behind them so i had to start looking at at these little symbols or these little names in the paper as businesses and decide how do you value a business what counts the second thing in that in the book is that graham gives you a marvelous set point in terms of how the investor should react to stock market fluctuations he talks about his mythical mr market in chapter eight there's been no better thing written in terms of the investors attitude toward stock prices most people react the wrong way to stock prices i mean they feel good when their stocks go up they feel bad when they go down they think the stock market is there to instruct them and mr market is this partner you have in investing you know he's a remarkably obliging partner this guy comes around every day and he tells you what he'll pay you for your interest in the business or what he'll sell you more at the same price nobody ever does that in in private business if you owned you and i owned a gas station together and i said every day i want you to come in and offer me your half interest in the station and i can either buy your half or sell you my my half at the same price and you have to come in every day and do it you'd be at a terrible disadvantage and you'd be at a particular disadvantage if you're mr market in the market because mr market or a friend of the market who obligingly gives you those figures every day different figures at the end of the day in the start of the day but he's naming a price at which you'll either buy herself the beautiful thing about him is that this guy is an alcoholic manic depressive i mean i mean he is as unsound as they come he wanders around all day you know and looks at the crazy things and he you know he he's going to name all kinds of crazy prices and you don't have to pay any attention to them except when it's to your advantage to do so if that's once a year if it's once every five years it's one stock out of three thousand all you have to do is sit there there you have no moral responsibility to this jerk you know i mean he is naming these numbers you didn't ask him to but he's doing it and all you have to do is pick the one time when he is particularly depressed or particularly manic or particularly drunk or whatever it may be and the market will be all of those things and and you take advantage of it and that's what's remarkable about stocks if you think about it is that if you look at the high and low on all of these american companies for the last year you'll see case after case after case where the high is twice below now that's for sound american businesses running along paying people selling goods and so on if you go out look at farmland 10 miles from here there's no way in the world over here that the farmland is going to range in value from x to 2x it doesn't maybe go from x to 110 of x or vice versa if you look at an apartment house near here and figures on essentially apartment houses like that over a year it won't it won't move 10 in a given year but here are the finest of american businesses and people just name these numbers that go all over the place and you don't have to play except when you want to that's the important thing and that's the that's what graham tells you the market isn't there to instruct you to tell you anything the markets is there just basically to serve you when you want it to serve you you know one of the most important things remember in stocks very hard to do but people have all these feelings about it the stock doesn't know you own it you know you're sitting there with these certificates for berkshire the company doesn't even know you own it you know and the stock doesn't it's trading now and they don't know you own it so it has no feelings about you i mean you've got all these feelings about it but it's just part of a business if berkshire is worth 75 000 times a million and a half shares you know roughly 110 billion or something like that it's a good investment if it isn't it's a lousy investment you know you have to value the business and graham you know it's amazing but people don't do that in wall street you bet you you hear price targets or that kind of thing but you see no one write a paper that says here is the nature of this business over the next 20 years you know what will that what should that business sell for forget about what it's selling for in fact one of the things i always like to do when i'm looking at investments is i like to look at them without knowing the price because if you see the price it automatically has some influence on you if you just sit down with the reports if i get an idea about looking up a company and i get these 10ks and so on i would rather not know the price because i'd rather value it without knowing the price when i used to handicap horses when i was a kid one of the things i would do is i'd get the racing form ahead of time and if there were nine horses in a race will say obviously the probabilities of of each one winning the race had to add up to 100 percent i mean one horse was going to win the race absent a dead heat or all of them dropping dead on the backstretch so if you went through the racing form and i would look at the third race at hialeah i would try to figure out the percentage chance of each horse winning the race and that had to add to 100 then i would compare those percentages to the odds but i first of all i wouldn't look at the odds first i would look at the past performance and all that thing first stock market's the same way third thing in graham's book is the margin of safety if you come up to a bridge and it says capacity ten thousand pounds and you're driving a 9 800 pound truck you drive down further and find another bridge i mean you know they nobody knows exactly what that capacity is and it may have been signed may have been put up three years ago so you always leave a margin of safety you don't try to cut things that close you wait till something kind of shouts at you in the stock market and uh with those three principles you can build all kinds of all kinds of structures on that but that's the foundation and if you've got that in mind and that's in the intelligent investor i've never found anything that remotely compares with all three of the ones i just you can't get rid of one leg of the three-legged stool and still have a good investment philosophy but i would say that the most important thing uh over a long period and working with big money uh is to understand the business let's just say for the moment that you were given a million dollars or whatever some was necessary and you could look around knoxville or look around all of tennessee if you want and buy into any three businesses you know between now and a week from now private businesses not trading or anything of the sort you've got a week to do it or you have to give the money back what will you be doing during the next week i mean you can look at all these companies some of them you're quite familiar with some of them you're less familiar with some you know by reputation some of them you know the management some of them you know you know their competitive situation what will you be thinking about during that seven day period how will you actually be screening these companies out i think you look for three businesses and you can't trade them after you buy them you're just gonna you're gonna own the rest of your life you're gonna be looking for businesses that have enduring competitive advantage you don't want to buy a burger king franchise just because nobody's come within 10 miles of it yet because you know wendy's and donald's and all of those will be there pretty soon it isn't necessarily who's earning the most money now you're going to look for something with enduring competitive advantage now that takes a business with some kind of a moat around it because capitalism by definition is a system where every time somebody has an economic castle somebody else is going to come after it's just the nature if you open a restaurant that's successful here in town you know somebody's going to take your menu and probably take your chef maybe cut your price maybe offer a little more parking maybe be a better better okay whatever i mean capitalism consists of going after the other guy's castle if that's the case you want a castle with a big moat around it there's a lot of ways you can have a motor on something you could have it by patent protection you could have it by location in certain certain areas i mean if you have something in people's mind like coca-cola six billion people in the world practically all of them have something in their mind about coca-cola largely favorable they don't have anything in their mind about rc cola and if rc cola spent a billion dollars advertising they wouldn't have anything in their mind about rc cola but they've got something in their mind about coke and generally it's favorable that's why coke wants to be where people are happy because they want to be at the theater they want to be at disney world they want to be at the world series they want always have you drinking that drink of coca-cola while at the same time experiencing happiness and if they do that they're going to sell a lot of coca-cola and it won't make any difference if somebody is a half a cent less of some serving than coke so that's an enduring competitive advantage and you want it run by honest enabled people don't want to go in with a crook and you don't want to go in with a dope now the best businesses to buy are the ones where you could have a dope in there i mean peter lynch says you know buy a business that's so good that an idiot can run it because sooner or later one will you know and and there's some merit to that uh in fact i got a question the other day from this student group and they said you know what's going to happen to berkshire when you go gaga and i said well berkshire's so good that i can go gaga in fact i may even be you know those are the kind of businesses to own so you want but you want a management that's able and honest and then you want a price that's sensible and that's what you'd look for you go around tennessee got a week to do it and you'd immediately screen out a whole bunch of things you just know that they weren't a fertile area you know that's an important thing to be able to do to know just get rid of all kinds of things there was a great article in the new yorker 30 years ago when bobby fischer was playing spassky in famous chess match which drew attention around the world and they examined how the mind could with billions and billions and billions of possibilities how it could group things so it immediately cast it down to where you had like four options and of course when the humans play something like deep thought you know or whatever the latest version is of the computer on that that computer is making maybe 700 000 or a million calculations a second and the human mind is competing against that but the computer is checking every possibility and the human mind somehow has this ability to cast out 99.999 percent of those things that the computer has to go through in order to focus on the three or four possibilities that really make sense and invest things a lot like that's not that tough because there aren't that many companies but you want to cast out all kinds of things if somebody told me that my life depended on picking among the dow jones stocks a group of 10 that would be the best performers or outperform the index as a whole i would spend my time thinking of the worst up companies in there i would cast out things and then i would figure i left those behind and that's an easier way to approach the problem actually than than trying to pick the 10 best if you were thinking about the state of tennessee you know there's a whole lot of things you wouldn't examine you just figure they're too tough you might decide you know car dealerships were too tough it's always going to be competitive who knows whether ford or general motors are going to be selling more cars five years now or whether there's me terrorists on foreign who knows so you just say i'll give up on car dealers i'll pick your budget i'll think about something else and that approach that you use there is the same approach you really want to bring the stock market you've got 3 000 companies tonight you can look at on the new york stock exchange there's a valuation on every one of them it'll change tomorrow you don't have to play once a year if you have 20 good if you have five good ideas in your lifetime to get very rich you know i i tell students sometimes they'd be better off if they had a punch card when they got out of school with only 20 punches on it because then instead of listening to somebody at a cocktail party and then glass the next morning buying some shirts they'd really think about every punch that's all the punches you get 20 punches is plenty you just have to make sure that you don't do any of them for frivolous reasons we never want to buy anything small at berkshire it just doesn't make any difference you know we want to think about things that can move the needle and that gets tougher as the capital gets greater but that's the way to focus on investments

time the markets have always gone up¬†¬† and just have confidence that things will recover¬† as the afternoon was approaching people were¬†¬† getting less interested in talking to me and after¬† being rejected over a hundred times i had truly¬†¬† reached my breaking point that might have been the¬† coldest rejection i got so far and even though it¬†¬† was painful it was actually great talking to¬† all these people but i was looking for a real¬†¬† wall street legend and for that there was only¬† one place i could go you know well you know we¬†¬† got all dressed up and everything to try to come¬†

shouldn't be looking at the prices i think¬†¬† we will be falling for the next few months but i¬† will be looking at the great companies like tesla¬†¬† amazon nvidia all the companies that in five years¬† from now will still be rocketing to all-time highs¬†¬† and slowly averaging down however not overdoing¬† myself averaging slowly to extent where i don't¬†¬† feel overextended inside the market

point i thought we¬† were good i mean we had secured an interview¬†¬† with a big dog on wall street but unfortunately¬† i legally can't say if we went in there or not¬†¬† even if we literally did get invited to¬† go inside which i'm not saying we did¬†¬† a week after i got home i was told i am not¬† allowed to use any of the footage at first¬†¬† i was gonna scrap this whole video i'm¬† just like sad i'm like super bummed like¬†¬† yeah we'll figure something out but we came such¬† a long way i couldn't go out like that so instead¬†¬† of throwing this whole interview away i had an¬† idea so first off how long have you been coming¬†¬† to the stock machine i came here in 1985. got you¬† and you've seen a lot since then a lot of crashes¬†¬† a lot of recessions how does this current dip in¬† the market relate to those do you see a similarity¬†¬† or it's way different i've seen the crash of 87¬† the bubble of 2000 the financial crisis of 07.¬†¬† you know the crazy years under professor orange¬† over there and then i've seen uh kobe crack¬†¬† i think this has components to it that i can¬† describe that i've never seen before no one's¬†¬† ever really had a health crisis this way before¬† the economies of the world were shut down to zero¬†¬† the airline restaurant hospitality travel this¬† that and the other thing were basically done¬†¬† the federal reserve bailed us out¬† but

that's not what i do i understand there's¬†¬† no better time to learn about the market and¬† invest and trade the market then during a crisis¬†¬† because the volatility makes for great learning¬† experience if you're an investor looking to get¬†¬† into the market for the first time you've got to¬† learn how to do this you can make money on an up¬†¬† market and a down market markets do go up and¬† down we really appreciate it my pleasure first¬†¬† day on wall street was a huge success but honestly¬† all this suit is like uncomfortable and i don't¬†¬† know if this lifestyle is for me so i

let me explain what happened here that was the Einstein of Wall Street I didn't know that and I was asking this man how much he makes per year with a simple Google search the Einstein of Wall Street

comes to money and investing hope you enjoy what's up guys it's me Kareem Jovian and I'm here in Wall Street gonna ask New Yorkers on investment advice let's see what they give us what's your name where are you from my name is Jan Steiner Wall Street I'm from New York I'm a Trader on the floor of the stock exchange how much do you make per year or someone in your position makes I would not even consider telling what advice would you give someone who wants to make money well first I think the best advice is to find something you really love to do then you won't have to work a day in your life and there's a lot of stuff out here you can find excitement in whether it's branding marketing Wall Street trading investing and do you think anyone can be rich you know what Rich it's defined by a lot of different things you know you can be rich without having a lot of money obviously money is nice to have it gives you some freedom but um anybody can be read sure you have persistence if you have determination if you find gratitude in your life on a daily basis if you create a team around you of people who Empower you and support you then you're rich and then if you find something you love to do then you get some money on top of it it's good to go does money buy happiness absolutely not by no means you could scrape the Earth and find more people who've had a whole shitload of money who have never been able to find happiness the two are absolutely have nothing to do with each other amazing thank you so much for your time I appreciate it what's your name where are you from um Keon from New Jersey how much do you make per year I want to say 90 to 100 000. what's the best way for you to make money I'm a marketing associate at a Direct Mail company what investment advice can you give someone I don't know because I don't invest what's your name and where are you from my name is Summer Lyons and I live here in New York City and how much do you make per year um I'm in sales so hopefully about 150. how much do you pay per month for your rent or mortgage 4 200. is there any advice you could give to someone who would want to invest or make the same amount of money you're making one I would say if you were young live at home as long as you can save your money get roommates don't go out and blow your money on stupid things to look cool because you're young and that's the way like social media you know comes comes across I mean I guess just be smart with your money invest it uh put it away I'm pretty impulsive when it comes to things so if I have my money right in front of me like I will spend it so putting it away and then just making like wise investment choices and what do you invest in um so I'm in cyber security uh sales so knowing like you know the different kind of vendors and like where the Market's going with that well obviously the stock market's kind of yeah so since it's going crazy but how are you going around not looking at it okay what's your name and where are you from Andre the noon I was born here but when I was seven I went to South Africa and I came back in 2017. nice and what's your profession how much do you make for someone your position make per year 120 that was and how much do you pay for rent for much looking about going on six thousand or so do you have any investment advice for someone who maybe wants to make the same amount of money as you pay yourself first second don't worry about the now think further than tomorrow think past tomorrow that's the best thing I can tell you because in this in the long term you're gonna mean a lot don't worry about the no the now is gonna seem so hectic and you seem so crashed everything is going down it's not working out in the long run it looks bad now as long as you plant the seeds lay the soil lay the foundation be good to go hi what's your name and where are you from I'm Joan catab from East Greenwich Rhode Island and I'm an independent financial advisor for someone who wants to be you know in your profession how much do they make give or take per year I mean the starting if you're on a commission basis at the beginning maybe 50 000 but then there's no upward limit as a person who worked on Wall Street for over 30 years at Wall Street firms but outside of New York as a woman and as a parent of children of color I would say that the large firms are good for training but I have found that they do not provide equal opportunity now despite their adds to the contrary so I would say get your training maybe at a big firm get your Certified Financial Planning designation and then go to an independent clearing firm and start your own business don't waste your career on the big firms and can anyone be rich I think hopefully so I mean you do your hard work but we all have different opportunities and you never know what can happen focus on what you can control yourself your education asking others for help sometimes they'll give it to you sometimes not and being optimistic and when people uh put obstacles in your way just keep on thinking ways around those obstacles because brains and talent are equally spread among Humanity what's your name and where are you from hi uh my name is Kareem Syed I'm my name is Kareem too oh wow nice to meet you what's your profession uh I work in for an energy trading firm I work in uh sort of a strategy risk management and operations so someone in your profession in your field how much would they make give or take per year people can make anywhere from like uh 80 000 to a few hundred thousand dollars a year can anyone be rich I think anyone can be rich I believe that really the mains get the main skill to investing is a lot of independent research both learning from industry experts and I feel like the greatest Alpha is generated in learning when industry experts are wrong as they drive a lot of consensus and a lot of upside is derived from sort of finding contrarian views that are not contrarian for contrarian's sake or contrarian based on facts and research what's your name where you from Joey Valentin I'm from Boston live-in on Wall Street what's your profession I work for this company called frame IO I'm an account executive there someone in your position how much do they make give or take per year I make 75 base 150 with commission what's your advice for someone who wants to make something similar to what you're making for you keep networking pick up a skill if you can before work or after work and then just try to figure out what what you like does money buy happiness not necessarily but uh it helps what's your name where you from my name is Aaron I'm from Atlanta Georgia what's your profession I work in the legal field and it's someone in your position how much would they make I started out making as low as like 40 and now I'm up in the six figures and do you think money buys happiness I think money facilitates being happier I think there's a bell curve with it but the short is no why not um because happiness is more complicated than that it's more nuanced I think so someone who wants to be in your position what advice would you give them it's a lot about connection so I think I would network and try to be as personable and presentable as possible and just keep on trying after rejection my name is Randall from Maryland what's your profession I'm an accountant and someone in your position how much would they make per year 100 200 000 and do you have any advice for someone who wants to oh would you have any advice for anyone who would want to be in that position learn how to golf learn how to use Microsoft Excel I guess I don't know what's your profession I'm a Somali restaurant manager how much would they make roughly give or take it depends on everyone's position and how long you experience it so just says someone who wants to be in that profession what advice would you give them uh travel try as much wine try as much wine meet as many wine makers as you can and learn as much as you can and realize that your customers are people that you learn from as much as you give service to and then you could be in pretty good shape just be hungry for information do you think money buys happiness no but it don't hurt what's your name where you from my name is Alex Kim I grew up in New Jersey and I live in this building right here what's your profession I'm a bomb Trader I I work in that building right there and someone in your position roughly give or take how much do they make per year I'd rather not say but it's uh from what I understand it's not what it used to be but it's a good living it's better than I I'm very grateful to be in the situation I'm in you think money buys happiness then hell no it doesn't buy happiness hell no what's your name where are you from Stephen and I'm from Philadelphia originally but now I live in New York what's your profession I do Consulting for private Equity firms and in someone in your position how much would they make roughly give or take six figures around that 500k or more no not 500 camera I'm only 22. if I was making 500k I'd be somewhere else right now can anyone be rich yeah I think anyone can be rich um my mentor came from like a way worse place than I did and he's one of the wealthiest people I know so I think anyone can be rich you just have to believe in yourself you can't put a barrier on yourself and you gotta commit to it um and and envision yourself being rich that's a big part of it finally there's money by happiness yeah I so I wasn't the last video I heard that question I said yes but no it doesn't entirely by happiness uh the amount of money you make years and gonna buy happiness or like the job you have isn't gonna like if it's a certain amount of pay it's not gonna buy you happiness but I think if you love what you do that'll make you happy but I also think if you do make a lot of money and you're able to you know have that tool because money is like a really powerful tool I think yeah it generally makes people happier and being rich is hard but so is like being poor so if you're gonna choose between the two hearts I think being rich is a better hard yeah and I wouldn't say it buys you happiness but it can at least make your life a little easier and maybe take some stress off your back thank you guys so much for watching this video remember to hit that like button subscribe and turn on those notifications and in the comments below let me know what you would like me to ask New

it is we we started building this little snowball on top of a very long hill so we started a very early age and rolling the snowball down and of course the snowball the nature of compound interest is it behaves like a snowball of sticky snow and and the trick is to have a very long hill which means either starting very young or living very to be very old the i you know i would do it exactly the same way if i were doing it in the investment world i mean if i were getting out of school today and i had ten thousand dollars to invest i'd i'd start with eas i would start i would start going right through companies and i probably would focus on smaller companies because i would be working with smaller sums and there's more chance that something is overlooked in that arena uh and as charlie has said earlier it won't be like doing that in 1951 when you could leap through and find all kinds of things that that just left off the page at you but that's the only way to do it i mean you have to buy businesses and you or little pieces of business is called stocks and you have to buy them at attractive prices and and you have to buy them and you have to buy into good businesses and that advice will be the same 100 years from now in terms of investing that's that's what it's all about well if you're interested in business uh i definitely think you ought to learn all the accounting you can't all by the time you're in your early 20s uh accounting is the language of business now that doesn't mean it's a perfect language so you have to know the limitations of that language uh as well as all aspects of it so i would advise you to learn accounting and i would advise you to be in terms of part-time employment or anything else work at a number of businesses there's nothing like seeing how business operates to to build your judgment in the future about about businesses uh the you know when you understand what kind of things are very competitive and what kind of things are less competitive and why that works that way all of that adds to your knowledge so i would do a lot of reading if you're interested in investments i would hey i would take the accounting courses i do a lot of reading about investments and i would get as much business experience i would talk business with people that are in business to find out what they think makes their operation tick or where they have problems and why i just think you just kind of sop it up every place that you can if i were working with a small amount of money the universe would be huge compared to the universe of possible ideas i work with now you mentioned that 56 to 69 was the best period actually my best period was before that was from right after i met ben graham in 19 early 1951 but from the end of 1950 through the next 10 years actually returns averaged about 50 percent a year and i think they were 37 points better than the dow per year something like that but that i was working with a tiny tiny tiny amount of money and so i would pour through volumes of businesses and i would find one or two that i could put ten thousand dollars into or fifteen thousand dollars into that would just ridicul they were ridiculously cheap and obviously as the money increased the universe of possible ideas started shrinking dramatically the times were also better for doing it in that time but i i think that i think if you're working with a small amount of money with exactly the same background that charlie and i have and same ideas same same whatever ability we have you know i think you can make very significant sums but you but as soon as you start getting the money up into the millions many millions the the the curve on expectable results falls off just dramatically but that's that's the nature of it when you get up to things you can put millions of dollars into you've got a lot of competition looking at that and they're not looking as i did when i started when i started i went through the pages of the manuals page by page i mean i probably went through 20 000 pages uh in the moody's industrial transportation banks and finance manuals and i did it twice and i actually you know looked at every business i didn't look very hard at some well that's not a practical way to invest tens or hundreds of millions of dollars so i would say if you're working with a small sum of money that and you're really interested in in the business and willing to do the work you can you will find something if you were you there's no question about in my mind you will find some things that promise very large returns compared to what we will be able to uh deliver with large sums of money is business school worth it depends on the person much more than it depends on the school some people are going to get a lot out of advanced education and some people are going to get very little and i don't even think it's important that every person go to college at all we have all kinds of jobs at 70 or so thousand a year 80 000 a year that college training is not abuse and i actually was not keen on going to college myself yeah my dad kind of jollied me into it he could get me to do anything but i knew i could have a good time i liked investing and i could read the books you know it's a big commitment to take four years and the cost involved and maybe the loans involved and everything i think depending on what your interests are in life i don't think it's for everybody i think it's for a lot of people but there ought to be a reason you're going and i didn't really see much reason there's nothing like following your passion i mean i love what i do obviously and i've loved it the whole time i've done it charlie it's the same way we have managers you know they come some of them went to business school some of them didn't you know they they they're all types but the the common factor in the in in them is they love what they do you know and and you've got to find that in life and some people are very lucky in finding it very early i was you know i was dumb luck that my father happened to be in the securities business so when i would go to his office there were a lot of books to read and i got entranced with that but you know if he'd been in some other occupation i would i think i would have read those books eventually but it would have been a lot later so if you find something that turns you on my guess is you're going to do very well and the beauty of it is in a sense there's not that much competition i mean there are not a lot of people out there that are going to be running faster than you in the race that you elect to get into and if you haven't found it yet you may well have found it but if you haven't found it yet you've got to keep looking and we've got 70 plus managers you know some of them some of them didn't we had one guy that didn't go to high school charlie oh yeah he quit in fourth grade i think yeah well mrs b never went to school a day in her life you know and when you go out the furniture mark i hope you go out this evening we expect to set a record today in sales the uh what you are looking at on those 78 acres you know is the largest home furnishing store about 400 million of sales largest store in the united states and it comes from 500 dollars of capital paid in by a woman that never went to the school a day in her life and couldn't read or write you know i mean she loved what she was doing and you know i tell the story this is a true story when she was in well into her 90s she invited me over to her house for dinner that was very unusual and a very nice house six or seven blocks away from the store and i went into the house and the sofa the chairs the lamp the dining room table they all had little green price tags hanging down it made her feel at home and and i said to her mrs b you are my kind of woman yeah forget sophia iran i mean this is my kind of woman she loved us you know and she loved it all her life and just think of what that produced i mean it just it's incredible i mean you know one time my dad used to quote emerson that the power that lies within you is new in nature you know and basically the power that was within mrs b was new in nature and and over a lifetime it produced amazing things so find find your passion and then don't let anything stop you the biggest mistakes are the ones that actually don't show up they're the mistakes of omission rather than commission we've never lost that much money on any one investment uh but it's the things that i knew enough to do that i didn't do we have we have missed profits of as much as you know maybe 10 billion dollars in things that i knew enough to do and i didn't do now the fact i didn't buy microsoft way back uh is not a foregone opportunity because i didn't know enough to make that decision but there have been other investments where i didn't know enough to make the decision and for one reason or another i either didn't do it at all or i did it on a small scale i was sucking my thumb when i should have been writing checks you know basically and and you know those don't show up you know there's no place where it shows missed opportunities but i've i've missed some big ones you know i will take a person graduating from college and assuming their normal shape and everything i will be glad to pay them you know probably fifty thousand dollars for ten percent of all their earnings for the rest of their lives well if i'm willing to pay him ten percent for fifty thousand for ten percent that means they're worth five hundred thousand if they haven't got a dime in their pocket as long as they've got a good mind and a good body seventy years ago i was in high school almost a third as long as the country has been around and when i was in high school i really only had two things on my mind girls and cars and i wasn't doing very well with girls so we'll talk about cars but let's just imagine that when we finish i'm going to let each one of you pick out the car of your choice sounds good doesn't it uh pick it out any color you name it it'll be tied up with a bow and it'll be at your house tomorrow and you say well what's the catch and the catch is that it's the only car you're going to get in your lifetime now what are you going to do knowing that that's the only car you're ever going to have and you love that car you're going to take care of it like you cannot believe now what i'd like to suggest you're not going to get only one car in your lifetime but you're going to get one body and one mind and that's all you're going to get and that body and mind feels terrific now but it has to last you a lifetime the key is to is to certainly in terms of your personal life the most important decision you may make you'll make is is the spouse that most of you will likely have and it's very important to surround your people yourself with people or the better than you are you are going to move in the direction of the people you associate with so i i've been enormously lucky in that respect i mean i've i've just had teachers and and friends and a spouse that really was a better person i was and i had enough sense to learn from these people that that life went better if you behave better yourself and uh it took a while the uh so i i advise you to seek out as your partner in business your partner in life whatever it may be look for the people that actually are examples to you rather than somebody that you need you think you need to straighten out yourself and simple rules like that delighting customers working through other people associating with people that will will cause you to move in a better path than you might otherwise have they will take you so far in life that uh it it's hard to believe

signs crossing guards or traffic lights [Music] I don't really like dwelling on negativity but I just wanted to make a video for any future or current content creators or people that are looking to get into um content creation whether that's on YouTube or Instagram Tick Tock wherever um so there's one thing on going on especially in the YouTube space where I think in the future YouTube is going to demonetize people or just straight up delete their channels and they're gonna probably be other consequences Associated so what I'm referring to is hit pieces right where you have content creators that are just online just talking about people negatively talking trash about people talking about people's families things like that so just to give you an example um Tasha K recently uh lost a lawsuit to cardi B we're talking to the hit piece on Cardiff several and cardi Suter and essentially is bankrupting her another example of that is this guy named Spencer Cornelia he made a whole bunch of hit pieces calling people scammers and calling people this well one of the guys he made a video about is really about that legal action and has him uh you know in a headlock pretty much in court right now and Spencer has put off a video talking about that you know this whole thing has messed up his life yeah it was all fun and games when he was talking trash about people but now your YouTube channel isn't making as much money as it was because it was all it was just all hit pieces and this guy is suing you and he's created a GoFundMe page to ask the people that were watching his channel and enjoying these hit pieces to pretty much contribute money to help him get out of this legal trouble um that's just one example now there's the other side of the coin that comes with content creation and what I told people in the past is the internet and the streets are in intersection that doesn't have stop signs crossing guards or traffic lights okay so you have a lot of these content creators that are just their channel is built on just talking trash about people but what a lot of people understand you know some of these content creators and I've seen like for example like him 500 said you know you guys are content creators nobody's a warrior but it's not about that it's about the people around them their friends their family and the people that follow them that you know are running up and down these intersections and I foresee some of these people crashing out right and then YouTube is going to implement policies where they'll demonetize your Channel or they'll delete your channel if you're making hit pieces now when I say crash out what am I talking about I'm talking about things particularly spilling over into the streets now we've seen this happen with some content creators um and people really don't understand how simple or how easy it is you know especially if you're a content creator for people to spot you publicly right so just to give you an example um there was a guy like probably two years ago at this point was he's making videos about me like negative videos which I didn't really care you know you need haters in some capacity well one of the homies happened to call me one afternoon and was like Hey you remember that dude or you know that dude on YouTube that's talking about you well he right here right so just knowing right I didn't physically see him he didn't physically see me but somebody that knew me saw me he had no idea like my one of my homies is at his job right he's like yeah you know uh like let me know I could have snapped my fingers and it could have the trajectory of his life could have changed at that instance without him even knowing but I told the Homer I said nah man you know I'm not worried about that like don't like leave him alone so what ended up happening was my my homie you know pretty much told him like hey you know you're doing all this doing all that like this is how easy it is for me to for you to be touched right and he's and he he stopped making content about me after that right but from my understanding um from what I saw he was putting out content but still putting out content about other people and somebody else ended up dealing with him like he got dealt with and that channel is no longer there and he's no longer doing what he was doing so in theory what I'm trying to say is is that you know people think that a lot of these guys are just content creators and they're just talking trash about them calling them scammers and saying this isn't that well that's not always the point of view from the people that like them from the people that are related to them from to their friends and you know and you could wind up in situations whether you're getting sued or whether you know somebody sees you and it's on site and you got a problem you're out with your your family you got your kids with you and you know some of these people just don't care right so I'm saying all that to say like stay away from that style content if you want to get into the content creation space do something positive um you don't have to talk about people to to to make money on YouTube now there is a lot of money in talking about people especially when it's something that's trending you know but like I said it has its pros and its cons and that is one of the cons like um so for example like Tony the closer right Tony the closer is aware he said out his mouth and wrote it in the post like the things that I'm doing I can get killed out here for saying what I'm saying and doing what I'm doing I'm aware but I'm trying to spread awareness some of these guys are green they're out here doing these hit pieces on people and they're just straight up green like me personally if I can't bring the fire I'm not going to that particular State like for example California right I'm not gonna I'm not going to go to California I'm not going to go to New York because I can't carry a firearm now I don't make hit pieces about people and I still move like Rambo you have some of these people out here um that make hit pieces on people and they just out here just just just rolling around just you know like everything's all good but it's not I'll give you an example and I'll say names because I don't care um you had the the the whole thing with eyl and then you had this other guy uh pocket watching whatever his name is running to them in California you're out with your wife now you got a group of guys roll up on you now luckily nothing physical happened it could have turned physical right but I know California gun laws a homie not from California you know what I mean he could have got dealt with and you out here holding hands with your wife thinking everything cool you just walking around thinking you know life is great and somebody could have dealt with both of y'all right that fast all because being on it now whether he's right or wrong about the people that he's talking about it doesn't matter he could he could be right about everything but the simple fact that you're putting these guys on blast and talking negatively about these people is what can get your life cut short when it comes to a lot of this stuff you know what I'm saying it didn't even have to be an eyo it could have been one of the homies it could have been somebody that likes them or say oh ain't that that dude right there you know what I mean your next door neighbor could be on the team and can back door you because and let me explain back door that means set you up you know they your neighbor can see what you're doing and be like man I actually like eyel or let's let's make an example out of this guy or you know I like this particular person or I know the particular person that he's doing hit pieces on well let me make an example out of this guy you see what I'm saying and a lot of people don't think don't think that way because they not they may not have been a part of or from That Walk of Life but that doesn't mean that these people aren't right and like some of these hit pieces that I'm seeing on internet like some of these guys just came home for attempted murder home invasions murders and you're making hit pieces on these people these are the people you want to smoke with for real um and this part of the reason why I changed uh the name of this channel you know it's not just all things real estate it's all things in real life like I'm talking about real life stuff this is these are things that can help you avoid situations and that can save your life right now if you are somebody that wants to get out here and you want to make hit pieces about people you know have a great legal team and you better be out here moving like Rambo you know even if you got like like I remember um uh what's his name Ryan Pineda was saying that um you know he had to hire security because people you know be talking trash about them and it's not in the third even with security like they want to make a home to their families and like if you get in the shootout with security they're going to protect themselves they're not gonna protect you so you should be carrying the fire too and I'm just being honest about the reality of content creation right you know uh actors actresses rappers singers they all have security for a reason right you know we saw how people breaking the Chris Brown's house all people breaking the Rihanna's house because you know because they're crazed or they're obsessed or they don't like them or whatever the case is well it's no difference in content creation it can get very dangerous legally and on the streets like I said the internet has become the streets it is a it is an intersection okay that doesn't have a stop sign there's no crossing guard and there are no traffic lights you know you have a lot of people to just speeding through these intersections and at the end of the day a lot of y'all are going to end up crashing out and that's just real [Music]

Most Financial Advisors Know Nothing About Investing,"Warren Buffett has often advised people to steer clear of financial advisors, and in this video he explains why their poor advice can be so harmful to investing performance.",756.0,72118,106,it's it's it's amazing how hard people make what a simple game as it is but of course if if they told everybody what a simple game it was then you know 90 of the income or more of the people that are speaking uh would disappear so it's really a little too much of us to expect of human nature that people will explain why they really aren't adding any value to what you can do by yourself or actually you're you know I hate to use the example but you can't have monkeys throwing throwing darts at the at the page and you know take away the management fees and everything I'll I'll I'll bet on the monkeys but it's not it I don't consider them a superior species and I don't want them to move next door instead of my next door neighbor or anything but that is the way it's just the way it has to be ain't careful to say well frequently and well the wealth advisory business the way it used to be you you go to your investment advisor and you say what should I do to protect myself for the future and he says why don't you give me fifty thousand dollars in your net worth now that's my contribution to your future It's A peculiar business yeah it's a great place to go Rich it's still if you have if you're if you have a uh I saw her daughter that that really wants to make money per point of IQ and per ERG of energy and all of that um go to Wall Street I mean don't have manner to the priesthood or anything I mean if that's what they itself selects and uh it always will be the case I mean there's no reason to spare about Humanity because they behave in their self-interest they may not actually be behaving in their self-interest over time but they uh uh you know are they happier who the hell knows but but if they just want to make money but uh well people here in the auditorium saw a little session from the Solomon uh Solomon uh episode and Jerry Corrigan was then the head of the New York fed and that same committee was grilling him and they said they were giving him a hard time and they said uh who was the highest they said something to this effect who was the highest paid or uh guy at Solomon last year and then I said well he uh yeah and he named him and he said maybe he named him and and you said he got I forget what it was 20 million last year and we're talking 1991 now too he said they got 20 million and uh the guy says well how old is he and he said well I think he's Corrigan's and somebody affected he's um you know 26 or something like that and then Corrigan couldn't resist saying and he can't even throw a football and the truth was you know now there's a lot more money in throwing a football now than there used to be but uh you know one of my heroes was Ted Williamson you know I think he was making 20 or 25 000 a year and uh it'll just imagine that they some guy the best 230 or 240 you know and he makes it to the banks I mean he's the money flows in and of course ah those peoples should sit down and think the fact that the the stadium that could hold 30 or 40 000 people and was the source of revenue for the people who paid their paychecks and that Stadium went from 30 to 40 000 because somebody first invented television and they came up with cable television and they came up with pay and all that sort of thing and no nobody knows the names of those people but capitalism is very very very peculiar in how it dishes out rewards and for a while it was better to be in Wall Street than Vietnam 220 or 230 hit Aaron in the in the bags and uh uh and you know it is now reverse because uh of the development of TV Etc so it's a crazy world rewards seem very very very very very capricious and they are and they don't seem ing Theologian or or even to Charlie and me in our spare time and the whole thing seems kind of crazy uh but it's worked awfully well and even the people who don't take advantage get short Change by the system are doing far far better than if the system hadn't gotten changed doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that you necessarily shouldn't work for change but you should recognize the limitations of what you can do with humans I'll put it that way okay Charlie is there any way you'd like to close the sermon well I do think we have a very interesting phenomenon in I would argue that a lot of the wealth advisory business people are charging for skill and delivering closet index as a closet indexisation in other words you nobody can stand being that different from the crowded and results they're afraid they'll lose their fees so everybody does the same thing it's it's mildly ridiculous the world is mildly ridiculous as Charlie pointed out in the movie with you before we were married you know we tried to convince uh a couple young women that we were really more attractive than we were I mean you can't expect people not to behave with their self-injured and that was very important that that uh that uh we didn't dispose all disclose all of our weaknesses before the marriage so when we're trying to be a little better and I don't know about you but I've slightly improved since I was 17. well well that's that's a really interesting point because if if fortuners just showered you with all kinds of good things you ought to be a better person in the second half of your life than the first half I mean that is really should not be asking too much of people if they've if they've won the ovarian Lottery and all kinds you know they're born in the United States and all kinds of good things have happened to them uh and you've had a chance to see how stupid you were and all kinds of things you did you know why not have the second half of your life be better than the first half I mean and I would say working from a very low base but I mean I I'm not nearly you know by any intelligence test or ability to do any of that you know I haven't learned anything but you do learn certain things only by interacting with people and you don't know when you're two years old no matter how much you're picking up all kinds of of Knowledge from the world the learning machine that's going on in a two-year-old's head is just unbelievable but it's not the same as having 30 or 40 years of experience with actually how the human animal behaves which is that you really you know you're learning all the time about it but that should make you a better person in the second half of your life in the first time and I would say that if you say you're a better person in the second half I've got reason to say it in the first half you know forget about the first half enjoy the second half and uh uh and they both Charlie and I've had the luxury of well they ain't living a long time so we get to play what we would regard as the the hopeful and respectable second half ah and we have had enough sense to figure out well we figured out what makes us happy and we've gotten somewhat more sensitive to make other people unhappy and all that sort of thing and and I'd rather be judged by the second half of my life than the first half and so would Charlie yeah of course okay I'm very I I don't even look at what I did when I was young because it would

worry too much about whether somebody says this is going to be a year of low prices because exports are being affected or anything like that you know you buy a farm and you'll hold it for I've got one farm that I bought the 1980s and my son runs it but I've been there once you know I mean it it it doesn't grow faster if I go and stare at it you know I can't cheer for it you know more effort more effort or something like that and I know there's going to be some years when prices are going to be good and so when the prices aren't going to be good I know there's years but yields will be better than others what about the farm I don't care about economic predictions on or anything of the sort I do care that over over the years it's well tended to in terms of rotating crops and I hope yields get better which they generally have in fact that farm 100 years ago would have probably produced 30 bushels maybe 35 bushels of corn per acre now in a good year you know it'd be 200 I mean we've really made progress in this country that's one reason commodity prices have go back a couple hundred years they've moved so little is because we've just gotten better and better at whether it's cotton or whether it's it's Corners soybeans are all kinds of things that and you and I have benefited from that well it's it's a it's a long-term investment and if you owned if you own the best auto dealership in town uh the best brand and had something good running it wouldn't drop by every day and say you know how many people have come in today or you know I think interest rates are going up a little maybe it'll slow down our sales or anything no you'll buy it knowing there's 365 days a year and you're going to own it for 20 years so that's 7 300 days and you know they're gonna if things are going to be different from day to day and year to year you shouldn't buy it up the day-to-day stuff that's important cash is always a bad investment I mean but when people said cash is King a year ago I mean that's crazy I mean cash wasn't producing anything and it was sure to go down in value over time we will always have enough cash around but anytime we have Surplus cash around I'm unhappy I mean I would much rather have good businesses than cash and and we found a chance in the last year they're about to deploy we came in with something over 40 billion in cash we've got about 20 billion now and we've had some earnings so we we put a lot of cash to work and I like that no I much rather own a good business uh than have cash big opportunities in life have to be seized now we don't do very many things but when we get the chance to do something that's right and big we've got to do it and even to do it in a small scale is just as big a mistake almost as not doing it at all I mean you've really gotta you gotta grab them when they come and because they you're not going to get 500 great opportunities you would be better off if when you got out of school here you got a punch card with 20 punches on it and every big Financial every financial decision you made you used up a punch you get very rich because you'd think through very hard each one I mean he went to a cocktail party and somebody talked about a company he didn't even understand what they did or couldn't pronounce the name but they made some money last week and another one like it you wouldn't buy it if you only had 20 punches on that card there's a temptation to dabble if uh particularly during bull markets uh uh in stocks it's so easy you know it's easier now than ever because you can do it online you know just you click it in and maybe it goes up a point and get excited about that and you buy another one the next day and so you can't make any money over time doing that but if you had a punch card with only 20 bunches you weren't going to get another one the rest of your life you would think a long time before every investment decision and you would make good ones and you'd make big ones and you probably wouldn't even use all 20 punches in your lifetime but you wouldn't need to I think the Earned Income Tax Credit is the best way to put money in the pockets of people that don't fit well into the market system but that are perfectly decent citizens and that have made a good bit of the success something like iPad with Berkshire or something possible it wouldn't have happened without the America we have and if you go back go back 200 years and we're all working on 80 percent of us are working on farms the person that's the best at that working on that farm whatever it may be uh is worth Maybe twice the ones that's the worst you know I mean that's the difference between super talent and no talent in the farm economy picking cotton or whatever it may be now if you're the best middleweight fighter in the world you know you may get 20 or 30 million dollars and and if you are just a good citizen raise nice kids help in the neighborhood and everything else but you don't have Market related skills you'd be you'd be good on that farm still and you would be earning something comparable to most of the people around you but you don't have something now that as it gets more and more specialized and it's going to continue to get more specialized the best boat you can have is your own Talent you know I mean it's they can't they can't take it away from you they inflation can't take it from you taxes can't take it from you so I I when I talk to students I see these students and I tell them you know you're a million dollar asset I would pay you a hundred thousand dollars the mbas for 10 of the earnings for the rest of your life so that makes you a million dollar asset now if you can do something and increase that value 50 if you can learn to communicate better verbally or in written form and you become 50 worth that's 500 000 just by improving yourself I mean it's not nobody can take that away from you and and so I urge everybody you know develop develop the habits you've got the grain power you've got the energy but develop the habits of success and and look around you at the people that you admire you know and list what makes you admire them compared to somebody else that looks equally strong or equally talented and those are those are things that you can do I mean just write them down and and you know people like people that are they like them if they're admit they're humorous and they're friendly if they're if they're uh if they give credit to the other fellow I mean uh and and they don't like them if they're stingy you know or they overstate no we're promised and all those sort of things well that's decision that's a decision you make so so I I encourage everybody to build your own mode around yourself the very best businesses are the ones that earn a high rate of return on tangible assets and and grow but uh uh even ones that don't grow uh if they're in a high return on tangible assets and then of course if you don't pay too much uh uh they can be a good investment they're a good business to start with by the high returns if you pay too much for them you can turn a a good business into a bad investment but if you pay an appropriate price uh you can uh you can do all right now the the big mistake which we made in the early years was to try and buy a bad business at a really cheap price and uh it took me about 20 or 30 years to figure out that wasn't a good idea but this is at the car business the car dealership business it run well uh can be a very good business you you have no receivables to speak of uh your floor plan your inventory you can you can lease your uh real estate we don't do that well only 95 of our real estate so you can have very little Capital actually invested in the business and you do a you do a large volume uh van tile which we bought uh has 78 dealerships uh they'll average over 100 100 million dollars in dealership so you can work on fairly narrow margins and still earn a high return on Capital if you don't have much Capital into 100 business foreign

investors have dialed down their expectations for an aggressively hawkish fed while pricing at a much softer Landing whether or not that materializes is debatable but what's the bottom line for investors how do they navigate a market environment where the FED is in a wait and see mode Yahoo finance says Jared blickery is here to break all of that down for us hey Jared hey there Rochelle first we can take a look at the NASDAQ 100 year-to-day performance and we got some oohs and odds here Nvidia meta have doubled we know this but uh you were just saying we have to go back to the last fed meeting something really important happened at the beginning of the month and at that time or just before the meeting investors were expecting a hard Landing they were pricing in a recession four and a half cuts by the end of this year after the last meeting that number Rose to only two and a half so investors are thinking all right soft Landing now and we've seen gross stocks and especially the the mega caps just take off now this is a 10-year t-note yield this is the beginning of May that's when we had that fed meeting and we were right down testing these lows right by about 3.2 3.3 percent since then we have actually risen and let me just show you the implications this is having on the stock market now this is the NASDAQ 100 versus the NASDAQ Composite going back about 30 40 years this is the.com bubble and crash and we can see huge out performance here and that would be by the mega caps at the time guess who they were Intel you look at Oracle Cisco even Yahoo so at the time we did see a lot more out performance than we are right now here's what's happening this year that little blip light there is the huge out performance we're seeing this year with respect to the mega caps so just want to point out that we can see a lot of more out performance potentially if we were to enter into some kind of bubble mode is it AI I don't know that's just spec regulation but let me show you the investment implications the last time we had a major and this is during the global financial crisis the last time we had a major pause that would be in I believe June of 2006 the FED kicked off a pausing that would last until September that's when they cut and guess what that was a really good time to be in the market when the Fed was on pause and investors just waiting for that first cut here's what happened over uh that roughly 14-month span and these are all the markets I'm looking at at the top here this is Emerging Markets you might say well why would Emerging Markets be the number one outperformer well it has to do with relief because the FED had been raising rates and it was attracting Capital into the United States and all those investors wanted to benefit from those High rates so when the FED paused guess what Emerging Markets well it's their day to shine so we saw Emerging Markets up 52 percent after that energy was up about 34 really interesting because if you're practicing tracking the price of crude oil as we're doing through Uso you can see that Uso was rather depressed but in fact not only energy but all 11 sectors in the S P 500 did very very well here's tech tech was up about 29 over that 14-month period here is gold gold up about 20 percent spy that's the S P 500 The Benchmark up just short of 20 and then Euro I use the euro here as a proxy for the US dollar that means because the Euro was net up we saw a little bit of weakness there and I did want to find uh point out finally that yeah Global financial crisis guess what financials were under a lot of pressure even those were up just slightly by the end but a clear clear bifurcation of the returns and so if we dial it back to the present time what's going on here is quite a bit different and I would say the debt ceiling just another Kink you know to add to the rest of it how is it going to play out in the end we don't know but I just want to finish with this the debt ceiling has actually added liquidity to the con to the economy and when the excuse me when the debt ceiling is eventually resolved which it will be disorderly or not guess what we're going to see the treasury issue massive amounts of bills again to catch up and that's going to drain money from the economy so that liquidity is going to evaporate but the bottom line is when the FED pauses and we don't know if it's pausing just yet we don't have confirmation it's actually a pretty good time to be in the market Rochelle you just got to be in the right markets of course and there you go we'll look with that fantastic breakdown though people can't say that they didn't have an opportunity to learn great stuff Jared blickery there for us thank you so much

the man the myth the legend he ran the Magellan fund at Fidelity between 1977 and 1990 where he achieved a 29.2 percent annual return the guy is an investing Master he also wrote the book one up on Wall Street which you know at this point is basically required reading for all value investors and on top of that it's also one of the best-selling stock market books of all time now Lynch doesn't really do many interviews but I was watching through a lot of his old commentary recently looking for insights that specifically apply to the market conditions that we see today heading into 2023 and it's really surprised at how much stuff I actually found that was useful for right now so as we know our main issue is running into 2023 are high inflation and Rising interest rates which is causing asset prices like stocks and real estate to suffer and it looks like they're going to be the big issues throughout 2023 as well so with that in mind let's firstly hear Peter Lynch's opinion about investing during times where inflation is up and interest rates are rising and what he says might just surprise you in how perfectly relevant it is for today's environment people understand there's a hundred percent correlation with what happens to a company's earnings over several years and what happens to the stock if the company McDonald's has done very well as a company right the stock has done very well people worry about too much money supply what's happened the price of oil whether who's the president who's being nominated for the Supreme Court the ozone layer it has nothing to do McDonald's earnings go up the next 10 years the stock will go but what they will say to you Peter is that as you know and why am I telling you this but anyway it's fun to tell you this they're telling you that these other things influence the amount of earnings of a particular company if we're in a recession people are not going to spend as much money on going to the movies or whatever they do right and and therefore you got to pay attention to these other things because they impact on Earth they are very important but you have no idea of knowing what they're going to do Alan Greenspan's the head of the Federal Reserve right he cannot predict interest rates yes he'd be the first he can influence somebody can't predict them he cannot predict what long-term insurance rates are going to be one year for now two years for now three years he's even surprised how low they are now so how am I supposed to predict interest rates how am I supposed to predict the economy you certainly remember the recession of 82 yes 1982 we had a 20 prime rate 14 unemployment 12 inflation I don't remember anybody telling me in 1980 or 81 that was going to happen all of a sudden we had the worst recession since the depression I didn't read about it in the paper so it's crazy to think about these things you know his overarching point is that yes the macro is important yes it influences prices but as an investor it's one of those things that is short-term and you can't control it so if you can't predict it and you can't control it then why should you spend your time thinking about it and this is a trap that many investors have made this year and it's honestly it's fair because it's all that the media has been talking about you know the FED has had another meeting and they've raised rates the Bureau of Labor Statistics was released this month's CPI data blah blah but you can't get caught up in that sort of stuff as an investor you need to be laser focused on each potential investment you're looking to make and judge each opportunity on its own stocks are not lottery tickets there's a company behind every stock if a company does well the stock does well it's not that complicated people get too carried away and first of all they try and predict the stock market that is a total waste of time no one can predict the stock market they try to predict interest rates if any interest rates right three times in a row they'd be a billionaire it's certainly there's not that many billionaires on the planet they can't be that many people who can pick interest rates because there'd be lots of billionaires and no one can predict the economy I had a lot of people in this room were around in 1981 and 82. when we had a 20 prime rate with double-digit inflation double-digit digit unemployment I don't remember anybody telling me in 1981 about it I didn't read I studied all this stuff I remember anytime we had the worst recession since the depression what I'm trying to tell you it'd be very useful to know what the stock market is going to do it'd be terrific to know that the Dow Jones average year for now would be X that we're gonna have a full-scale recession where interest rates going to be 12 that's useful stuff you never know it though you just don't get to learn it so I've always said if you spend 14 minutes a year in economics you've wasted 12 minutes and I I really believe that as a classic line by Peter Lynch but it really hammers home the idea that while macroeconomics kind of makes the world go around it's really not what we as long-term value investors should be focused on for example 2007 was the last time interest rates were higher than they are now but imagine not buying a business like Amazon or Apple or Google just because you were scared of interest rates it's obviously a bad call in hindsight but even today with the market down there'll still be tons of investors bailing on their portfolios based on a fear that interest rates could go a lot higher and stocks may suffer as Peter Lynch says what we really need to be doing is focusing on the earnings of each individual company you know how profitable are they are they getting more profitable how much cash could they return to shareholders each year is that growing these are the questions to ask and one resource that can definitely help you in that space is simply Wall Street for the sponsor of today's video so I currently use the simply Wall Street unlimited plan for research searching my videos and with that I get unlimited access to global markets so you can

focusing on the macro fair enough but what should we do now that the market is down 15 is it a time to wait and see or is it a time to buy at a discount well we had a huge run I mean the market was 4 000 just you know two and a half years ago yeah and it Round Up to 8 300 in August and you know like any big rally sometimes it backs off and it's healthy in fact I mean I'd rather gone down a thousand points than gone to twelve thousand if you look at Japan Japan went from five thousand to fifteen thousand on their Dow it was fairly priced at fifteen thousand on earnings and everything else then it went to forty thousand and that caused seven years of inflated real estate people overspending and basically they've been a recession for five or six years because their Market went up too high the market was too high you're discounting earnings seven eight ten years out isn't that the story the past few years interest rates were at zero and the market just absolutely ripped but now we're seeing the opposite interest rates are up and the stock market is down but Lynch's key Point here is that you shouldn't be concerned about this he even says you know it's healthy because when the market is hot and you do your discounted cash flow analyzes usually the conclusion you come to is that the stock has to execute perfectly over the next five years to actually justify its current valuation but on the other hand when the market drops things start to swing in the long-term value investors favor and that's really what you need to remember when the market goes down we need to stay focused on the long term I may have been right six times out of ten but if I'm right I make a double or triple occasionally it offsets the times you lose 30 or 40 percent in fact you could be right a third of the time as long as you have a lot of good results so when you're short you can only make 90 when you're long you make tenfold or five-fold so I think long is the way to be corporate products have grown about seven or eight percent a year that means they double but including dividends about every 10 years could Drupal every 20 go up Eightfold every 40. that's the kind of numbers you're interested then a 10-year bond today is a little over two percent so I think the stock market's the best place to be for the next 10 20 30 years the next two years no I've never known what the next two years is going to bring and that's a very good point you know in the next two years nobody knows nobody I really wish I could get that point across to more people you know in the next two years the stock market could go up or it could go down and there's no way to know which way it's headed but over 10 20 30 years the likely outcome becomes much clearer businesses get more productive they earn more or they increase their valuations and stock prices go up we can take a coin out and flip it I have no idea what the next thousand point is going to do the next 6 000 points is going to be up the next 14 000 points can be up the next 20 000 points can be up but you don't know where the next thousand is going to be up nobody does and it's futile to try and guess it corporate profits will be a lot higher 10 years from now it'll be a lot higher 20 years from now that's what you could rely on Microsoft didn't exist 20 years ago Staples didn't exist 20 years Federal Express didn't exist 20 years ago new companies will come along 20 years ago that's what makes Amgen has two one billion dollar drugs they didn't exist 20 years ago new companies that come along that's what makes this country work so that's the game stay focused on the long term and watch for those companies that pop up on your radar that look really solid the ones that you understand the ones that have a competitive Advantage the ones that have really well-oiled management teams and then lastly and most importantly the ones that offer a steep discount to intrinsic value and this has been the problem over the past few years unfortunately there have been many wonderful businesses out there but basically all of them have been at really high prices so much so that they really did need to execute perfectly over the next 10 years for their valuation to be justified this is Peter Lynch talking to exactly that scenario you say to yourself I think this company is going to earn something in the future if it's already discounting that if it's selling at a huge multiple you see it's already it has to work and then it's only going to stay even so you have to see yourself if I'm right how much am I going to make if I'm wrong how much I'm going to lose that's the risk reward ratio in stockshot we talk about if I'm right I hope I'm going to double trip my money if I'm wrong maybe I'll lose 30 40 that's a favor ratio if you say if I'm right the Stock's not gonna go up it's already discounting terrific things if discounting terrific things are already in the stock I don't know okay that's really going to be the secret to investing well in 2023 watching these valuations you know what we're looking for are companies that are wonderful but also valued low enough that the risk reward is in our favor for example if you calculate that a stock is going to grow at you know 15 per year for the next 10 years and if that happens you think right now the shares are worth 50 bucks well if the stock sits at 50 then that's an annoying spot to be in if you buy the shares the company has to execute perfectly to make you a return what we're looking for are the stocks that you've calculated to be worth fifty dollars today that are actually selling for 25. that's what Peter Lynch was saying and for those wondering how you do that well I'll actually leave a link on the screen right now to an in-depth video on calculating intrinsic value I would go over it here but it's a very long topic so please check out that video if you actually wanted to learn that process but long story short we're finding wonderful companies that are valued well below intrinsic value and that's when we seize the opportunity of this Market weakness all these public companies out there here's the company I really like the fundamentals are terrific their earnings are doing well the competitors are doing poorly I think this company's doing terrific and all of a sudden the stock might have gone from 40 to 30 because of this decline that would say wow here's a chance to buy it so you're trying to see some companies might have been overpriced at 60 and all they did was go to 50 and say big deal so you're trying to find companies you liked anyway right now you liked them and now they've had a haircut that's what you would do not it's like the one from overpriced to fairly Place sometimes fairly place at the start of this exercise and then had a very you know five for four sale so that is it guys we're looking for companies on sale ones that you know were fairly priced and have now dropped into margin of safety territory thanks to the movement of the broader Market the one thing we don't do is get too deep in the weeds of macro economics and end up being spooked out of our tried and true long-term value investing strategies anyway guys that will just about do us for today thanks very much for watching the video of course leave a like on the video if you did enjoy it and subscribe to

Follow me on Instagram: @jasper.kov",525.0,11693,89,I'm all for stirring up the scene a bit welcome to the kov video and I'm happy to present you these controversial topics more specifically boxing papers Investments and unpolished now if you don't agree they might be in popular opinions I'm happy to hear why not before you hear all the facts and we're going to do so in my favorite strip joint clip Bunton oh [Music] starting off with something that actually has little to do with watches itself box and papers and people are usually surprised to hear luckily not as our response to their question if those are included with a watch we offer allow me to elaborate I would like to start with an important reservation I'm not saying you shouldn't buy a watch if it does come with the aforementioned additional accessories but I am saying that you should not let a deal depend on it let me take it one step further I'd rather buy a watch without since it most likely have to pay less or I can use that budget on better condition or more interesting configuration after all I'm passionate about the actual watch not about some paper and a cardboard box it is up to you to decide to what extent you think I'm right but let's get the facts out there now I also understand that it can feel sketchy if a modern timepiece doesn't come as a full set by now most consumers in the luxury Market keep everything surrounding the object itself I wouldn't not buy a modern watch of everything else checked out but for some it might raise doubts however the habit of holding onto box and papers wasn't common at all until quite recently after all most people don't keep that stuff when they buy a vacuum cleaner for instance and same goes for warranty papers most threw it out after it expires since it didn't serve purpose anymore moreover manufacturers did an intent for boxes to be kept for many years they were merely used as packaging material usually made of cheap and perishable materials like cardboard pleather and plywood just have a look at your average Patek Omega hours Ultra box from the previous Century you can almost see them disintegrate before your very eyes it is uncommon for someone to have kept the original boxing papers for decades and as per usual in the World of Watches if something is rare becomes desirable and that's valuable occasionally boxing papers can command premiums up to 25 percent most notably regarding vintage Rolex watches so are you being swindled if you decide to pay up firstly that's the bunker common misconception boxes nor papers guarantee originality they don't tell you whether a watch is in an altered condition or even genuine at all you could have a Rolex where the cereal matches the original papers but with all components of the watch being changed the dial could be a service placement it could be refinished or even completely aftermarket or Worse the serial number from the original papers could be re-engraved into any watch genuine or fake if the papers are indeed original in the first place well Swiss Precision is often copied but never duplicated the same can't be said of warranty papers or cards banknotes are created with all kinds of anti-counterfeiting features but there are still organizations out there that can fake them so well that most wouldn't be able to tell now imagine the money that can be made by counterfeiting a warranty paper that was never made in a way that would prevent people from Faking it I've held an original Rolex warranty certificate in my left and a fake one in my right hand and even I had difficulty separating them despite years of experience the fake paper even smelled vintage because they were kept in an old Book for a couple of months besides fake papers there are also many original papers that were just never filled out you can buy them by the Dozen at any watch fair or even online it'll cost you a couple of hundreds but can add thousands in value doesn't that sound ridiculous and before you start about the so-called punch papers from Rolex vintage punch machines have notoriously been sold online alongside dealer stamps which two are being duplicated in other words it's not that difficult to produce 100 correct papers and nobody will be able to prove they're not original just add a period correct box some booklets that you bought of eBay and voila you've successfully added some serious value to the watch after extensive research it's safe to assume at least half of the Rolex watches with paper produced prior to 1990 are currently supplied without the certificate they were actually born with therefore if anything regarding confidence being offered a vintage Rolex with papers makes me more suspicious some brands also offer extract services or even reports of authenticity this alongside service papers may be considered next up I would like to tackle the argument that a full set is a better investment the value in the secondary Market is a result of supply and demand whilst the supply of vintage watches with warranties magically increases the demand diminishes because people start to realize the scam resulting in a declining premium at best another often made excuse of limiting purchases to full sets is that it would be easier to sell after this plea you might consider that as arguable I'm also denying the claim of some the true collectors to see complete specimen hence the term collector set but all the aficionados we know and we know a fair share wouldn't ever pass on a deal for a rare and sought after watch due to the absence of these relevant things I get that boxing papers can add a feeling of authenticity and romance to your watch and sometimes it may indeed indicate that the previous owner took great care of his price possession and surely you should pay whatever you think something is worth in some cases I too would pay a couple thousands extra I like the colored accessories coming with the beach Daytona said the quirky two-door peanut box or the Omega crater box for example some cool provenance of the previous owners appreciated too but especially with vintage Rolex the premiums are Justified for all the wrong reasons and simply too high do as you please but let this serve as a caution and remember you can't wear a box and or papers over to our next subject Investments and regardless of what you've read or heard generally speaking wristwatches are a terrible performing asset compared to the Dow Jones Metals real estate Etc bear in mind the majority of timepieces plummeted value officer purchase think about that Armani Versace Tommy Hilfiger stuff and not only the cheap watches show tremendous downside on the resale side how about the blow Panerai some highly complicated pieces from Brands like at ABC or the Lion's Share of betual executions with that being said the luxury watch Market in particularly established Brands and more recently Independence potentially have an interesting Roi yet it's easy to discard pieces as a bad investment but nobody can answer you what's the best investment any dealer claiming this and selling your watch as such is full of  and should be avoided at all times even if one would be able to answer that question why would he be selling it then now the interesting question arises should you speculate with watches I would always prioritize an investment in your enjoyment rather than financial gain I think it's great many of us can enjoy such wonderful products often without losing money and occasionally even making a good Buck on it preferably to using your next purchase but it feels a bit poor to ultimately let that be the decisive Factor it strikes me as odd to think about the resale during your buying process of such an emotional purchase so do we as professional Watch dealers never buy watches as an investment trading watches is capital intensive so for us cash flow is King from time to time we purchase sleepers what we believe the market isn't aware of its importance yet and therefore is undervalued a lot of factors come into play to predict if and by what extent the market will pick this up but throughout our following we can create more appreciation and make Market in an ethical Way by advertising it as a so-called value buy rather than just following the market or even worse manipulating Market it isn't hard to manipulate the market with the right Capital connections you can exercise a lot of influence on the price but a good old cartel model adding insult to injury most unexperienced relying Chrono 24 for the current market price failing to realize the difference with the actual going rate of a model which in some cases is far apart this isn't some far-fetched conspiracy theory it happened rather recently with contemporary hype models the bull market wasn't fueled by Passion but merely driven by potential profits with the dealer friends in the mix so if you do want to get into it you have to realize the risks I'm no Financial advisor but happy to tell you about the pros and cons compared to traditional Investments let's start with the positive aspects first and foremost a watch is something you can enjoy physically if you were to invest in alternative assets like wine or whiskey the value it disappears once the bottle is opened watches might also be more accessible and enjoyable to learn about than the stock market and to many it has a more comprehensible intrinsic value lastly it is possibly more Anonymous and less transparent which might be interesting for tax purposes but the lack of transparency can also be a pitfall in the buying and selling process which brings us to the downside of investing in watches this asset class offers lower liquidity and higher costs like maintenance and transaction fees and risks it can get stolen or it can get ripped off if you don't have any knowledge and or trustworthy connections it also demands more Capital to start with a diversified and less volatile portfolio properly investing in watches whilst hatching as much risk as possible requires at least tens of thousands of Euros last but not least is something that is the most dangerous part but simultaneously the most attractive emotion and my heart and my wallet are oftentimes not cohesive my advice would be to buy what you like for the amount of watch it's worth to you then you can never lose  the market enjoy your watch the topic of unpolished is up next one of the most frequently asked questions is if a watch is unpolished in many cases asking this exposes your lack of expertise and experience nothing wrong if that does apply to you but there are many dealers out there trying to take advantage of gullible buyers some of you may be outraged or offended by this but I'm spreading my views for protection purposes winning information prior to your purchase is the right thing to do and by extension asking the seller questions is a method that should be applied sensibly so let me explain why this isn't the right thing to ask when buying a vintage watch many have read somewhere the subject is relevant or even mandatory yet failed to realize that unpolished isn't a condition standard at all if you aim at a New Old Stock example it's wishful thinking for most popular brands tool watches especially disqualifying 99 of them and leaving a few exceptions in a different price bracket regardless a watch can be unpolished but worn out or properly polished but in pristine condition a resume rather the degree and quality of polishing is of importance over polished however is a condition standard and only let Specialists do the job some art designs are so skilled they can make it appear mint even Brands themselves offer laser recharge services like AP Patek some Rolex centers like Bexley and subsequently it sadly is sometimes advertises and Polished by the seller or some auction house it is very hard to determine the difference between truly unpolished and refurbished even if you have cognizance condition is of the utmost importance but I hope you now realize asking if watch is unpolished has little to do with that thanks for listening to my rent I hope I was able to back up My Views that were formed over the past decade in a logical manner you do not have to share my thoughts even more so I invite you to share how our opinions differ but please present a substantiated claim in a professional fashion that way we can all learn from each other [Music]

should go have you been waterproof cold proof where the hell am I and what did I get myself into this time proof if you've been there then you know there's no such thing as solo wherever you've been wherever you go we go every step every wall every time we always have your back I'm gonna get back to that intro video in just a moment this is the stocks with Josh show thanks for hitting the like say hi in the comments I'm going to be covering a big topic today but before I get into that I have to give some fresh technicals on Apple Tesla Baba and Bitcoin they're super hot today there's a link to getting free stock in the top pin comment of this video if you need better trade tools check out the new offer from the MooMoo Investment app in that top pinned comment all right so much opportunity in the market right now it's super exciting I told you guys that when Apple was 172 dollars that the candlesticks were super bullish and that I had no doubt that we were gonna make a move on a new all-time high since then we've pushed up to 180 dollars if we get a daily Candlestick close above 180 then I'm predicting the Apple will hit 189 and it seems like it's gonna happen full disclosure I'm in apple calls and Apple stock so I see support for Apple right now at 177 we're not going to get this close to an all-time high and not make it so maybe a pullback to 177 and then I'm expecting a blast up now you know that I've advised that apple is a sentiment indicator for the markets which simply means to me if apple is bullish it leaves room for the markets to continue to move higher now I also have to talk about Tesla briefly because it's just too hot I told you when it broke above the channel that we were going higher today we're seeing follow through and strength on that move I was asked in the chat group what to expect and I'm going to tell you that I'm very bullish on Tesla right now so take that into consideration 215 is just the beginning Tesla I think is going to hit 227. 200 range has served as a strong resistance for quite a while and moving forward since we've gotten above it I think it's going to become a strong support level I'm not expecting a close back below 200 anytime soon I think we're going to get to 227 beforehand now I'm loaded to the tilt on Tesla calls and stocks so let's see what happens I'll cover my thoughts on Baba in more depth soon but for now I'm in Baba resistance ahead for Baba is just below 87 if we gotta close above 87 that would confirm a much higher move up and if we got to close below 80 again that would confirm a much bigger move down now I've been telling people in the comments that I think Chinese stocks are going to do well in June Bitcoin is in an interesting place it's in a tight price compression range that's building up for a move up I think it's going to remain between 27 and 26 and then I think it's going to break to the upside on its way to 34k and when it gets there if anyone asks me what a good price entry for Bitcoin will be I'm simply going to respond with a mind blown or a meh Emoji you've been put on notice my dear friends alright so today I'm going to tackle an extremely important topic that I've been reluctant to talk about because it's controversial we will be covering vfc stock well we're going to get into the technicals and the opportunity in just a moment but before I begin I want to talk about the North Face jacket that you guys see I'm wearing I've actually had this jacket shirt for over 25 years I got this a long long time ago and if you've known me you've actually seen me wear it this will be the second time I've worn it in a video it's North Face a brand that I've always liked and to whom I've been a loyal customer being a customer for over a decade and if you ask me to describe the brand I would have used words like woodsy rustic more of a simple subdued fashion statement it's the type of clothes you take on a hike but not to a downtown dinner scene matter of fact if you go to the North Face website they describe their brand in this way they say the North Face brand offers unrivaled technologically advanced Outdoor Products designed for everyone from the most accomplished climbers Mountaineers and snow sport athletes and endurance athletes to novice explorers in search of Adventure well I'd fall into the novice Explorer in search of Adventure category that to me is a good description of their brand well let's check out north Face's most recent marketing campaign watch this with me hi it's me Patagonia a real-life homosexual and today I'm here with the North Face we are here to invite you to come out in nature with us wow this is nice we like to call this little tour the summer of Pride this tour has everything hiking community art lesbians lesbians making art last year we gave saw shade Across the Nation and celebrated Pride Across the Nation with hundreds of you across the nation this year we're back back again with two new stops Atlanta GA why because you're there in Salt Lake City we're coming for you of course this year all these fabulous speakers will be coming from inside this TV to a nature near you so come outside and celebrate the beautiful LG HGTV community [Music] that's pretty gay wow now when I first saw this clip circulating on Twitter I genuinely thought it was an over-the-top SNL satire skit on the Modern Advertising movement but as it slowly continued and it ended with the North Face logo my heart actually sank I thought oh my goodness what's going to happen with my vfc investment as well as just being disappointed to see North Face a trusted brand Veer so far away from their core customer there is nothing that he is wearing in the ad that I know to be North Face or that aligns with their defined marketing since the brand was established in 1966 this brand was established by a couple hiking enthusiasts who were committed to exploring and conserving the natural wild lands now I've been in marketing for a long time longer than I've been trading and what I can tell you is a brand is very personal a brand consists of curated ideas images colors and feelings so how did the intro video a well-defined brand turn into that video you well it's being done by the IMF international monetary fund this is an organization that is outside of the U.S that has used the three largest investment organizations in the world BlackRock Vanguard and State Street as well as large American Banks and International Banks to enforce popular American companies and Brands to bend to their corporate social credit system that they call corporate equality index they want to impose their values on the entire world on the surface anything with the word equality in it sounds good right but that's not really their agenda it's Conformity that they're looking for if a company does not align themselves with this social agenda that company will be cut off from critical lines of credit that they need to maintain or grow their business these brands do not want to do this to their brands it's being done under the threat of financial life or death and here's the bigger concern if they can get major American corporations to comply to the this social credit agenda who's going to be next the expression of individualism that is the foundation of American culture has is being threatened to be wiped off the face of the Earth this is absolutely about personal freedom and freedom of speech and the proof is that companies like North Face with a clear and curated brand have gone so far off script something to really understand about American philosophy is that here in the United States corporations are classified as people and money is an expression of one's freedom of speech that's something I want you guys to think about so let's step away from that for a moment I want to talk about the vfc stock vfc stock was in January of 2020 a 100 stock vfc was a dividend-paying blue chip stock beloved by Wall Street the conglomerate of Highly sought after established American brands of which North Face was one the stock has been in free fall for the last couple years despite maintaining good fundamentals and at one point I just attribute that to the fear of the coming recession I viewed it as an overreaction and a sell-off with this coming recession because these were sort of a middle class brand that perhaps could suffer in an environment where people had less cash I saw the drop as an overreaction and as a huge opportunity and I decided I was going to begin to accumulate around the key level of support of 22 dollars which I have been doing now it continued to bleed off and I warned that if it hit twenty dollars and broke below that the stock could fall to 17 which was the next level of support beneath and it did that well on that note if 17 breaks this stock could fall to thirteen dollars which would be the next level of support beneath that now I'm going to continue to accumulate because I believe in the quality of this company and I believe that the stock will likely recover to the Forty to sixty dollar range in the next two years I do believe that all of this all of this turmoil is presenting an opportunity on vfc having said that I now see that the smart money was bailing on this stock not because the fear of recession but because of the risk of brand destruction that they saw coming down the pipeline with this IMF initiative their CEI agenda this really is there really is no way of knowing which brands in America Will Survive and what the backlash of the consumers will be we also don't know how far these corporations will go to align themselves with this agenda we see that it backfired with Bud Light matter of fact the term Bud Light yourself has become equivalent to the idea of committing Financial suicide and what's really interesting is that Bud Light did their Dylan Mulvaney campaign to comply with CEI guidelines and when the board of directors and the CEO saw that they were in financial Free Fall losing 16 billion they quickly backed away from aligning themselves with the failed ad campaign only for their CEI score to be dropped to zero that was a threat to every other corporation that doesn't follow through on compliance to the CEI agenda all right I have to play this clip on this subject that's full of cussing and sexual innuendos I've tried my best to clean it up but you'll get the point this clip does not represent me but I think it represents Bud light's core customer and people that will respond to this type of agenda so go ahead and check it out foreign in the hands of three naked chicks painted in red white and blue offering free booties and ass and I promise you I promise you they're not gonna buy it they're not going to just ain't gonna happen you're You're gone but like see like what I take from that clip is that it is simply a genuine expression of sentiment for everyday people that do not intend to go along with this foreign social Invasion on American products and American brands so this is going to be just as bearish for American brands as AI is bullish for them this battle is going to continue to play out in the days ahead it's really just getting started these are just the beginnings of it right now I'm actually going to continue to buy vfc it's a weekly purchase in my long-term retirement portfolio it's not a swing trade right I'm gonna cut things off on this video right there it's possible that this video can be censored by YouTube and even taken down because this topic is so divisive in our society I'd love to hear your guys's opinion in the comment section as well as what your thoughts are on vfc is it a buy sell or hold for you guys this is not Financial

number two if you don't think you're a good ice skater or if you're convinced you're not a good cellist you're not going to try it but people are buying stocks anyway they're not discouraged they just think it's a gamble yeah we begin with peter lynch time magazine has called him america's number one money manager during the 13 years he headed the fidelity magellan fund it was a top-ranked general equity mutual fund his new book beating the street offers advice on picking stocks and maximizing profits and he's here to talk to us about a lot of things welcome to the broadcast you wrote a book called one up on wall street and i think that's one of the best-selling books ever about wall street if i'm not correct you can correct me so why then did you write another okay okay i think the reason i wrote it is the first i try to explain to people their great advantages their edges they have and that they should get involved in stocks right and they should do it on the right basis on the first book right yeah and obviously i didn't make a great impression because the percent of people's assets involved in stocks has gone down in 1960 people had 40 of their financial assets including their house in stocks and mutual funds in 80 that was down to 25 it's now down to 17 and why do you think that is well i think people in the decade of the 80s was the best decade this century for stocks i think people managed to lose money in the 80s doing it themselves because their methods were so flawed so i i really feel as though i wanted people to understand i don't want anybody to buy a stock i'm saying if you're going to buy a stock you should do certain things right if you're not willing to do these things you should leave your money in the bank your philosophy is simple and i'm remembering this from the previous book i think we're now talking about the previous book correct your philosophy was if you find something that you identify with i remember that was the story of your wife and her hose yeah your wife kept all the legs oh you got it legs and panties your wife said these are the greatest things i've ever seen right and when your wife said that you knew that this was a product that was better right you used to stay at la quinta motel right the service was better whatever was better the price is good and the price was good too and you said this is a place that i can determine i peter lynch can tell that this is a good product right if these people are making a good product then their earnings are going to go up therefore the stock's going to go up right and that's the kind of decision-making process you ought to go through right do i have it you've got it exactly right well i do i don't think people understand there's a 100 correlation with what happens to a company's earnings over several years and what happens to the stock if the company mcdonald's has done very well as a company right the stock has done very well people worry about too much money supply what's happened the price of oil who's the president who's being nominated for the supreme court it's the ozone layer there's nothing to do mcdonald's earnings go up the next 10 years the stock will go but what they will say to you peter is that as you know and why am i telling you this but it's fun to tell you this they're telling you that these other things influence the amount of earnings of a particular company if we're in a recession people are not going to spend as much money on going to the movies or whatever they do right and and therefore you got to pay attention to these other things because they impact on earth they are very important but you have no idea of knowing what they're going to do alan greenspan is the head of the federal reserve right he cannot predict interest rates yes he'd be the first to influence but he can't predict them he cannot predict what long-term interest rates are going to be one year from now two years from now three years he's even surprised how low they are now right so how am i supposed to pick interest rates how am i supposed to predict the economy you certainly remember the recession of 82 yes 1982 with a 20 prime rate 14 unemployment 12 percent inflation i don't remember anybody telling me in 1980 or 81 that was going to happen all of a sudden we had the worst recession since the depression i didn't read about in the paper so it's crazy to think about these things here's a quote from you i own dunkin donuts when you own dunkin donuts you don't have to worry about korean imports you don't have to worry about m2 or m3 these are money supply figures and what's happening to the money supply this is the way you make money if you don't understand what the company does you should not be in it if you could predict the stock market you could predict the economy you could predict interest rates if you go buy the wrong stocks you're going to lose have your money anyway right i'm saying people have natural advantages yeah let's say what you do for a living is you're involved in the restaurant industry right you supply paper products you supply kitchen equipment you help build restaurants you saw mcdonald's you saw chichi you saw chili's you saw cracker barrel you saw dunkin donuts kentucky fried chicken taco bell these are all these stories these were 40 40 fold you made 40 or 50 times your money you don't need to make that kind of money many times your life right that's all you had to do was follow the restaurant industry people are in industries they're in the publishing industry they're in the chemical industry the paper why don't they just stay within industry you only need a few stocks a decade how many good stocks you need a lifetime instead of people they're in the restaurant industry they're buying biotechnology stocks the people in the camp the people in the chemical industry are buying oil stocks it's absolutely absurd people don't understand their natural advantages and they don't use them so that's that's bad number one but worse number two if you don't think you're a good ice skater or if you're convinced you're not a good cellist you're not going to try it but people are buying stocks anyway they're not discouraged they just think it's a gamble yeah so therefore they go forward and they they bet on one stock for a week and a half and it goes up and they make two dolls on it then they sell it they buy something else when three years is over all they've done is generate a lot of commissions they've probably lost money that's a mistake so your advice is what if you don't understand a company if you can't explain it to a 10 year old in two minutes or less yes don't own it because when it goes down let's say the stock goes down too you don't understand what's going on what do you do do you buy more do you do you do you flip a chances are your broker doesn't either you they he or she certainly doesn't know about it i mean who knows what advance what all these things are at auto back planes and megaflops who knows what all this is so buy what you know buy in your industry buy what you know buy local people so so suppose you you don't have an industry i mean you know you don't really you what you buy company local companies right companies your own industry ten years after walmart went public ten years after walmart ten years after it went public it's a 25 year old company now right you could have bought the stock and made 50 times your money on it 50 times this is if you bought it 10 years after it was public already it already gone up five-fold so you could have made 250-fold but i'm saying let's say you were in a town they came into it they said boy these prices are great they're doing terrific i like the bargains you checked it out you spent a little bit of work on it yeah i mean people are very careful when they buy a dishwasher they do some research they'll put ten thousand dollars in some stock they're here on a bus so if you did a little bit of research you say walmart's only only ten percent in the country they're not even saturated there why can't they go to the rest of the country so is this this is more of the same is this it's more of the same plus i show examples it's it's a touch more detailed it actually shows me in an action right i picked 21 stocks early in 1992. some work some don't i follow those companies some of the companies the fundamentals deteriorate some they improve i watch those companies go through the year i also explain the retail industry i try and make it very simple i talk about a wonderful example is a seventh grade class yeah the teacher of that read my book and my first book that you were talking about you you and i did a show on that in washington you remember that show this is a long time ago she read the book and i said if you made it through fifth grade math you can do it in the stock market she says okay she started teaching it in seventh grade seventh grade class these kids had to study companies they had to look at their balance sheets to see if they're solving and they pick stocks these stocks were up 69 percent over two years when the market was up only 20. they picked stocks like limited they picked the gap they picked walt they understood these companies they also picked ibm i lost money on that too yeah i mean everybody makes mistakes but it did yeah but i'm saying this is this was this was the school saint agnes school in arlington mass but in addition in the decade of the 80s there's 8 000 investment clubs these are amateurs sort of right average people just investing these investment clubs 62 of them these clubs beat the market in the decade of the 80s only 25 percent of professionals beat the market let me go back to one other subject you after you're coming back to fidelity aren't you just i'm not gonna do something when i when i finish this book i've been working about one or two days a week the last year and a half on this book right now i'm done with the book i'm going to go back to maybe one day a week working with the younger analysts just listening to them talking to them i'm not telling them to buy zero zero lifestyle not totally i'm not gonna run another fund 13 years is plenty of running a fund i'm just going to work with younger analysts let them ask questions i'll ask them questions it's going to be a lot of fun now do you still follow do you manage any money for anybody other than yourself no no i manage money with other people for some charities right but no i don't manage anybody's accounts you're not doing some mutual funds no it's nothing i'm out of it cold turkey all right you called turkey cold turkey are you happy you did this i'm obviously delighted it's been and you like your new life oh it's fabulous four or five years ago you just said and i'm managing all this money i'm gonna do i'm gonna quit yep that's right and what and you went to do what well actually i want to spend more time my wife and my children right and it was an interesting situation because i loved my job i adored my job and i and i liked outside activities and when i was young you know i didn't wasn't involved in charity work until i was 30. no activities younger children you just read them a book and a good night moon and they fall asleep but it's all over when they get older there's more time involved so i enjoyed the family i was leaving for work at six in the morning i was getting home at seven o'clock at night six days a week i was in boston yeah traveling 14 days a month it was just too much so i said you know i i said that's it i can't take it and fortunately i'd made enough money to say i could give up the jobs i didn't have to give up the family or the outside activities and so what happened then so you did what with your well i cut back from about a 80 a 90 hour a week to a 40 or 50 hour week and i in the morning i make breakfasts and lunches for the kids and i do the spelling words and the spanish words carolyn does the math and the science and i uh see carol in the morning and off i go to a place you have to go to my opinion you have to go somewhere to do something if you stay at home you want to be answering the telephone or watching cartoons so yeah it's like falling asleep taking a nap so she does the hard work and i go i go finally gave me an office i have a secretary and i spend majority of the time working on charity things like inner city schools inner city libraries inner city housing you know helping people manage their money or no not at all just i'm some of the charities i'm on the investment committee of some of the museum of fine arts the you know i'm involved in national hospital boston college but united way but all the extra things i added to were real hands-on actually being involved in charitable activities

squeezing our necks and they don't know what part of while somebody is speaking we sit quietly and listen do we not understand today folks I'm gonna take you down a rabbit hole now one that I'm particularly proud of but no one's talking about it and damn it it has to be said and I'm not trying to like fear Monger here it's just the reality of the data that's just kind of they're being thrown in my face on why the Canadian economy is kind of Contracting if you're looking at the stock market so we're gonna be talking about the stocks we're going to be talking about the interest rates the inflation we're talking about real estate and what the hell is wrong with our government um and this is just I'm gonna be trying to be fairly biased with this data line you kind of come to your own conclusion but I'm sure at this point you've noticed if you're investing in the market I'm hoping you're Diversified you've got your money in the U.S because I mean look at metastock here for crying out loud the stock was like ninety dollars not even a damn year ago look where it's at today was 270 bucks I mean you take a look at the S P 500 it's up damn near 10 year to date it looks like we could be getting I mean Apple's like 0.5 away from its all-time high right now we're still pretty lucky that the Canadian economy the TSX is actually still outperforming the s p from its all-time high right I think the uh TSX only down something like 10 it's been great for dividends and income but it's been contracting against a market in the US that has actually been going up I mean we're down about 5.4 percent it looks like we're in this kind of cyclicality period but honestly why is the Canadian Market going down when the US market is going up and I'm going to tell you right now I'm going to read you a quick article this isn't the whole priority of the story here so just bear with me because this Rabbit Hole goes damn deeper than what I'm about to read here but Canada's economy grew by more than expected in the first quarter upping odds of right hikes next week now the rate hikes are obviously a bit of a fear thing for Canada we'll get to that in a sec but the last major data point before Bank of Canada's decisions add fuel to the fire of speculation for more hikes needed the Canadian economy grew at an annual utilized rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter of 2023 statistics Canada reported Wednesday the latest data showed growth beat out the federal agency's own forecasts data of 2.5 percent for the quarter a preliminary estimate suggests the economy grew by .02 percent in April after remaining flat in March do you think this would be data that would push and Propel the markets higher hey data is pretty good but stubbornly High inflation is what's killing the economy now for a while there the Canadian economy was actually boating lower inflation than the US I mean you take a look at coming into the new year here we were seeing like a much lower percentage points coming through the latter half of 2022 but lately coming into summer inflation has just been picking up and up and up and in the U.S it's kind of been a little bit staggered it's been up it's been down but it's a little lower well quite a bit lower at this point if we're continuing seeing these higher prices in Canada that you know why why is Canada's inflation out of control we're going to get to that in a moment but let's just kind of read this real quick because the Canadian economy has merged managed to continue outperforming expectations despite the Bank of Canada hoping High interest rates would cause a more profound pullback by consumers and businesses the household spending figures show spending up on both goods and services in the first three months the year after minimal growth in the previous two quarters however the report noted disposable income fell for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2021. the federal agency says disposable income declined by one percent largely due to expiration of government measures at helping people cope with inflation the Central Bank paused its rate hiking cycle earlier this year keeping at its key interest rates at 4.5 percent the highest it's been since 2007 but the central bank's Governor Tiff McLemore owned version of Jerome Powell you know the U.S federal reserve's head but he has signaled that the bank is still trying to figure out if interest rates are high enough to quash inflation the headline inflation rate ticked up slightly to 4.4 percent in April remaining well above the central bank's two percent Target why why isn't our interest rates higher I mean most people if you're not paying attention to it the U.S federal reserve you know a benchmark here their Federal Reserve rate is sitting at like just over five percent I mean they're over five percent they're getting back to where the the levels before they started cutting them in the 2008 financial crisis however the Canadian Benchmark right now our interest rate is sitting at just over four percent why did we stop raising rates well I have speculation to this no one's going to tell you this but it has everything to do with Canadian housing Canada is a very expensive place to live the average sold price of a home is sitting around 716 000 which is down about four percent over the trailing 12 months it is up over the last month and something tells me this isn't going to last transaction volume is up over the last month but down 20 over the last 12 months and that's because we're in that cycle spring is a hot time that's when people throw their properties on the market that's when volume picks up a little bit so there's probably a little bit more aspersion when it comes to the prices maybe adjusting a little bit but that's going to cool down I think if they raise the rates yet again because you know the Benchmark price from MLS is still down 13 over the last 12 months and I mean it is insanely expensive here in Toronto or Vancouver where the prices are still over a million dollars for the average cost of a home but the reason that I don't think they've raised the rates as quickly as the US is because mortgages are making up 75 percent of owed money which is basically the highest level of household debt in any G7 country mortgages make up the vast majority of Canadian debt I mean it's it's horrifying to consider that if you got a a dead almost zero interest rate one or two percent back in 2020 that you know that's either coming due this year or in 2025 if you've got a three or five year mortgage right and that and if your mortgage is over half a million dollars and that goes from two percent to five or six percent I mean you're damn you're talking about thirty thousand dollars just an annual interest payments alone I mean that's crazy right and you know Tiff Macklin said we're in this transitional period where they're not going to lower rates back to zero so there's a lot of concern about affordability and housing I mean this isn't something that's going to spark a new housing boom by any metric so there's still a horrifying amount of concern and if they raise those interest rates again what that's going to mean for the housing market but I want to talk about the real reality of what's causing this hyperinflation now we're all sitting here as Canadians looking at crude prices fall off a cliff yeah when we go to the pumps it's still costing a lot to get gas here in Canada and in fact it's it's going to get more expensive to get gas how is it going to get more expensive when the price of fuel is going down because we are getting taxed our government uh which I oppose this I mean I think it's absolutely silly that our government is taxing our gas carbon tax oh you know Canada we're definitely one of the highest carbon emitting countries on the planet let's not talk about India China or the US hey you know we want a healthy economy we want to spark Innovation so we're going to charge people more money to get their gas this is like a snake eating its own tail here when we're talking about inflation look at this the federal government is imposing a second carbon tax for fuel regulation on July 1st 2023 that tax will increase the price of gas by up to 13 cents per liter uh you know by 2023 there's no rebates for the second carbon attacks here and and this is not good this this is not good for the fact that if they keep raising the price of gas in a time where we need lower inflation well basically everything from you know costing a building a house to getting food to stores you know everything all of it all of it keeps going up it just it's going to go up that's going to lead to higher costs it's going to lead to further in inflated markets then you get the Bank of Canada that's going to want to raise the interest rates again which is going to suppress the average person even more it's like it's our government is just squeezing our necks no no they just want to see this it's like they don't want it to implode but they want it to implode let me show you the baby childness do you think the U.S politics are bad look I'm not having an opinion on politics I think they're horrible I don't hate Trudeau I don't like Trudeau polyev another guy that's trying to fight a lot of these policies he wants to get rid of carbon type let's just this is what's currently going on in our political bubble [Music] sound of his own voice and his own attacks but he does a national check the facts [Applause] they don't have a plan for the future of the Canadian economy on this side we're investing in and leveraging technologies that are cutting emissions and creating good job and we're making sure that it's no longer free to pollute while giving Canadians money back your honorable leader of the opposition so the High School Drama teacher over here accuses others of liking the sounds of their own voices this from a guy who if he were made of chocolate he would eat himself I was a high school teacher before getting into politics I'm having a little [Applause] and uh yes and he left right in the middle of the semester and I'm having trouble remembering why this is this is not a question I want to answer what part of while somebody is speaking we sit quietly and listen do we not understand it's crazy that I feel like our politics are like a high school classroom so I think people don't understand that you know in the anticipation of rate hikes the market usually tends to cool off I'm hearing a lot of different controversial like articles but I don't think people are really bringing in the full constride story of like what's driving this just Insanity in the Canadian markets now I'm always going to be a long-term bowler I love Canada I think it's a great place but we're going to see turmoil um that I don't think is comparable to many other countries just for the way it's our country set up and I think Canadians if they continue to raise rates are going to go through a much harder time than most countries just because of the Mortgage Debt and if you do have a mortgage um you're gonna be one of those people that's going to be faced with a very real decision of either you're going to have to sell your house and go rent or go live somewhere cheaper or you're going to have to stomach this insane amount of interest rate hikes and in the next couple years if you don't have a variable rate you better really preparing your finances and putting money aside or putting much larger deposits or money down on your on your mortgage to try and get those rights as always possible before that ship when it was over but I'll pass that question off to you man I'd love to know what you guys think about this

just one thousand dollars in his investment company bakeshare hathaway when he took it over you would have over 21 million dollars today even with the recent market crash this is an average return of around 20 which exceeds the return of the s p 500 which has an average return of 10 yearly now how did warren buffett get such great results and become one of the richest men in the world these results came from investing in companies and following a set of key principles that we'll cover in this video so here are the six investing principles of warren buffett number one cash is never a good investment this is something that goes with your philosophy today get out of cash and get into assets because we don't know what's going to happen to the dollar well cash is always a bad investment i mean when people said cash is king a year ago i mean that's crazy i mean cash wasn't producing anything and it was sure to go down in value over time and then you always want to be sure you have enough i mean it's like oxygen you want to be sure it's around you know but you don't need to have you don't need to have excessive amounts of it around and cash we will always have enough cash around but anytime we have surplus cash around i'm unhappy i mean i would much rather have good businesses than cash and and we found a chance in the last year thereabouts to deploy we came in with something over 40 billion in cash and we've got about 20 billion now and we've had some earnings so we put a lot of cash to work and i like that no i'd much rather own a good business than have cash uh and it is a hedge against the dollar well you can say all assets are a hedge against the dollar i mean but all you know is that the dollar is going to be worthless 10 20 30 years from now i say worth less not worthless right you want to watch that but it will be you know unless that's true of almost every currency that i can think of the question is how much it depreciates in value but cash cash is not a place at that number two invest in productive assets so you could have a cube if you owned all the gold in the world you could have a cube that would be 67 or 68 feet uh on a side and you could get a ladder and you could climb up on top of it and you could say you know i'm sitting on top of the world and you know and i think you're king of the world you could you know you could follow it you could polish it you could you could do all these things with it stare at it but it isn't going to do anything now it's all you are doing when you buy that is that you're hoping that somebody else a year from now or five years from now will pay you more to own something that again can't do anything but you're hoping that the person then thinks that somebody else will buy something five years later from him there was you're betting on not just how scared people are now of paper money you're betting on how much they think a year from now people will be scared two years from then on the third category of asset is something that you value based on it's on its what it will produce what it will deliver you buy a farm because you expect a certain amount of corn or soybeans or cotton or whatever it may be to be to come your way every year and you decide how much you pay based on how much you think the asset itself will deliver over time and those are the assets that appeal to me and charlie now there's some logical follow-on to that if you buy that farm and you really think about how many bushels of corn how many bushels of soybeans will produce how much do i have to pay the tenant farmer how much do i have to pay in taxes and so on you can make a rational calculation and the success of that investment will be determined in your own mind by whether it meets your expectations as to what it delivers logically you should not care whether you get a quote on that farm a day later a week later a month later or a year later we feel the same way about businesses when we buy this car or we buy lubrizol or whatever we don't run around getting a quote on it every week and say you know is it up or down or anything like that we look to the business we feel the same way about securities when we buy marketable security we don't care if the stock exchange closes for a few years so when we look at berkshire we are looking at what we think can be delivered from the productive assets that we own and how we can utilize that capital in acquiring more productive assets number three stay in your circle of competence defining your circle of competence is the most important aspect of investing it's not how important how large your circle is you don't have to be an expert on everything but knowing where the perimeter of that circle of what you know and what you don't know is and staying inside of it is all important tom watson senior who started ibm said in his book he said i'm no genius i said but i'm smart in spots and i stay around those spots and you know that is the key so if i understand a few things and i stick in that arena i'll do okay and if i don't understand something but i get all excited about it because my neighbors are talking about stocks are going up and everything they start fooling around someplace else eventually i'll get cream and i should number four evaluate companies first you can't keep always trying for the average person who's maybe never bought a stock before what's your advice about that you can't constantly sit there and wait and say oh it's going to go higher it's going to go higher we don't even think about that what we think about is how much is it selling for how much do we think it's worth when we bought it at 35 billion effectively i felt the company was probably worth at least 100 billion how did it come to your attention how do you find a stock like petrochina i sit there in my office and i read an annual report which fortunately was in english and it described a very good company and uh told about the oil reserves told about the refining tool about the chemicals everything else and i sat there and read it and i thought to myself this company's worth about 100 billion now i didn't look at the price first i look at the business first and trying to figure out what it's worth because if i look at the price first i'll get influenced by that so i look at the i look at the company first i try to value it and then i look at the price and if the price is way less than what i've just valued at that i'm going to buy it number five play big and don't waste opportunities all mission is way bigger than combination there's big opportunities in life have to be seized now we don't do very many things but when we get the chance to do something that's right and big we've got to do it and even to do it in a small scale is just as big a mistake almost is not doing it at all i mean you've really gotta you gotta grab them when they come because they you're not going to get 500 great opportunities you would be better off if when you got out of school here you got a punch card with 20 punches on it and every big financial every financial decision you made you used up a punch you'd get very rich because you'd think through very hard each one i mean he went to a cocktail party and somebody talked about a company he didn't even understand what they did or couldn't pronounce the name but they made some money last week and another one like it you wouldn't buy it if you only had 20 punches on that card there's a temptation to dabble if particularly during bull markets in stocks it's so easy you know it's easier now than ever because you can do it online you know just you click it in and maybe it goes up to point and get excited about that you buy another one the next day and so on you can't make any money over time doing that but if you had a punch card with only 20 punches you weren't going to get another one of the rest of your life you would think a long time before every investment decision and you would make good ones and you'd make big ones and you probably wouldn't even use all 20 punches in your lifetime but you wouldn't need to number six invest in yourself the best boat you can have is your own talent you know i mean it's they can't they can't take it away from you they inflation can't take it from you taxes can't take it from you so i i when i talk to students i see these students and i tell them you know you're a million dollar asset i would pay you a hundred thousand dollars the mbas for 10 of the earnings for the rest of your life so that makes you a million dollar asset now if you can do something increase that value 50 if you can learn to communicate better verbally or in written form and you become 50 more that's 500 000 just by improving yourself i mean not nobody can take that away from you and and so i urge everybody you know and then i talk to him in high school about this and and and colleges just do develop develop the habits you've got the brain power you've got the energy but develop the habits of success and then look around you at the people that you admire you know and list what makes you admire them compared to somebody else that looks equally strong or equally talented and those are those are things that you can do i mean just write them down and and and uh you know people like people that are there they like them if they're that they're humorous and they're friendly if they're if they're uh if they give credit to the other fellow i mean i and and they don't like them if they're stingy you know or they overstate and over promise and all those sort of things well that's decision that's a decision you make so so i i encourage everybody to build your own moat around yourself all right guys i wanted to start this series for us to learn from some of the most successful people in the world and absorb their knowledge every single week in the comments below let me know who would you like me to cover next in our six rules of money series if you like this video make sure to give it a thumbs up it really helps us with the youtube algorithm and as always thank you for watching and i will see

Warren Buffett | How To Invest For Beginners: 3 Simple Rules",51246.0,3156690,6365,i had started investing when i was 11. i just dithered away until when i was seven or eight nine but so unfortunately i didn't get started till i was 11. but i bought my first stock when i was 11 and then i experimented with a whole bunch of things like timing of stocks and charting and doing all these crazy things it was a lot of fun profitless but a lot of fun and i did that until i was 19. and i read all the books on investing in the public library and just i ate it up it was fascinating to me but i had no framework i was just searching for something i was hoping that little things on a chart would tell me something about what a stock was going to do it was kind of crazy but everybody else was doing it so i figured i'd do it too sometimes you turn the chart upside down you know it still wouldn't help then in 1949 i read the intelligent investor by ben graham i'd never heard of them up until then and there are really only two chapters in that book that are the key to it but they set my philosophical framework for investing in three ways they're so basic and so simple it's hard to understand how they could be that important but the ten commandments are simple you know the first is that a stock is part of a business i mean you you can't think of a sock as something different it's you value a business and then you divide by the shares outstanding but what you have to think about is what kind of a business are you getting into what are its economic characteristics for its competitors what's its management like all of these things that relate to a business instead of a little ticker symbol i used to know when i was 11 or 12 the ticker symbols of every company virtually on the new york stock exchange i could mark the boards of harris up them you know but i didn't know anything i mean i could you know i knew that x was u.s steel and t was at t and so on but i didn't i didn't know anything i didn't know what was behind them so i had to start looking at at these little symbols or these little names in the paper as businesses and decide how do you value a business what counts the second thing in that in the book is that graham gives you a marvelous set point in terms of how the investor should react to stock market fluctuations he talks about his mythical mr market in chapter eight there's been no better thing written in terms of the investors attitude toward stock prices most people react the wrong way to stock prices i mean they feel good when their stocks go up they feel bad when they go down they think the stock market is there to instruct them and mr market is this partner you have in investing you know he's a remarkably obliging partner this guy comes around every day and he tells you what he'll pay you for your interest in the business or what he'll sell you more at the same price nobody ever does that in in private business if you owned you and i owned a gas station together and i said every day i want you to come in and offer me your half interest in the station and i can either buy your half or sell you my my half at the same price and you have to come in every day and do it you'd be at a terrible disadvantage and you'd be at a particular disadvantage if you're mr market in the market because mr market or a friend of the market who obligingly gives you those figures every day different figures at the end of the day in the start of the day but he's naming a price at which you'll either buy herself the beautiful thing about him is that this guy is an alcoholic manic depressive i mean i mean he is as unsound as they come he wanders around all day you know and looks at the crazy things and he you know he he's going to name all kinds of crazy prices and you don't have to pay any attention to them except when it's to your advantage to do so if that's once a year if it's once every five years it's one stock out of three thousand all you have to do is sit there there you have no moral responsibility to this jerk you know i mean he is naming these numbers you didn't ask him to but he's doing it and all you have to do is pick the one time when he is particularly depressed or particularly manic or particularly drunk or whatever it may be and the market will be all of those things and and you take advantage of it and that's what's remarkable about stocks if you think about it is that if you look at the high and low on all of these american companies for the last year you'll see case after case after case where the high is twice below now that's for sound american businesses running along paying people selling goods and so on if you go out look at farmland 10 miles from here there's no way in the world over here that the farmland is going to range in value from x to 2x it doesn't maybe go from x to 110 of x or vice versa if you look at an apartment house near here and figures on essentially apartment houses like that over a year it won't it won't move 10 in a given year but here are the finest of american businesses and people just name these numbers that go all over the place and you don't have to play except when you want to that's the important thing and that's the that's what graham tells you the market isn't there to instruct you to tell you anything the markets is there just basically to serve you when you want it to serve you you know one of the most important things remember in stocks very hard to do but people have all these feelings about it the stock doesn't know you own it you know you're sitting there with these certificates for berkshire the company doesn't even know you own it you know and the stock doesn't it's trading now and they don't know you own it so it has no feelings about you i mean you've got all these feelings about it but it's just part of a business if berkshire is worth 75 000 times a million and a half shares you know roughly 110 billion or something like that it's a good investment if it isn't it's a lousy investment you know you have to value the business and graham you know it's amazing but people don't do that in wall street you bet you you hear price targets or that kind of thing but you see no one write a paper that says here is the nature of this business over the next 20 years you know what will that what should that business sell for forget about what it's selling for in fact one of the things i always like to do when i'm looking at investments is i like to look at them without knowing the price because if you see the price it automatically has some influence on you if you just sit down with the reports if i get an idea about looking up a company and i get these 10ks and so on i would rather not know the price because i'd rather value it without knowing the price when i used to handicap horses when i was a kid one of the things i would do is i'd get the racing form ahead of time and if there were nine horses in a race will say obviously the probabilities of of each one winning the race had to add up to 100 percent i mean one horse was going to win the race absent a dead heat or all of them dropping dead on the backstretch so if you went through the racing form and i would look at the third race at hialeah i would try to figure out the percentage chance of each horse winning the race and that had to add to 100 then i would compare those percentages to the odds but i first of all i wouldn't look at the odds first i would look at the past performance and all that thing first stock market's the same way third thing in graham's book is the margin of safety if you come up to a bridge and it says capacity ten thousand pounds and you're driving a 9 800 pound truck you drive down further and find another bridge i mean you know they nobody knows exactly what that capacity is and it may have been signed may have been put up three years ago so you always leave a margin of safety you don't try to cut things that close you wait till something kind of shouts at you in the stock market and uh with those three principles you can build all kinds of all kinds of structures on that but that's the foundation and if you've got that in mind and that's in the intelligent investor i've never found anything that remotely compares with all three of the ones i just you can't get rid of one leg of the three-legged stool and still have a good investment philosophy but i would say that the most important thing uh over a long period and working with big money uh is to understand the business let's just say for the moment that you were given a million dollars or whatever some was necessary and you could look around knoxville or look around all of tennessee if you want and buy into any three businesses you know between now and a week from now private businesses not trading or anything of the sort you've got a week to do it or you have to give the money back what will you be doing during the next week i mean you can look at all these companies some of them you're quite familiar with some of them you're less familiar with some you know by reputation some of them you know the management some of them you know you know their competitive situation what will you be thinking about during that seven day period how will you actually be screening these companies out i think you look for three businesses and you can't trade them after you buy them you're just gonna you're gonna own the rest of your life you're gonna be looking for businesses that have enduring competitive advantage you don't want to buy a burger king franchise just because nobody's come within 10 miles of it yet because you know wendy's and donald's and all of those will be there pretty soon it isn't necessarily who's earning the most money now you're going to look for something with enduring competitive advantage now that takes a business with some kind of a moat around it because capitalism by definition is a system where every time somebody has an economic castle somebody else is going to come after it's just the nature if you open a restaurant that's successful here in town you know somebody's going to take your menu and probably take your chef maybe cut your price maybe offer a little more parking maybe be a better better okay whatever i mean capitalism consists of going after the other guy's castle if that's the case you want a castle with a big moat around it there's a lot of ways you can have a motor on something you could have it by patent protection you could have it by location in certain certain areas i mean if you have something in people's mind like coca-cola six billion people in the world practically all of them have something in their mind about coca-cola largely favorable they don't have anything in their mind about rc cola and if rc cola spent a billion dollars advertising they wouldn't have anything in their mind about rc cola but they've got something in their mind about coke and generally it's favorable that's why coke wants to be where people are happy because they want to be at the theater they want to be at disney world they want to be at the world series they want always have you drinking that drink of coca-cola while at the same time experiencing happiness and if they do that they're going to sell a lot of coca-cola and it won't make any difference if somebody is a half a cent less of some serving than coke so that's an enduring competitive advantage and you want it run by honest enabled people don't want to go in with a crook and you don't want to go in with a dope now the best businesses to buy are the ones where you could have a dope in there i mean peter lynch says you know buy a business that's so good that an idiot can run it because sooner or later one will you know and and there's some merit to that uh in fact i got a question the other day from this student group and they said you know what's going to happen to berkshire when you go gaga and i said well berkshire's so good that i can go gaga in fact i may even be you know those are the kind of businesses to own so you want but you want a management that's able and honest and then you want a price that's sensible and that's what you'd look for you go around tennessee got a week to do it and you'd immediately screen out a whole bunch of things you just know that they weren't a fertile area you know that's an important thing to be able to do to know just get rid of all kinds of things there was a great article in the new yorker 30 years ago when bobby fischer was playing spassky in famous chess match which drew attention around the world and they examined how the mind could with billions and billions and billions of possibilities how it could group things so it immediately cast it down to where you had like four options and of course when the humans play something like deep thought you know or whatever the latest version is of the computer on that that computer is making maybe 700 000 or a million calculations a second and the human mind is competing against that but the computer is checking every possibility and the human mind somehow has this ability to cast out 99.999 percent of those things that the computer has to go through in order to focus on the three or four possibilities that really make sense and invest things a lot like that's not that tough because there aren't that many companies but you want to cast out all kinds of things if somebody told me that my life depended on picking among the dow jones stocks a group of 10 that would be the best performers or outperform the index as a whole i would spend my time thinking of the worst up companies in there i would cast out things and then i would figure i left those behind and that's an easier way to approach the problem actually than than trying to pick the 10 best if you were thinking about the state of tennessee you know there's a whole lot of things you wouldn't examine you just figure they're too tough you might decide you know car dealerships were too tough it's always going to be competitive who knows whether ford or general motors are going to be selling more cars five years now or whether there's me terrorists on foreign who knows so you just say i'll give up on car dealers i'll pick your budget i'll think about something else and that approach that you use there is the same approach you really want to bring the stock market you've got 3 000 companies tonight you can look at on the new york stock exchange there's a valuation on every one of them it'll change tomorrow you don't have to play once a year if you have 20 good if you have five good ideas in your lifetime to get very rich you know i i tell students sometimes they'd be better off if they had a punch card when they got out of school with only 20 punches on it because then instead of listening to somebody at a cocktail party and then glass the next morning buying some shirts they'd really think about every punch that's all the punches you get 20 punches is plenty you just have to make sure that you don't do any of them for frivolous reasons we never want to buy anything small at berkshire it just doesn't make any difference you know we want to think about things that can move the needle and that gets tougher as the capital gets greater but that's the way to focus on investments

to predict everything the stock market's going to do in the future look if anyone tells you that never believe them they're probably just trying to sell you one of those courses for 997 dollars so even though there's no magic ball that can tell you when to buy a stock before it rockets in value and makes you a millionaire overnight there is certainly a few things i do to tip the odds in my favor and that's what i'd like to share with you guys today as i've got older and slightly grayer i've found that knowing the reason behind why i stopped my changing prices helped me make and save a lot of money if you're new to the stock market then a stock is a small part of a company and when you buy you actually become a part owner the idea is to buy parts of a company that you believe will go up in value so you're able to multiply your money without doing any extra work but let's face it investing in the stock market can be pretty confusing and most people just pick companies on a whim however that's not how i do it so by the end of this video you'll know my actual strategies for picking great stocks and don't worry i won't be trying to sell you anything so you can just sit back and relax so there are two main ways to attempt to predict the stock market these are called technical and fundamental analysis a good way to think about this is like a scale usually short-term day traders are purely focused on technical aspects these include looking at charts and patterns they believe that they can predict how the stock will change in price by judging the highs and the lows on the graphs they're the geeky ones nah i'm only kidding it's just not how i do it my whole investment strategy is about keeping it simple lots of people talk about using margin and options but that's really not something i worry about i'm a long-term investor so this means i'm a lot more focused on the fundamentals of a company this includes the financials the leadership and the brand recognition as i believe this is where the information lies to indicate the long-term success of a stock however like i mentioned it's a scale so i do cast my eye over the occasional chart in order to find the best time to buy this approach has helped me to find some really good investments over the years rather than just dipping in and out and trying to make a profit on a daily basis the amazing thing is the majority of professional traders are still unable to be a low-cost index fund over the long term this may sound quite complicated but it's actually very simple so this bucket represents an individual stock and the water is me pumping all of my money into that company this represents an index fund each cup being a different company and the water i'm putting in is the money i'm spreading between each of them in one easy investment for whatever reason if this company goes bankrupt then guess what or my money goes down the drain now this is the same company and it still goes bankrupt but the good thing is i may lose my money in that small investment however i've got so many more stocks and i've done really well in some of them which means i've actually made a profit overall my favorite index funds track the s p 500 which are the top 500 public companies in the usa so even though the majority of my money goes into index fund investing i also have a lot of fun picking individual stocks and watching my portfolio grow on this note if you'd like an easy way to get started public are currently giving away a free stock worth all the way up to 50 dollars when you fund your account if you want to pick that up i'll leave a link in the description and if you're in the uk free trade are giving away a free stock that could be worth up to 200 pound when you deposit as little as two pounds i'll leave that link below as well it's a great way to get started with individual stocks and basically it's free money right so now you've got your free stock and you're ready to invest into some more but where should you start well if you're anything like me it makes sense to start with the numbers we call this quantitative analysis whenever i'm thinking about investing in a company i make sure to look at all these figures first if the financials don't look good to me then it's very rare that i do any further research into the company it's kind of like when you go on a first date with someone and they seem really nice however it isn't until you really start getting to know all the details about them that you might start to notice their flaws like eating with their mouth open or picking their nose if only they gave you a non-biased comprehensive list of how they actually are so you can make an educated decision whether you want to date them or not i don't have a solution to this problem but luckily that's exactly what companies do it's brilliant you can find out this information for free on yahoo finance which is the website that i use there are three main aspects that i look at first let's break down the balance sheet i know it doesn't sound too interesting but trust me this is where you find some of the real juicy information the whole purpose of this sheet is in the name to balance assets and liabilities think of it a bit like this you may own a watch or a rental property and these are your assets but let's say you have loads of credit card debt this is one of your liabilities so let's break down some of the gobbledygook terms so you can easily understand this complicated looking sheet and impress your friends assets are broken down into three categories current assets are things that could be turned into cash within 12 months longer term assets are things like their headquarters which they usually don't sell in a hurry companies can also have assets that you can't physically touch known as non-tangible assets such as the brand recognition of an established business that has been trusted for generations i like to think of coca-cola and then we come to the liabilities and what i'm really interested in here are the current liabilities as this is the debt that they'll need to repay within 12 months with this there is a simple calculation you can do to easily know if the company is high risk or not and that is total current assets divided by total current liabilities a good rule of thumb here is the number should be above one but how does this work in practice let's take apple's balance sheet for example apple's total current assets divided by their total current liability comes to 1.4 when rounded up this is great as now we know that apple are able to pay off all their short-term debt nearly one and a half times the second document that's really important to have a look at is the income statement if you've ever heard the saying of the top and bottom line this is where it comes from at the top of the statement this is the total revenue which is the total the business take and at the bottom is the net income which is the money the company makes after all the expenses have been deducted every business has these expenses the cost of operation and the cost of revenue so let's take a simple business like a smoothie company their cost of revenue is fruit they can't make the smoothies without buying that therefore that is a cost they have no choice about it's a simple fact of running their business but the next thing they do have a choice about which is their operating expenses who they're hiring and what kind of wages that they're paying them after these expenses are deducted from the total amount of money they take from their customers you get the operating income so here's my simple calculation that lets me know if the business is healthy operating income divided by total revenue times 100 ideally i look for above 15 using apple again let's take this number divided by this number and we get 27 which is great the last one of the big three is the statement of cash flow i'm not going to spend too much time on this one as when you boil it down it's pretty simple the main thing i look out for is if the company i'm investing in has increase in free cash flow year on year which is money they can use to reinvest or pay back to investors a big red flag here is sometimes i see the cash flow is negative but the company is still paying dividends back to its investors it's just unsustainable and eventually the business is just going to run out of cash now once i've had a good look at all these numbers it's time to get into the juicy stuff and that's all about analyzing the qualities of a company this is known as qualitative analysis one of the qualities i look for is brand recognition when i say the word apple most people think about the company rather than the fruit i know i keep referring to it but it's a great example of amazing brand recognition that won't be going away anytime soon being a household brand name comes with a lot of consumer trust so when they launch a new product people are much more likely to try it out especially if it's something unique or groundbreaking such as the ipad and we like to show it to you today for the first time and we call it the ipad this helps companies like apple shape our future and create entire new markets and revenue streams another great example of brand awareness is coca-cola it's the second most recognized word in the world after okay something that really affects price movements is the news i always keep an eye on it and in particular rumors on social media you may have heard about the whole gamestop situation where a small bunch of retail investors managed to outsmart the top hedge funds by finding a flaw in their strategy they were able to use this to their advantage and earn a lot of money tonight it's wall street's david versus goliath the struggling video game retailer gamestop skyrocketing about 8 000 percent over six months but once the news broke and more people started to jump onto the bandwagon the big profits had already been made this is a great example of the age old saying buy the rumor sell the news i learned this valuable lesson during the dot-com boom in the 90s when i started investing people were amazed that i was pouring money into companies whose main asset was a dot-com domain name however within six months it seemed that everyone's telling me that they were buying shares in dot-com companies even my hairdresser i decided to start selling to buy more real estate just weeks before the bubble burst and i managed to save the majority of my profits others weren't so lucky everyone thought that internet businesses were the future and they were eventually right however most of the original companies never recovered and i saw some of my friends make millions just to lose 90 percent of their investment when everything crashed only a handful of companies managed to weather the storm such as amazon this showed me that the hype generated by the news and other people talking about it really just caused the prices to get out of control and become unsustainable so whenever i feel like hype is driving the price of a particular stock i know that it probably isn't a great long-term investment although with the dot-com bubble it is true that a lot of companies did rebound eventually the next important factor is the leadership of the company even more so nowadays with social media and what the leaders say is having a huge effect on the price of the stock a prime example of this is elon musk who is very clearly the visionary behind all of his companies one of them of course being tesla just imagine if elon musk decided he was bored of making electric cars and tweeted that he was standing down from tesla to focus on spacex and his mission to colonize mars i think this reliance on elon musk is one of tesla's greatest strengths but also one of its greatest weaknesses as the company is highly affected by his actions this brings me to my next point which is to look out for emerging future industries like electric vehicle technology which tesla is leading the way in these types of investments are really your growth stocks my friend simon squibb often tells me he believes that in the future doctors will be replaced by artificial intelligence this sounds like the stuff of science fiction however when i was younger this was what i used to see on star trek spark spark here in fact this is even better i actually first heard of tesla when it was featured on top gear in 2008 it wasn't a very flattering review as they showed the car running out of batteries in 50 miles which was only a quarter of the advertised range elon wasn't very happy about this and he actually later filed a lawsuit against the show however the segment certainly piqued my interest and i could see they were onto something during my time investing i've seen a huge shift in each sector or if you're american at home sectors let me take you back to when i was younger if you can imagine that far back i remember sitting at my grandma's house and watching this guy come along with a sack of coal on his back which he would deliver to my grandma so she could heat her house nowadays most people use gas so no more mr coleman and this sector is all set to change again with the introduction of renewable electricity but that's three major shifts that i'll experience in my lifetime if i'd been stuck in my ways and not taking notice of these changes then my investments would have been left in the past just like the coal industry so before investing in a stock i always think about whether a future shift in sector will have a positive or negative impact on that company but how do i predict when the best time to buy is you don't but there's a strategy i use to get around this and it's called dollar cost averaging let's imagine you were to invest once a month for three months month one the stock might cost you two hundred dollars month two hundred and fifty dollars a month three hundred and thirty dollars of course if you knew it was going to dip to 130 you'd have bought then however no one knows how low the price will go but by doing this instead of investing all your money in month one when your stock was at 200 you actually lower your average buying price to 160 dollars this is also known as buying the dip instead of getting scared and selling like the majority of people would the idea is to buy more because it's like having a garage sale and if you've done all your research and you like the company then the stock is at a bargain price so i'm going to leave the next video right up there but don't click on it just yet make sure to subscribe for more videos and pick up your free stocks with the links below okay i'll see

I think it's easily possible for Sofi to get back up there in the next year or two and we'll see at the end of this video I will come up and show you what the analysts on Wall Street believe I will give you the price predictions the so five price prediction we will see if these are the top Investments to make for 2023 especially in June I know what you're saying also don't you think there's going to be a recession coming Moe I do but I also think some stocks such as Sofi when you look at this thing have been beaten up so far that they're a limited downside in any positive Catalyst could actually propel them through a recession and I think this is one of them companies that give us that opportunity not all companies are going to make it through a recession in terms of hey they didn't they went up well some of them are still going to get beat up it's just are they going to get beat up more than the market or not I think so far has that chance to actually outperform the market even with the recession the next of the best growth stocks to buy now the the top Investments to make look at DraftKings this year 110 up remember what I told you that draftking should be the leader when it comes to the sports wagering if anybody has files that that sector I believe that DraftKings was going to be your ultimate winner now you see this and you say mo that's a hundred and ten 110 up that's huge yeah but if you go out to five years you see they are still trading 67 percent down from that top could they get back up there well if they did you would see this run uh probably about 200 percent up from where we're at now just to get back up to Prior hires could we see that we could I think that's a ways down the road but I think revisiting 40 here in the low 40s that we are at and the end of 2021 is not impossible to do so I do feel pretty good about that and I could see that happening in the next uh hopefully we see that happening in the next two years as the FED drops the race back down I think a lot of money will flow back into the markets and these more risky stocks will get a lot of love and you could see them running up as they are newer companies growth companies and that's what I'm looking for we'll look at the DraftKings price prediction at the end of this video the next of the best growth stocks to buy now we got a volunteer out there and for those that don't know we know that Kathy Wood has been loading the boat with this one and there are quite a few YouTubers out there to file this stock as well they have gotten a lot of love and for good reason they're up 130 for the year and if you come out there go five years they're not they're nowhere close to where they were they're 58 down sort of reminds you of the DraftKings right and we know they got the AI tie-in the government contract tracks all the good stuff the question is will they return to their former glory and I do believe the answer is yes I think we could see this thing run back up and we'll see how it does like I said but I did want to add this to the list of ones I'm looking to load up so when people hear me you guys hear me talking about this list of the best growth stocks to buy for 2023 in June these are the ones I will DCA into as we get through all these different moments in time there's no right answer to say hey when are you gonna buy when are you going to sell when are you gonna do this I don't have the crystal ball I wish I did but I don't have that DC crystal ball that a lot of people have so we got to come up with the strategies based on the data based on what the FED tells us that the fed's continuing to raise rates that's tough on growth companies so you got to be careful you don't want to load all up while the fed's still in quantitative tightening so I am watching all these events but it doesn't mean we can't start taking positions and then dcaing through it but that's something we'll talk about the next of the best best growth stocks to buy now of course should be no surprise to anybody it is Tesla I absolutely love Tesla this thing gets 40 of its Revenue in China so the risk is China isn't doing as well as we thought they would be doing but they are doing quantitative easing which is big for Tesla but we are going to see recessions like I said before Germany's in a recession UK could be staring at one and this will affect Tesla in the U.S is staring at one will we see them in the second half of 2023 like a lot of analysts are predicting I think so as well so yes I think we will so it could be a bumpy road but dcaing through that bumpy road could help us now we look at Tesla take a look at the year down 20 percent but from the highs it's still down 50 so I gave you a few stocks that people were buying when they're at the highs now I give you a chance to look at these at 50 off or more from those highs and people will they walk away and it's always funny it's like when the stocks are high people want to jump open with both feet but when they get cut in half or even more they're like I don't want to touch that what's changed well they I know they increased the revenue and things are getting better I don't want to touch it now though I want to wait till it's up another 100 200 before I jump back in and that's not the way to do it we got to make sure we are looking at these and taking advantage so it's up to you these are higher risks but one of the highest risks of the best stocks to buy now I have is coinbase why because obviously they're fighting it out with the government anytime I see that it is a big red flag to con to absolutely watch yourself there's no guarantees it's going to come out winning but if they do and I think they can we could see some good things they're trying to follow all the rules and regulations they just need to be told what they are all right and so we'll watch this over you can see from the high it's down about 82 percent uh year to date it is up 82 percent so there you go I like coinbase and I believe the crypto industry will continue to absolutely explode moving forward especially once we get through quantitative tightening the money comes the the Fed rate comes down money gets cheaper people are throwing money everywhere we got a record amount of money on the sidelines right now outside of equities all I can see is crypto and equities especially some of these high growth just exploding higher once we get through this period of uncertainty such as the recession the FED tightening so once the FED finally gets into quantitative easing this is one of the stocks I think is going to explode up let's take a look at the price predictions out there and this is you can see these are top analysts on Wall Street they average them together and you can see they have the Sofi price prediction 26 percent up now I absolutely love this I have the stock Mo patreon you can come over and check that out I'll be adding certain stocks when I'm buying and selling over there you can find that then the next of the best stocks to buy now of course we got DraftKings 24.52 percent upside potential according to the top analysts on Wall Street the next pollen tier 30 downside watch it if you think the top analysts know what they're talking about you stay away from this one now me personally I still like it I think it has potential that's up to you uh but

Dave Ramsey: How To Invest For Beginners",31412.0,1177789,2244,you guys know by now that i'm a firm believer that the borrower is slave to the lender because your most powerful wealth building tool is your income and when you haven't committed your income in the form of payments to everybody else you can invest it and become wealthy really the average car payment in america today is 503 dollars that's just cray-cray that's nutty if you invest 500 in a decent growth stock mutual fund from age 30 to age 70 you'll have over 5 million dollars that one thing will make you worth 5 million isn't that amazing and so i've become known for getting people out of debt and it changes your life it changes your family tree it changes your retirement you retire with dignity you don't have to buy that cookbook 72 ways to prepare alpo and love it but you have to do it on purpose and getting out of debt in order to invest is the shortest way and what is amazing to me is that almost the entire financial industry focuses on one part of the equation and that's the investing part of the equation and they all have a bunch of theories now i've had all the letters and licenses after my name i have a degree in finance i've had all the licenses in the business it is amazing the number of people in the financial world whether they're financial advisors writers bloggers whatever they do that have opinions about money that don't have any money and whose track record on teaching people to invest in getting them to invest sucks three percent of the public is where all of those people make their money off wealthy people they make all their money off wealthy people and most of the advisors out there won't fool with you if you don't have some money they don't want to sit down and talk to you and so we start teaching people of course all these years ago how we invest and then as we've met with many many many thousands of millionaires over the years how did they invest what are they doing well we suggest and i personally invest in good growth stock mutual funds i spread it across four types growth and income growth aggressive growth and international and i buy mutual funds that have at least a 10-year track record well dave shouldn't you just buy index funds well you can if you want index funds basically an s p 500 fund mirrors the market that basically is the stock market and so you're going to do exactly what the stock market does good or bad the mutual funds that i buy outperform the s p 500 and they're really not that hard to find a lot of mutual funds don't outperform the s p 500 so if you're going to buy that well that'd be dumb just buy an s p 500 but i buy mutual funds that outperform the s p 500 and my portfolio mix that i just outlined as pretty much always beats the market because i buy funds that outperform the market it's not that hard to do you open up the prospectus and there's two little lines on the graph one of them is the s p 500 if the mutual fund you're looking at if that line is below that s p 500 line don't buy that bun this is hard really not that much to this but dave you just tell people buy those loaded funds yeah they'll pay a commission that's fine have somebody in your life helping you do the investing all the data says that you'll continue to invest doing that but when you out there by yourself with all your theories and some idiot newscaster comes on the evening news predicting the end of the world what do you do you cash out all your mutual funds at exactly the wrong time because you don't have anybody in your corner saying don't jump don't jump instead you're just out there with your own emotions in the newscaster and that's how you pick out when you jump in or out of the market and that's just dumb so all the data says a decent portfolio of good performing mutual funds wins and the big thing is actually putting money into the mutual funds actually investing one piece of research shows that 74 of the reason of retirement success is doing it it's called savings rate the number of you that put money in versus talk about it and continually put money in year after year year after year year after year month after month week after week out of your check into your 401k over and over and over and over and over again this is how you get wealthy it's ludicrous i know a lot about mutual funds and let me tell you i pick mutual funds about 80 percent of the choice on my mutual fund 85 is based on its rate of return its track record if the track record's tied and i'm trying to look i look for the longest track record who's been doing it a long time i like neighborhoods with big oak trees when i'm buying real estate you see what i'm saying i like a long track record something stable i don't like risk i like to make money risk equals not making money for me big risk anyway we said spread it across four types growth and income growth aggressive growth and international let's talk about those for a second because there's all kinds of names for mutual funds and the name of the mutual fund tells you what is in the fund okay a growth and income fund is also called a large cap fund sometimes also called a blue chip fund now the blue chip is the most expensive chip on the poker table so that means these are big companies in this large cap is short for large capitalization large capitalization means these are large companies and so your growth and income funds are large companies boring of the four types of mutual funds that i put money into and i recommend this is the calmest if you were to chart this volatility on this fund versus the stock market you would see it's a lot calmer than the market and so it's your friend when things are going down in other words it's your stable it's the big old dinosaur companies they're boring when things are going up by the way it's also boring it's not exciting when things are going up it's a downer you look at that thing going why is it not doing well when the rest of the market's going up because it goes slower than the market up and slower than the market down because it's a stable land a growth fund is right in the middle the s p 500 index fund would be considered a growth fund a growth fund is companies that are growing they're kind of medium-sized companies so you might hear it call mid cap fund these are just standard growth stock mutual funds there's a whole lot of these out there ton of funds that fall in this area the idea is pretty simple the growth fund that's kind of right there in the middle you want something in the middle it's pretty much going to do about what the market does in terms of volatility but you can get mutual funds that are growth stock mutual funds that outperform the s p 500 you can even get growth in income funds even though they're not as volatile that outperform the s p 500 then there's the aggressive growth fund this is the wild brother okay it's the crazy one and so you might guess it's going to be also called a small cap funds these are the small companies the startups a lot of tech companies would fall into there very crazy all the fun weird stuff is in there and that means some of it fails and goes to zero and so it's a crazier mix it's gonna be much more volatile than the stock market is so it's gonna go up faster than the market goes up but it's going to go down faster than the market goes down small cap aggressive growth stock mutual funds also known in there as a merging market you would call it that too as well international funds means that the stocks in it are overseas companies they're not american companies it has a kissing cousin called a global fund if you think of a globe what is it it's everything so that would have international and u.s companies in a global fund and it would be a cousin to an international by the way american companies generally outperform other international companies by and large as a group and so your international fund will be your worst performing of the four over the last several decades and a global fund will outperform an international fund because you put some spice in there you put some american companies in there usually and so they're a little bit better but at least you got some stuff overseas you're not a hundred percent betting on the american economy not that i'm anti-american i am not this is not a patriotic thing this is a diversification thing and so you know you want to have some bmw and some mercedes in there you want to have some lg and some other stuff even though some of those things are made stateside those are foreign companies and so you look for companies that are overseas based could be a french company could be whatever that are in an international fund and then you spread your investing across those four types very simple here the thing is do it that's the thing everybody talks and talks and talks and talks and talks about investing the problem is nobody does it people we talk to on the millionaire theme hour that are millionaires you know they got to be millionaires they did it and they never want to ask them how they became millionaires they never say oh man i hit the home run they never say that because it never happens oh dave i hit the home run i got this mutual fund that went straight up and i made all my money and one goodbye you know my golfing buddy gave me a stock tip i don't meet millionaires that did that i hear stories about it but a golfing buddy with a stock tip is like a golfing buddy with a fishing story the one that got away i mean it's just everybody's got an opinion and it's all a bunch of crap and so you just have to really stop and go slow and steady actually investing is the way it's the way it's the only way to go so growth and income growth aggressive growth international don't chase the returns do not invest money in things you do not understand people get ripped off when they invest money in things that someone told them is good and they trusted the person instead of knowing what the flip they were doing you know all these athletes you read about the nfl stars and they lost 10 million dollars or they made 100 million dollars and it's all gone and you know you know how they lose their money because they give it to someone else to handle and they don't even look at it and then they're shocked to find out that person was a crook that's how you lose your money it's your money it's like it's your kids which means you have to make it behave it's like you have to make your kids behave you have to do that if you want good kids that's how it's going to happen if you want money that's how it's going to happen you have to understand it now you don't have to have a master's degree in finance this stuff is not rocket science it is really not that difficult you really really seriously have to do this and you have to understand what the money is going into do not put money in that's why when you're buying insurance when you're getting a mortgage doing your investing in mutual funds that's why when you do all of that that you have to understand what you're doing and the only way you're going to do that is when you're picking someone to help you in one of those areas you're doing your estate plan if it's complicated you're doing your taxes if they're complicated that kind of thing you need someone sitting on the other side of the table that is not a salesperson but they have the heart of a teacher not the heart of a salesperson i'm an easy sale once i understand something but until i understand it i'm not putting a dime in it i'm not going forward with this it's that simple

and the tech heavy NASDAQ Composite plunged more than 30 percent investors can blame the downturn in markets on Raging inflation a hawkish fed the war in Ukraine and a looming Global recession but in every downturn there's still opportunity we spoke with several top performing fund managers who strongly believe this is now a stock Pickers Market here are their 20 best ideas for stocks in 2023 the first two stock picks come from Charles limonitis at valueworks he likes cord energy which is ideal for a bumpy period in markets as it is a defensive play with huge cash generation and is also selling an exceedingly attractive valuation the company was formed in July after the successful merger of Oasis and Whiting petroleum and owns nearly 1 million net Acres of drilling rights cord energy is also very shareholder friendly returning the great bulk of its more than one billion in free cash flow over the last few years to shareholders in the form of BuyBacks or dividends his second pick is air lease which purchases commercial aircraft and leases them to Airline customers worldwide the industry has gone through a tumultuous experience during the pandemic but the company has basically been financially healthy relative to many of its peers though it has some debt with travel rebounding and many planes at full capacity again air lease is poised to benefit from pricing flexibility and a huge Fleet of aircrafts the next picks come from James Davalos at kinetic small cap opportunities fund he highlights defense technology company khaki International which he thinks covers all the right niches that are relevant to National Security unlike Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman which manufactures missiles and planes khaki specializes in Battlefield Communications encryption and cyber security even after Rising nearly 10 percent in 2022 shares of the company remain cheap on an absolute basis according to Davalos especially when compared with more traditional defense contractors that have heavy Capital expenditures he also likes the Permian Basin royalty trust the trust itself is a passive royalty on the Waddell Ranch the lease on which was bought up by a private company named Blackbeard operating just over two years ago the small cap operator has already made some exciting improvements to Old Wells by injecting fluid or carbon dioxide and though relatively cheap per well those costs have obscured the dividend in the short term according once Blackbeard's Capital expenditures taper off however Davalos predicts the stock could easily be Distributing a dividend of up to three or four dollars per share next year the next stocks come from Kimball Brooker at first Eagle Global fund Brooker likes HCA Healthcare the largest hospital company in the United States with more than 180 sites of care because it has developed a market share big enough so they can use scale to create the best facilities around he says unlike most hospitals which are not for profit the company is able to reinvest significant cash to upgrade facilities and thereby attract better doctors and improve patient outcomes Bricker also likes Comcast which may appear to have a mountain of debt roughly 90 billion at the end of September but in reality the company has used these years of low rates to take advantage of reasonably cheap financing he says one potential Catalyst to watch for in the next few years is Comcast roughly 33 stake in Hulu which has an upcoming putt option allowing the company to sell to Disney at a minimum total valuation of around 27 billion dollars for Hulu that could result in roughly nine billion dollars for Comcast the next stocks come from Thomas Huber at T Rowe Price dividend growth fund he likes becton Dickinson because it's a good defensive Growth Company though it has struggled with disappointing margins and an FDA recall on its Alerus infusion pump last year still he says the worst is behind it the company is slowly raising its dividend yield and there's good money to be made Aid in companies as they improve and come out of a troubled period he also likes Philip Morris International which has been a long time holding of the fund since 2008 because it's a stock where you're paid to wait thanks to its five percent dividend yield the tobacco company is nicely set up as we go into next year thanks to the success of its main product the ecos device which uses heat rather than burn technology to consume tobacco not only is it a healthier alternative to regular cigarettes the reduced risk product category has higher margins than the core traditional tobacco business the next two picks come from Christopher morangia the cabelli value 25 fund his first pick is the Liberty Braves he highlights this tracker stock which rose 12 percent last year and owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team as well as the real estate development rights around the ballpark moringi says that by buying the stock at market price today you're buying equity in the Braves at roughly 1.5 billion dollar valuation other teams like the New York Mets have sold for more than two billion dollars during covid and the Braves generate much more Revenue he points out he predicts that if the team gets sold it could Garner evaluation nearing three billion dollars meringue also likes Dish Network despite a nearly 58 decline in shares last year he has high hopes for the satellite TV and wireless services provider next year having owned the stock for decades now while the company's traditional satellite video business is a bit of a melting Ice Cube and has taken a hit from cord cutting it still generates large amounts of free cash flow what's more he's particularly excited about the company's wireless network business dish has been spending tens of billions of dollars to acquire Spectrum licenses around the country as it builds out a new 5G Network the next stock picks come from Eric schoenstein at Jensen quality growth fund a 10-year holding of the fund TJX operates Brands like TJ Maxx Marshalls and Home Goods shown cnc's potential for the stock next year calling it a relatively resilient business with defensive characteristics and a strong correlation to consumer spending he thinks that as consumers are more mindful of costs tjx's great deals low prices relative to peers and Customer Loyalty should be beneficial for the stock I'm in an environment where consumers are facing higher rents mortgages and Home Ownership costs TJX stands to benefit from the subsequent trade down effect and bargain Theory as consumers cut back on spending another of schoenstein's top picks is minnesota-based United Health Group the largest managed health care and insurance company in the country which serves roughly 149 million people in a slowing economic environment United Health is not only a defensive play which shares Rising this year While most of the market tanked but also a growth company at the same time he likes the company's resilient business model and ability to generate substantial cash flow with stable earnings growth to limit volatility in the stock over time the next two picks come from Kenneth Kirk at aerial fund he likes Royal Caribbean Cruises which the fund his own shares of for roughly 15 years like the other major Cruise operators Royal Caribbean struggled during the pandemic as lockdowns effectively crippled the industry with fleets under extended no sale orders despite a 37 percent drop in the stock this year Kurt points to significant upside ahead especially as management aims for double-digit earnings powered by 2025. what's more on a comparable basis Cruise pricing is now above pre-pandemic levels while occupancy rates have also rebounded significantly a big part of the story is customer retention he says Kurt also likes zebra Technologies which is a market leader in Enterprise asset intelligence focused on barcode scanning and inventory tracking technology zebra's largest customers include Amazon Target and many others spanning a range of sectors including retail manufacturing health care and transportation he is particularly optimistic about some of zebra's newer Technologies such as radio frequency identification which uses electromagnetic fields to track and identify different objects in transit the next stock picks are from Amy Zhang at Alger mid cap Focus fund she likes Woodlands texas-based waste collection disposal and recycling company Waste Connections which she calls a defensive business that would be resilient in a slowing economic environment in a business less focused on volume growth and more concerned with pricing Waste Connections has a strong track record of industry-leading margins and cash flow she also likes long-term compounder insulate a medical device company focused on treating diabetes patients through its body worn omnipod insulin pump beyond the company's classic omnipod and omnipod dash insulin

small cap software company focused on providing verification and safety for digital brand advertising the company's technology helps Brands and Publishers with viewability by detecting fraud and protecting brand safety through avoiding poor content placement she points out that with markets also incredibly concerned about brand safety with advertising this type of AD spend should preclude the fear of a recession another pick for this year is cloud-based software fintechbuild.com which assists small businesses on accounts payable and receivable the company helps smooth out back office payments and while it was hit by a more challenging economic environment that has been somewhat offset by pricing power and new customer momentum what's more the company is poised to benefit as they move money for clients in a rising rate environment the last two picks come from Kirsty Gibson a Bailey Giffords U.S Equity growth fund one of the fund's more recent additions from mid-2021 is education tech company Duolingo known for its app that teaches languages one of the hardest parts of learning a new language is staying motivated to keep studying particularly if you're not living in that country she points out Duolingo has taken a gamification approach to overcome this challenge since the app is free to use the company has been able to grow organically with relatively low marketing spend allowing for more cash to be deployed toward product development her last pick and also one of Bailey Gifford's largest Holdings is Canadian e-commerce giant Shopify once a pandemic Era stock darling which saw sharers tank more than 70 percent in 2022 she likes what she describes as exciting changes such as the company moving into Enterprise markets and launching Shopify

LESS COMPETITION The fact is, when times are difficult - companies scale back, they fold, they conserve cash, and they play it safe - but, this opens the door for more aggressive, smaller companies to stand out and take their place.   MORE OPPORTUNITY. In a way, a recession is the markets way of ‚ÄúWeeding out the weak,"" giving opportunities to newer, smaller people and businesses to develop.  AFTER EVERY BEAR MARKET‚Ä¶COMES A BULL MARKET.  As Yahoo Finance points out, ‚Äúhistorically, the S&P 500 has fallen an average of 29% around a recession with a median drop of 24%‚Äù - but, once stocks have found their low‚Ä¶the average return the following year is 40%‚Ä¶and, within two years‚Ä¶the market has increased by 58%.   In terms of what to do:   One, Scale Back On Your Expenses. This means that you track your income, cut back on the unnecessary spending, and operate ‚Äúlean‚Äù while you continue re-investing on a regular basis. It should also include a plan to outline what you would do if your income drops 20-50%, how you would make up that difference, and if you can take preventative measures - AHEAD OF TIME, to protect yourself from this happening.    Two, Hold Some Cash.  I‚Äôm a firm believer that, even though your money is statistically BEST OFF invested as soon as possible‚Ä¶there is the peace of mind of having a cash position, at all times, to take advantage of any opportunities that may come up.  Three, Protect your career.  This, at the end of the day, is going to be your BEST HEDGE against whatever happens‚Ä¶after all, your worst case scenario, financially, isn‚Äôt a market going down‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a market that goes down, during a time where you lose your job, and can‚Äôt afford to hold your investments long enough for them to recover. NOW is the time to IMPROVE yourself, learn new skills, double down on everything, and use that your advantage.   Four, ONLY INVEST LONG TERM Generally, it‚Äôs best not to invest any money that you might need in the next 5 years‚Ä¶and, preferably, even longer. The best course is action - when it comes to investing - is not to do anything different, and carry on as usual. Its shown dollar cost averaging, or the practice of buying into the market at regular intervals over the long term - is the most profitable investing strategy. So, stay in the markets‚Ä¶and continue buying in.   And Five, DIVERSIFY YOUR INVESTMENTS.  If you personally can‚Äôt handle a 20% drop in prices without panicking‚Ä¶then, maybe, you‚Äôre invested too aggressively. For instance, if you‚Äôre completely in US tech stocks, look into adding large cap and international stocks into the mix. Or, potentially look into investing in real estate, where rents tend to be a little more stable. The more legs your portfolio has to stand on, the less likely it‚Äôll collapse if one or two of them decline.

the easiest times to increase your net worth dramatically if you know what you're doing after all there's a popular saying that riches are made in recessions and it doesn't take much to realize that we're already beginning to move towards that point just take a look at the headlines today more than 9 out of 10 CEOs are bracing for a recession 97 to CFOs are cutting costs by 10 and JP Morgan warns the stock market Could Fall by another easy 20 from current levels now even though this sounds negative the fact is recessions happen on a regular basis and if used correctly it's possible to set yourself up for the rest of your life through some incredible opportunities and discounts with even Warren Buffett being quoted as saying bad news is an Investor's best friend so let's talk about exactly what's expected to happen throughout these next 12 to 24 months the best benefits that you would be able to take advantage of today and precisely what you can do to make sure you're in the best position to make as much money as possible on today's episode of if you subscribe in the next 15.39 seconds I'll show you this really cute picture of a kitten so thank you guys so much and now with that said let's begin alright so before we talk about the best upcoming opportunities you first need to understand what you're going to be up against and to start we need to talk about a recession generally recessions are accompanied by a significant rise in unemployment a drop in wages a loss in consumer confidence and a decline in values across everything from stocks food energy and services with sometimes long lasting effects throughout the entire world but second along with the recession usually comes a decline in earnings see every quarter companies report the revenue and give guidance on their future outlook but lately they've been cutting forecasts bracing for slow or even negative growth inciting recession risks at the highest Pace in 10 years that leads us to third layoffs when consumers earn less they spend less and when companies see less demand they begin to scale back on their expenses with usually employees being the first to get let go in fact just a quick Google search for Mass layoffs shows you dozens upon dozens of companies who are are all trimming their Workforce and as Bank of America explains the U.S economy will soon start losing 175 000 jobs per month so in terms of what this means for you and your Investments as well as how you could use this information to make you money let's start here with number one stocks as of now all three major indexes are down between 20 and 30 percent with analysts like JP Morgan who believe that we have another 20 to go from current levels however if we take a look throughout history since 1946 the average bear Market drop was close to 30 percent with the most severe having been in 2009 when the S P 500 fell 57 from the peak now once you combine the average with the recession bear markets tend to do even worse with an average drop of 34.8 percent which just for reference right now we're down about 25 all of that is to say that generally the absolute bottom occurs when we see capitulation across investors usually that's a time of the start of the recovery and things begin to bounce back now I'll cover exactly how much you can make from this in the next few minutes but first we we have to talk about number two real estate even though every area is different and some locations might continue to flourish housing declines on a national level are actually incredibly rare in fact as you can see throughout the last 60 years there have only ever been a few times where prices meaningfully fell more than 10 percent but now the general Wall Street consensus is that National housing prices are going to decline seven percent with a worst case decline of 10 to 15 percent should interest rates continue to increase of course every Market is going to be different and according to Moody's Analytics the most vulnerable markets could see upwards of a 25 decline from the peak including parts of Florida Arizona Idaho and Southern California with the decline lasting another 12 to 18 months before bottoming out now in the big picture it's probably not going to make that big of a difference for anybody with a fixed rate mortgage who intends to stay in their property for another five to ten years but for anyone looking to invest or buy a house we may begin to see some deals starting to come on the market which we'll cover shortly because we have to also talk about third cash clearly up until now there's been this mindset that cash is wasting away to inflation but when every other asset is falling in price sometimes cash could be the safest place to store your wealth and you know that's significant when someone like the billionaire Ray dalio admits that cash is no longer trash the truth is many people forget that as recent as 2018 cash was the best performing asset and had you just been saving your money in a high-yield savings account you would have far outpaced the market cash is now becoming such a significant part of the portfolio that even fund managers are holding on to the highest amount of cash since 2001 and Citigroup said that cash is the only asset that investors could use as a recession hatch but as far as what you could do about this to make money and why so many people never take advantage of what's about to come here's what you need to know all right so in terms of why this next recession could be a once in a generation opportunity just to consider this first everything becomes less expensive the way I see it even though one person might think this is a bad time to invest everything is falling 30 percent a wealthy person would see this as an opportunity to be able to buy those exact same companies for a 30 discount Warren Buffett really had the perfect analogy for this he said when hamburger prices go down in price we sing when hamburgers go up in price we weep for most people it's the same thing with everything in life that they're buying except for stocks when stocks go down and you can get more for your money people don't like them anymore so first reframe your belief because a falling Market could work to your advantage the second there's less competition the fact is when times are difficult companies scale back they fold they can serve cash and they play it safe but this opens the door for smaller more aggressive companies to stand out and take their place for example one study across 16 000 companies found that those who continue to advertise increase their value and got more bang for the buck with Positive Growth years after the recession ended the third there's way more opportunity in a way a recession is the Market's method of weeding out the week and Patrick met David made a fantastic comparison a few months ago that the peak of the market cycle is exactly like a forest this means that only the largest most established trees or companies get access to all the resources or in this case sunlight everything at the bottom has a difficult time being able to compete and it's hard to grow but just like natural forest fires our economy has a way of repeatedly clearing out and bankrupting the companies who no longer are able to sustain themselves giving opportunities for newer smaller businesses to continue to develop and fourth after every bear Market comes a bull market as Yahoo finance points out historically the S P 500 has fallen an average of 29 around a recession with a median drop of 24 but once stocks have found their low their average return the following year is 40 percent and within two years the market has increased an average of 58 percent this means that investing in the way down is much more profitable than pulling out of the market and waiting and long term the market is always recovered in every single example so far throughout history and finally fifth you have to act before anyone else knows about it I know it sounds easy to think oh perfect I'll just invest during a recession but the truth is recessions are never confirmed until much much later for example the Great Recession that began in December of 2007 was not officially announced until December of 2008 only a few months before it officially ended the recession before that began in March of 2001 but they didn't call it a recession until November later that year and this continues with about a six to 12 month delay until we actually know we are in a confirmed recession but in terms of what you could do about this to profit number one scale back in your expenses this means that you track your Market cut back on unnecessary spending and operate lien while you continue reinvesting as much as possible back into the market this should also include a plan on what you would do if your income were to drop 20 to 50 percent how you would make up the difference and if you could take preventative measures ahead of time to protect yourself from that happening two hold on to some cash now I'm a firm believer that even though statistically your money is best off invested as soon as possible there is something to be said about the Peace of Mind of having cash on the sidelines just in case of something to fall back on for me cash makes up anywhere between 15 and 20 percent of my portfolio depending on the time of the year but generally this has given me so many opportunities to jump on good deals when I find them and it lets me sleep at night knowing that no matter what happens I have something to fall back on the three protect your career this at the end of the day is going to be your best hedge against whatever happens because financially your worst case scenario is not the market going down but instead it's the market going down at the same time that you lose your job and have to sell off your Investments at the bottom before they have time to recover so now is the best time to improve yourself learn new skills and double down on whatever you're currently doing and after that four invest long term the best course of action when it comes to investing is to Simply carry on as usual and pretend like nothing's happening it's shown that dollar cost averaging or the practice of buying into the markets on a regular basis is the most profitable strategy so stay in the market and continue buying in and five diversify your Investments now if you can't personally handle a 20 drop without panicking and probably a sign that you're invested too aggressively for instance if you're completely in U.S tech stocks then it's probably a good idea to add large caps and international stocks to the mix too or potentially look into investing in real estate or buying REITs for rents tend to be a little bit more stable the more legs your portfolio has to stand on the less likely it's going to collapse should one or two of them fall out although in terms of my own plan throughout the next 12 to 24 months this reminds me when I first began my career in real estate at the very peak of the market in 2008 right before Lehman Brothers collapsed prior to the credit Market freeze into the very very beginning of a 50 stock market decline from the outside looking in I probably picked one of the worst possible times to start a career in an industry that was about to see one of its worst drops in history but I gotta say it was an eye-opening experience to begin working and almost immediately see co-workers in the same office leave their jobs because business dried up overnight however if it wasn't for that I might not be here today because I was one of the few remaining agents in my office who was willing to take on the law lowest worst deals possible just for the sake of gaining any experience I could and today I see I see people in businesses who want to take the risks that the more established companies can't for me I see a lot of value continuing to buy in as usual holding a bit of a cash position on the side potentially starting a new business and buying real estate once the market is flattened this is also a great time to double down on your work take on a side hustle and learn as much as you can because whatever you do today is going to be rewarded many times over by the time the market recovers it's definitely not going to be easy but rest

UCs5wAPodliO0oVxiTD8ruvg,2022-04-02T19:00:58Z,,a5ilc412kxA,Buying Insider Stock Tips on the Dark Web,"Buying Insider Stock Tips on the Dark Web  Zero to Making $100k Per Month at 18 I Biaheza Story: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4XpoPsy8sc  My Dropshipping Course:  https://biahezacourse.com/    This video is no shape or form financial advice, it is strictly intended for entertainment purposes only.",25512.0,611319,1183,i mean you can buy pretty much anything on the dark web right from illegal substances to different identities credit card numbers pretty much any kind of fraud or crime that you can think of so i was thinking you know how people sell their stock picks on the regular internet you pay lambo man on instagram and he's gonna tell you which sneaky stock he's investing into that's gonna get you rich quick most of the time it's some fugazi type of info just your everyday local fake flexors you guys already know the vibe but apparently we can only access like five percent of the whole internet through a regular browser like google chrome or safari the deep dark web is the other 90 and maybe you can start to see where i'm going with this i got the crazy thought of there's a lot of tools being sold for all kinds of white-collar crime on the dark web what if one of those tools is stock picks but given that it's a dark web what if there's straight criminal insider information being leaked on there of publicly traded companies which if people trade based on that that's a surefire way to make millions right so this video we're gonna access and explore the underground shady world of insider trading tips on the dark web [Music] so there's the surface web which again is like 5 10 of the internet and you can access that through a google search then you have the deep web which is a portion of the internet that is hidden from regular users that kind of contains records private data just stuff you wouldn't want indexed on the regular surface web then you have the dark web which is where websites are intentionally hidden from search engines and you can only access them through special browsers that mask your identity and that's where all the sneaky spooky stories and all the legal stuff happens so i actually searched stock trading and the dark web on a regular google search on the surface web to see what kind of stuff would pop up if there's any incidents of this if there's any information or articles about it and after some digging i found an sec press release which the ssc is the united states securities and exchange commission they regulate the stock market and make sure that nothing sneaky is happening let's say a top executive at tesla has some crazy information that they know about the company maybe the person knows that the tesla earnings are terrible before they release so they go to their cousin and say yo tap in buy puts short the tesla stock before the earnings because it's going to go down that's insider information and trading like that is illegal they put you in jail or if the executive themselves trades based on this insider information that's illegal right to jail point is there's a press release from them that went out on july 20 21st titled sec charges the bull with selling insider trading tips on the dark web which i was just mind blown this is exactly what i was curious about basically there's this greek man named apostolis travis who was arrested in peru for perpetrating a fraudulent scheme to sell what he called insider trading tips on the dark web travis claimed that the information he was selling consisted of order book data from a securities firm that was provided to trevias by an employee of the firm travis allegedly sold those tips through one-off sales as well as weekly and monthly subscriptions the bed was selling a monthly subscription for insider stock tips i present to you the netflix for insider trading all your favorite fraudulent stock market tips all in one place and do you think insider info that's kind of a big deal and you can use that to make millions off the stock market pretty easily surely that that kind of information would be pretty expensive well let me tell you i found a copy of the actual sec complaint and there's even some screenshots here of his listing buying my service will i'm assuming he-man said give buying my service will give you an edge by knowing what the big boys are buying or selling 29.95 for one sneaky tip the weekly plan for 99.95 you can get monthly insider stock tips delivered to you for 2.99 so he was apparently selling order book info from some fund which is like what the fund is buying and selling as well as pre-released leaked earning reports of publicly traded companies the complaint says that eventually undercover irs and fbi agents signed up for a service to investigate so they subscribe to his insider trading tips netflix one of said agents signed up for the daily tips i guess they were a little stingy and started receiving these emails which had the ticker symbol of the stock and whether the trade should be a purchase position or a short position now it doesn't really say how profitable or accurate those daily tip emails were or if the information was completely legit but it looks like travis eventually started upselling on his services charging people money for specific earning reports before they released and even looking to trade other people's money on august 1st 2017 at approximately 4 43 a.m pacific time he sent one of the agents this email about illumina's yet to be released earnings saying that the total revenue was going to be 662 million with a diluted earnings per share of 82 cents and nine hours later illumina announced its quarterly earnings during a conference call reporting a revenue of 662 million and a deluded earnings per share of 82 cents and so a day later on august 2nd 2017 illumina's stock price closed at 197 percent per share which was a 14.8 increase from the previous day's closing price so if you traded based off of that information you would have made a ton of money the proof was in the pudding with some of his other stuff like the hedge fund order book tips he was giving out i don't know if you can really prove that but with this you can't really fake guessing the correct numbers of an earnings report before it's released that's clear insider info anyways eventually authorities arrested 30 year old travis and he's currently being prosecuted but the crazy thing is he's not an anomaly there's apparently a whole ecosystem of these groups and services out there and i want in i at least want to check it out the only thing i can't wrap my head around is if this travis guy had real insider info which the sec complaint says that he did why would you sell it for like 30 bucks a tip when you could easily compound an investment portfolio of like a thousand bucks into millions if you have insider information that's legit so i don't know but let's check this out by the way i don't encourage any of this entertainment investigation research purposes only i'm just fascinated by all of it and with this i looked up a tutorial on how to access the dark web which told me i needed to download a vpn service so i did that it turned it on for what apparently was an extra layer of security then i downloaded something called the tor browser which also masks your ip and allows you to access the dark web and with just those two steps i was ready to go i don't know why i'm so nervous about this i've never accessed the dark web this feels mad illegal a little spooky but let's go ahead and start up this tour browser i began my journey on the dark web by visiting the hidden wiki that showed links to a lot of popular websites on the dark web well here i am on the alphabay market looking at a lot of illegal drugs i don't know if i could even show this on youtube wow this is crazy but i'm here for a different reason so let's go ahead and try to search for stocks okay so there's this listing which says how to make 131 grand in 21 days signals courses bots but i don't know it doesn't say anything about insider info just looks like a regular signals group that you could probably buy on the regular web so let's keep digging i ended up going on a couple other marketplaces which offered social security numbers fake passports ids stolen credit cards all at the click of a button oh this is a different scheme you can invest into it's not even a scheme per se or rather an operation you can invest into which is illegal bitcoin mining using stolen electricity and they're offering 50 returns per month for 18 months this got to be some sort of fbi website there's no way this is real hear me out a crypto pump campaign i guess you deposit money into this website and they're gonna use your money to run crypto pump and dumps yeah me fair enough so none of the marketplaces i found really offered anything solid related to stocks or trading or investing so i dug deeper started going through search engines on the dark web and eventually stumbled upon this okay i think we might have actually found something the stock insiders the only insider trading community on the dark web wow okay give it to me baby where where is the price of apple gonna go where do i look whoa this is nuts i just clicked on a section that says how to get paid for my insider info and it says that if you have a major announcement that's going to cause at least a 15 shift in the stock price they'll pay you up to 25 000 for your tip this is crazy so if you submit insider info about a listed stock on one of these exchanges at least one day before that info goes public for a minor announcement that's gonna ship the price at least four percent they'll pay up to five grand if it shifts the price at least seven percent ten grand and again if it's a major announcement they'll pay up to 25 000 okay i'm only clicking this for research purposes only but i'm about to press the how to get a full membership button i'm putting it out there research purposes only man i guess we can get into this because in order to join this group you apparently have to provide some insider information that needs to be true in order to be accepted man stop playing with me what so i guess this is sort of like a sneaky club where people exchange insider information or again if you're just interested in selling it they'll apparently buy it off of you and they're always being salesy about convincing people to sell them information suppose you send us quarterly results you can earn up to a hundred thousand per year just for that not bad for just a few hours of work huh so i couldn't access this insider's website but i also found websites that track stock market trades from politicians and executives at publicly traded companies which is kind of crazy but you can find that on the regular web it's not illegal because they're required by law to publish this info man i'm so curious if this is like a trap made by the cia to find out who's trying to sell their insider information or if this is really an underground insider trading range either way it's crazy that it exists if you have a friend uncle brother sister family member friend working at a publicly traded company and they have insider information make sure you drop that in the comment section below wait i'm just kidding don't i'm not soliciting insider information that was a joke stop typing hope you guys enjoyed this video and have an amazing rest of your day peace

What I wanna do here is share with you some basic day trading tips, and really just trading tips in general because this philosophy carries through no matter what you're trading. Now sure I use it for stocks, but even if you're doing futures or Forex or cryptocurrency, I mean this principle still applies. And right off the get go I wanna respect your time, if you are here searching for some sort of mind blowing secret little gem, you're not gonna get that. What I'm gonna talk about here is very very obvious, but in the world of trading and if you have any experience trading you know exactly what I mean when I say this, sometimes the most obvious things are the hardest things to actually do, and it's just because of the way our human mind is working. So at the core, the best time, when I know to buy and the way I want you to approach this in terms of okay, when do I actually buy a stock? When is it smart to be buying a stock? When do I think I have the best chance to make money from the stock, not when it's going up. I get it, that sounds kind of bazaar, but yes I'm telling you if a stock is going up, do not buy. That is not the time to buy. Now that, there comes with a couple little nooks and crannies which I'm gonna explain here. But what do I mean? Well we have stock ABC, I know I got super creative with that name. And it's doing this. What I am telling you is the time to buy, how I know when to buy is not right there, is not right there, is not right there or not right there. No you're rightfully saying, I'm assuming but Clay, had you bought right there you would've made money. Had you bought right there you'd have made money. Bought right there you would have made money. Clay, that's how you make money, that's when you're supposed to buy a stock, when things are going down. I pulled a little mind trick on you though. What did I do? Well I gave you, I gave you total hindsight. You knew what the price was gonna be doing at that time. So of course it's easy to say you should've bought there, and you should've bought there and you should've bought there because I showed you what happened. And that's why books don't work, because books always just show you a picture and the book shows you everything that's already happened, so you have this confirmation bias. And what I did to you is I gave you the confirmation bias of showing you that well yeah, the price just goes up. So of course buying right there or buying right there. But in the real world of trading, this is how it appears. So we have ABC once again, and what you're gonna see is price goes up. So yeah, it's going up. But I don't know, do you buy right there? Well if you're saying no, the proper answer is no, you absolutely don't buy right there. You don't buy when stocks are going up. Why though? Because at this moment in time, there's really no way to manage risk. I mean it's very very hard to figure out okay where would I put a stop loss at? What would my risk actually be? Now I suppose you could say well Clay, I'm gonna put my stop loss, actually, let me make this bigger so you can actually see what I'm actually, so I'm gonna make this so that's what that's representing. Now you could say well Clay, I'm gonna buy right there and I'll put my stop down there. And don't get me wrong, that's great, you're putting a stop loss in, but I mean look at all that. All that risk, I mean you're taking on quite a bit of risk there if you're just gonna put it all the way down there. And all it takes is for a couple of these to all of the sudden, I mean have you ever bought the top before? I mean I've bought the top before. But all it takes is for you to buy a couple of these tops and have it roll back over and take you out, and that's gonna be maybe, maybe a 50% overall win rate because for what you would have to get from a rewards standpoint in order to justify taking that risk, it's gonna be a very very difficult strategy to use. And sorry but there is more to trading than just finding a stock that's skyrocketing and just buying, and then putting the stop down below some area way way far below. All right Clay fine, I see what you mean, you don't wanna buy stocks when they're going up. So when do you buy them? When they're either going down or sideways, because as soon as a stock begins to move downwards, let me try a different color here. At least at that point you no longer have to worry about the dreaded C word of chasing. I've done videos on this time and time again, chasing will get you destroyed. And the reason chasing gets you destroyed is because the risk is so far off like we talked about. Now most people that are chasing, they probably don't even know what stop losses are. But even if you do know what a stop loss is, and you do apply stop losses, the risk is just still too big. So all it takes is a couple of those to wipe out a whole lot of wins. Now of course you could get a big winner where it just keeps on going and going and going, but like I said, that's not gonna be a sustainable strategy over the long haul. But as soon as this happens right here, the price goes down, that's when I know it's time to buy. Now not, I don't mean it in the sense of a price goes down and I just buy, but my point is that's when I know to start to get interested to buy. Or not necessarily down, maybe the price just starts to go sideways. Well at least at that point in time, okay, I'm not chasing, the price is at least starting to go sideways. And the reason why you should be interested when stock prices are either going down or sideways is because at that point managing risk, putting a trade plan together becomes that much more attractive. It becomes that much more risk-friendly. And that way you are gonna put yourself in the position, or even if you do take several losses, at least the losses aren't something like this where you're getting out way down here. You're gonna have a much better idea of where you should be putting stop losses, and those locations of the stop loss, you know the risk is gonna be dramatically reduced. Of course you always have the actually risk of losing, but the dollar amount associated with that loss will be much much less compared to just simply chasing the price and buying because hey it's going up, it's going up. Now the idea here is yes, you do wanna buy stocks when they go up. But you wanna find those areas within the trend where it's taking a breath. And when stocks take breaths, when stocks look like they're pulling back, well you know what, that's gonna give yourself a better odds over the long haul of being able to keep account growth going. Because sure, you can still lose, but it's not gonna be a situation where you just take some big old loss because things just plummet and plummet and plummet, but you also need to be careful because I get it, and it's a good point if you're thinking it, but Clay I mean, that sounds crazy. You wait for a stock to go down before you get interested? I mean what happens if that right there is the start of a big old reversal? Well that's fine, my point to you would be if it is a reversal, would you rather be buying the reversal right there or would you rather be buying the reversal right there? I mean who is gonna take a bigger beating? Well of course the person that bought up there right? Because they just got in way higher than the person that actually waited for it to pull back. So absolutely, a pullback can turn into a reversal, I'm not refuting that, I'm not saying this is the holy grail. But my point is just strictly from a risk perspective, the people that do wait for things to pull back, to cool off a little bit, people that do wait for it to at least go sideways, it becomes a lot easier to see where your risk should be, see where your stop loss should be, and yeah you could still lose money but not nearly as bad as those people that chased the stock. So that is where, that is really the core foundation to any sort of trade plan is you need to know when to at least get interested in a stock. And as counter-intuitive as it is, when a stock price is just going straight up, that's not the time to be interested. Now of course you could be interested in the sense of okay, I wanna watch it, but you should not be interested in the sense of I'm ready to buy. No, watch, and then wait and you need to wait for it to pull back. And it can be very difficult, because again, going back to this, you could be watching, and then it gets there, oh crap, I'm waiting for this thing to pull back. Oh my goodness, I could have bought right there and it still hasn't pulled back. And then oh man I, and that can get you in trouble. In fact, I'll put a link down below where I talk about the whole psychology of what's going on in this event. But I will say this, if you're watching something and you're waiting for a pullback and waiting for a pullback and waiting for a pullback and it just keeps going straight up, you're doing it the right way, well done. Sure there's people that are chasing and they're being rewarded for chasing, but all it takes is one where they buy the top, it reverses around, and let's face it, those people aren't using stop losses, and then it just keeps going down and down and down, and then all those times where they did buy and chase and had wins, they're all wiped away. I mean I've been doing this since 2013, working with traders, I've heard this story over and over again, I did it, if you're honest with yourself you probably did something like that too. So don't be frustrated. It's easy to get frustrated when you're just watching something go up and up and up, and you're sitting here, you're waiting for the pullback, you're waiting for that pullback, come on just give me a chance, let me manage my risk a little bit better. And it just keeps going up. The temptation is very real to buy, but don't do it. That's when you should not be buying stocks. So how do I know when? How should you know when to buy a stock? When it either pulls back or at least starts to go sideways. Sounds backwards, I get it, be interested, know when to buy a stock because it's going down? Yes, absolutely, and you wanna make sure you're doing this and approaching trading in a very risk aware type of way, and by waiting for these little simple things that's gonna be the linchpin that allows you to start to build on top of that a good quality risk based trade plan, and that's what trading is all about. So if you found this video helpful, like I said, I know it wasn't anything like mind blowing, but it's the little things that make all the difference.

But thanks for hanging out, and get out there, and remember you should be interested in buying a stock when it's going down. First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video. Real quick, before you go, I wanna invite you to a live webinar, web class, training, workshop, online event, whatever you wanna call it. But it will be me, live, revealing to you what I've discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss. Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total. I'm gonna cover three keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets. The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way. The second key is super awesome, because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use. But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders, I'll explain it all though including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some. And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works. Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is, again, totally live. Even if you can't make the live session please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you. Click the image on the screen, or click the link down in the description box you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event. If you have any questions, let me know. If not, I'll be seeing you soon."

]",1891.0,14954,202,hey what's up Good People how you doing uh for those of you that don't know I'm Larry Jones um this is the page known as stock up with Larry Jones and we are the family all all 500 and almost 90 000 of us hey for those of you that are new welcome to the page uh I know that there's been a lot of new subscribers here in the last month welcome aboard we're gonna just briefly go over uh last week and what we're expecting this week and then I'm gonna have a little inspiration at the end because that's what we do here in stock over Larry Jones okay so just bear with the inspiration uh but uh last week we saw that we had a lot of volatility in the market especially on Friday we saw the intraday moves especially with the Dow by hundreds of points and um a lot ask the reason why and there's a variant of things we know that there's tensions there's geopolitical situations but for what I see it the biggest fear is uh CPI which is Consumer Price Index it measures um uh the rate of change of goods and services that you and I um consume that's why it's called the Consumer Price Index CPI okay and um if it comes in high that means inflation is rearing its ugly head back up if that comes in high and it shows that inflation is rearing its ugly head back up that means that the FED fed your own power who's the fair chair will be more hawkish and that term means that he's going to be more aggressive in raising interest rate hikes his number one job right now because of the data that we've been getting is to kill jobs to kill jobs and he has this Balancing Act where he's trying to kill jobs without causing a deeper recession well I got news for you that is very very difficult now it's not 100 out of the question there is a small chance that it still could happen but he's not worried and he said it time and time again about causing us to go into a deeper recession because he could literally literally just start printing more money and do what's called a quantitative easing okay so that's what's happening with the market so this coming week will be very volatile with CPI coming on Tuesday which is Valentine's Day question is will it show us some love excuse me I got a call coming on I'm not going to edit this out a sneeze rather got these allergies and so what we're going to do is we're going to monitor it and keep our eye on day by day and week by week so now in the micro short term it shows that there's still room for bullishness I want excuse me I want you guys to keep your eyes on specific stock right let's let's look at what the Super Bowl shows us in ads okay so now I went to a charity event I'm going to talk to you guys about a little later um before the Chicago Auto Show opened up so you you get to go there a day before it's a black tie event and uh I'll I'll on Monday's video I'll show you guys some footage I'm gonna tell you keep your eye out for these GM commercials General Motors and I know everybody is chasing Tesla Tesla's Tesla for the EVS but I'm going to tell you GM has so many EVS that are coming out and I can just tell you right now the trucks I'm not even a truck guy you know the big like F-150s with the beds that was there too but GM has so many electric vehicles coming out and I'm just I'm just telling you some of these vehicles I I wouldn't take a second look at Tesla the car itself not the stock right so GM is a company that's been around for a while so it's a legacy car maker but if they keep moving in the space that they are we'll discuss that more on Monday man I'm telling you it's it's some game changers out there so not just cars and EVS let's look at if there's anything that the Super Bowl shows us in the way of advertising that could cause a stock or a sector to be hot on Monday okay so that's how we're gonna look on today's video I want you to tell me what do you see coming uh this coming week what stock do you think will run up uh are you playing the cues the tqq or the sqq are you playing those um are you expecting it to go up playing a tqq which means T for tall just think about that something I made up and S for short going down so you let me know in the comment section what you plan on doing um um I'm not going to play any of the cues because I don't have to I had a killer month uh and you know over the last three days so now I'm taking my Star Quarterback out but I'm gonna be looking for other plays okay but I want to hear from you what you are going to be looking at remember anything I say is not a suggestion for you to buy wholesale um I do if you're doing options I do expect that Tesla will start to run again it's cooling off it will probably start to have a bounce up into investors day okay a Tesla and um you know if you're doing the bathroom or sell the news meaning you're going to buy it short term run it up to and sell it before uh that's something that's a play that I may get back into but I'm going to be very very cautious and I'm not going to invest with the same amount of money that I just won off of Tesla that is my rule if I win big I only invest a third of the amount now I know on yesterday's video I did a little more but I was trying to teach a lesson okay um I got out made a little money I could have made much more but I want you guys to learn right so now let's switch to the inspiration now today you're going to see well let me let me bag up I want to say this for those of you that don't understand why church people our soul gets so excited and get so loud and get so boisterous and they dance and they shout and I know a lot of you guys make fun of that but let me explain something um years ago I took a friend of mine's to a church with me uh uh Italian gentleman that grew up Catholic I took him to church with me and yeah they was you know it was like The Blues Brothers and he was like why are they why are they so you know I was taught you you be quiet in church and I said listen you don't know what that woman just went through you don't know that she was suffering from an illness and the doctor just gave her a clean bill of health right you don't know that somebody just lost their job and they just got another job and how thankful they are you may think you had a hard time but there's always somebody that has a rougher time than you do and so they're simply saying thank you so I want you to watch the Super Bowl today right and just think if they was rooting for God or just think if they were rooting for our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I'm a Christian Unapologetic unapologetically okay but I want you to watch you're going to see grown men that never saw each other turn around giving high fives you're gonna see people painting stuff on there and I'm too I'm gonna watch the game ain't no wrong with it I'm gonna watch the game I'm gonna be rooting you know go Chiefs but I'm gonna be rooting for my team right and I'm not a big football fan but I do watch the Super Bowl but I want you to watch the exuberance listen to the announcer just think he's a preacher and he's going to be oh my look at that all this exuberant we want to do that but when we wanna when when others take that same exuberance to say thank you you want everybody to be quiet so I just want you to rethink about the way you've been thinking and I want you to take the time I want you to video yourself and your reactions when the touchdown comes or when you're cute your quarterback does his job or when somebody your offense or whatever brings you excitement whether it's the half time I want you to think about how much or how thankful you are for your team but I want you to convert that to being thankful to our creator because he's allowed all of this to happen for you and for me that's my inspiration today all right so on Monday if I go live Monday morning we're going to talk about how exuberant everybody was about the game and why can't we be that thankful for our Creator God who allows us to do all of this I just went to a funeral uh of a billionaire he's less than the one percent of a billionaire the owner of the Cubs was there and I'll talk about that later I went to a memorial service it wasn't a funeral and uh he's so he was so unlike most billionaires because he touched a lot of lives so we want to talk about that a little later I want to keep this one short so enjoy the game but also take some time on this Sunday to say thank you to your God as much as you say thank you to your team okay that's my inspiration for the day we'll see you guys Monday morning probably live make sure you got that subscription Bill selected and make sure you download uh Weeble and MooMoo all right Weeble and MooMoo so tomorrow will be moo moo Monday and uh get your free stock you want to guaranteed five free stock by depositing 100 and then we're gonna go from there okay all right and we're gonna talk about Google because I got my eye on Google listen that's a whole nother conversation everybody's you know writing Google off because they had a debacle that's nothing if you go to the Auto Show and see what these Legacy card dealers these Legacy car manufacturers are doing Tesla took off and these Legacy car companies have the technology they just waited same thing with Google good people Google had uh uh the technology for AI they've been working on it for a while they just called somebody that they for them to rush and make a big mistake but I make more money on the red stock when I see opportunity I go in and I pounce when others have fear that's when I run towards the burning building to catch the Fallen baby hey I apologize for the echo uh on my way to church here I'll see you guys later enjoy the game live love laugh and learn

guys saw from my last video once again it is 13f season so in this video we're going to be looking at the five most bought Stocks by our 77 super investors in q1 of 2023 as of course tracked by Dart Aroma now before we get started right at the top of the video I do just want to say that with videos like these please remember that these five businesses are not stock recommendations they don't create a shopping list for us as value investors remember like I always say this is just an ideas list for us to potentially explore further in our own time but with that said let's Roll that list up on screen and let's have a bit of a look at which stocks are taking our super investors fancy in q1 of 2023. foreign and we start with the fifth most bought stock by our super investors in q1 it was Intuit so overall we saw seven super investors Buy in during the quarter so what do they do well Intuit is a provider of financial management software to small and medium-sized businesses but you'll probably recognize them more from the brands that they own Turbo Tax Credit Karma QuickBooks and MailChimp they divide themselves up into four key Revenue segments although the business is really carried by two of them that being small business and self-employed which is QuickBooks and MailChimp and consumer which is Turbo Tax so accounting software for small business and tax return help for consumers and combined these segments make up about 80 percent of their revenue and the bulk of their segment operating income too so clearly the super investors see something in this space but honestly I'm not sure I quite understand the thesis because to me it seems like the business faces more macroeconomic headwinds than Tailwinds over the next few years Rising interest rates will obviously hurt most parts of business but particularly will hit their Credit Karma business and if unemployment starts to rise that will only hurt their Turbo Tax business even the IRS itself is currently reporting a declining number of filed tax returns year over year after they saw that huge pandemic surge of 10 million extra filed returns as the prior year tax returns were the determinant of the size of your stimulus check so there are some headwinds the business definitely needs to overcome but hey maybe it's just ridiculously cheap well I should say that I don't know this business intimately but on face value it certainly doesn't look at the stock is down since the end of 2021 when they completed the MailChimp acquisition but it does still sit around 415 dollars per share which gives it a PE ratio of about 60. so while it looked tasty for seven of our super investors I personally can't say I'm convinced straight off the bat so please if you guys have any more context on this business definitely let me know down in the comment section below but then moving on to the fourth most bought stock by our super investors in q1 we arrive at a bit of a controversial name and that is Meta Meta has obviously come under a lot of pressure across the past few years with their massive spending on metaverse development but also from the reduction in profitability of their advertising Apple has reduced the effectiveness of AD targeting on their devices the macroeconomic environment has caused many advertisers to pull back on their marketing budgets and then on top of that you also have the third big issue of short form video being notoriously difficult to monetize so just like that all of a sudden you've got quite a few tough headwinds for meta and these are headwinds that are still ongoing today it was this combination of factors that killed the stock about 70 between its high in 2021 and it's low in 2022 but what's been crazy is the stocks come back in 2023 since that low in November of 2022 metashares have gained approximately 180 percent so really impressive timing by our super investors on this one and it seems at least in recent times there does actually seem to be some positive news now coming out of the company that investors can cheer about in their most recent quarterly earnings they post their first year-over-year sales increase in four quarters revenue is up three percent year over year however to keep that in perspective costs did rise quite substantially as well so overall operating income is still 15 lower year over year leading to their operating margin falling from 31 to 25 year over year but their work limits of improvement and they did Issue optimistic guidance as well with second quarter Revenue expected to be between 29 and a half and 32 billion dollars now the interesting thing is if you just take that lower figure that would still represent two percent Revenue growth year over year so investors are going from extreme pessimism where Revenue isn't going anywhere to now a glimmer of optimism as they could see two consecutive quarters of year-over-year Revenue growth and as Peter Lynch says you don't necessarily need to be in a stock when it goes from good to great you can just find find those turnarounds that go from crappy to semi-crappy and usually the institutional money will swing the stock back around so a very interesting time for meta but usually this one is a feature in the most bought stocks buyer super investors so clearly the smart money are very confident in this business for the long run so overall that is meta and then coming in at number three we have Microsoft Microsoft was bought by nine of our super investors in q1 and there's no doubt they've continued to ride the wave of AI over the past few months in fact since chat gpt's release in November of 2022 Microsoft stock is now up about 40 percent now while it's true that open AI you know the people behind chat are not owned by Microsoft Microsoft is a significant shareholder in that business originally Microsoft signed a one billion dollar deal with open AI back in 2019 becoming open ai's exclusive technology partner and then earlier in this year they extended that partnership with a further 10 billion investment which prompted openai co-founder Elon Musk to practically admit the open AI are effectively controlled by Microsoft at this point and while the success of chat GPT hasn't meaningfully impacted Microsoft's Financial results the market is already jumping on board and pricing the future of AI into Microsoft stock and interestingly these developments have also prompted Bill Gates to get back into the stock holding it for his foundation it's now his biggest position in the portfolio and a little bit of extra anecdotal evidence when I was talking to Monash per Bri Mona should actually just sat down with a dinner with Bill Gates where Bill City thinks Microsoft actually has an Unstoppable lead in AI so a very interesting anecdote but of course nothing that we as value investors should necessarily be reading too much into what we should be more focused on of course is their core business because remember at its heart Microsoft has numerous software businesses which have gotten it to where it is today and with these core pieces of software usually you can find some pretty powerful switching modes from Windows to Office 365 to azure Xbox's Game Pass LinkedIn OneDrive Microsoft teams and so on it's these pieces of software that lock customers into giving Microsoft cash quarter after quarter and while AI is the hip new thing I'm sure that for the super investors it was likely the strength of their Core Business that made them want to buy in okay and with that said now we move on to the second most bought stock which was Amazon so Amazon was bought by 13 of our super investors and if I show you a picture of their stock chart I think you'll understand why over the last six months or so the stock has basically been reset 2020 levels due to their business suffering at the hands of the macro economic environment see over the last few years Amazon has really focused on expanding capacity to increase their revenue and their profitability but of course with this inflation we've seen right now their costs are rising equally as quickly their costs of goods sold are rising operating expenses are rising and ultimately for Amazon earnings are suffering however many value investors is the betting that while they're going through some short-term pain at the moment this period of investment will ultimately set them up for long-term gain as this is a trend we've seen for decades with Amazon money's probably among others is quick to use Amazon as an example of exceptional Capital allocation and you can see from this chart thanks to my buddies Brad and David that Amazon will not stop investing into growing their company as you can see while Alibaba and Google and meta and apple are generating cash and they're just sticking it on the pile 10 cent and Amazon are the only two on the list that are taking their money plus some and putting it back into growth Avenues within the business now businesses don't just do this willy-nilly so a table like this really shows you the companies that genuinely believe that they have something worth investing in so that's the story with Amazon and now finally we get to our most bought stock in q1 of 2023 and it is Google Now Google usually features around the number one two or three spot in this list each quarter and it's really not hard to see why despite advertisers pulling back on marketing budgets over the past year or so Google has been able to hold Revenue fairly steady and with their Cloud business still Gathering the momentum plus the amazing cushion that is their balance sheet I think the super investors are saying that this is just a money printing business that even during a recession doesn't even really go backwards they obviously have a very strong moat in internet search and that actually protects them better than a company like meta as no device manufacturer can really mess around with them you know devices are reliant on Google as opposed to a company like meta that is reliant on devices pretty much everyone uses Google and there isn't even a close second which puts Google in a very strong competitive position the moat is very powerful and it protects their cash flows even in a tough macro environment for example over the past four quarters their free cash flow has just consistently improved despite all that's been happening in terms of the economy and then on top of that you also have a company that has 115 billion in cash or short-term marketable securities and only 108 billion in total liabilities so that plus their moat plus their profitability plus the fact that the business traded around ninety dollars per share in q1 is most likely the combination of factors that had so many super investors buying the stock over the past few quarters but with that said guys they are the top five buys from the super investors in q1 of 2023 let me know what you think and let me know if any of these businesses actually feature in your portfolios I would love to hear any further opinions on these stocks down in the comment section below but guys

sell at silly prices from time to time it doesn't take a high IQ to figure out that they're cheap but it does take a temperament that's willing to step up and actually act that day as I'm sure you are all aware is Mr Warren Buffett the 92 year old Oracle of Omaha he is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway one of the largest companies in the world and the reason most people know his name is because he is the world's best investor every year he releases a letter to his shareholders where he details the returns of Berkshire Hathaway stock since he took the reins back in 1965 and get this from then to now he's averaged 20.1 per year while the S P 500 or the market has only averaged ten and a half percent berkshire's Total return over that time is 3.6 million percent versus thirty thousand percent of the s p 500. so in this video we're going to take the time to hear some of Warren Buffett's advice that specifically applies to the the investing scenario that we all face coming into 2023. so what is that situation well firstly the market is falling it felt 20 in 2022 we also have very high inflation although thankfully that does seem to be trending down at least currently and then finally we have Rising interest rates which are likely going to continue in 2023 based on the FED reaffirming they want to get that inflation rate back down to two percent and they won't stop raising rates until they get there so Chuck that all together with the possibility of a decent sized recession throughout the year and well for investors there's a lot to think about so let's start at the start the first conundrum what do we do as rational long-term value investors when the stock market is pretty solidly trending down let's talk a little bit about the fact that the Market's down almost 800 points this morning yeah concern for you well no that's good for us actually I mean we're a net buyer of stocks over time and uh just like being in that buyer of food I expect to buy food the rest of my life and I hope that food goes down at price tomorrow when stocks are down we're going to be buying on balance and who wouldn't rather buy it you know a lower price at a higher price people are really strange on that I mean they uh because most people most most your listeners are Savers and that means they'll beat up buyers and they should want the stock market to go down they should want to buy at a lower price and they have that feeling that they just feel better when stocks are going up Buffett's rational thinking really shines through in this clip if you're a long-term investor trying to build wealth and you're under the age of about you know 55 you actually want the stock market to go down reason being is you should still be a net buyer of stocks you know if you're 70 or if you're 80 then you definitely want the stock market to stay really high because on the flip side chances are you're in the stage of your life where you're a net seller of stocks and I like that Buffett touches on the fact that most people's reaction to a falling Market is really emotional people just feel better buying stocks when the market is going up but in reality you should actually actually feel better buying at times like right now when the stock market is down so much and this goes back to a very famous investing quote which says the stock market is the only place people run out of the store during a sale think about that when it's Black Friday we're always buying but how come we get scared when Black Friday happens in the stock market for long-term investors we should actually get excited by the stock market falling have a listen to these two clips some people should note on sites at all because they just get too upset with price fluctuations if you're going to do dumb things because your stock a stock goes down you shouldn't own a stock at all what I've done things selling a stuff selling stock else it goes down I mean if you buy your house at twenty thousand dollars and somebody comes along next day and says I'll pay you 15 you don't sell it because the course is 15. but some people are not actually emotionally or psychologically fit to own stocks but I think there are more of them would be if you get educated now on what you're really buying which is part of a business if you worry about corrections you shouldn't own stocks I mean if you can't take your stock going now it's going to go down sometime if you own a stock so why worry about it I mean the point is to buy something that you like at a price you like and then hold it for 20 years and you should not look at it day to day if you bought a farm or apartment hush you wouldn't get a quote on it every day or every week or every month so it's a terrible mistake to think of stocks as something that bob up and down into you should pay attention to Wells Bobs up and down so in summary own great businesses and remember that market Corrections are a normal part of investing and they should actually make you happy not scared so that's investing during a bear Market but what about all this inflation we're seeing prices of materials are rising a lot at the moment making everything more expensive for both us consumers and also for businesses so what do we need to consider during a period where prices across the board are inflating Keane said it many years ago that it's an invisible tax that only one man and a million really understands the best investment against inflation is to improve your own earning power the best passive investment I think is is a good business if you own an interest in a good business uh you're very likely to maintain purchasing power no matter what happens to the currency but it's interesting in the United States the value of the dollar since I was born is declined by 94 percent to six cents but things can work out pretty well even during inflationary times I mean if somebody told me when I was born you know the dollar bill is going to go to six cents I might have said you know let me go back I'm not I'm not interested in emerging into that kind of a world but actually it's worked out pretty well so I have no complaints so that advice is really interesting there are a few Concepts to unpack there firstly the best thing you can do during High inflation is to actually improve your own earning power okay make yourself more valuable to your employer or potential future employers so that your income can actually rise alongside the inflation that you'll feel but beyond that Buffett says the best passive strategy you can Implement to nullify inflation is to find a really high quality business and stay invested in it and Buffett wrote down exactly what he meant by this back in his 1981 shareholder letter he said that the best businesses to own to combat inflation have firstly an ability to increase prices rather easily even when product demand is flat and capacity is not fully utilized without fear of significant loss of either market share or unit volume and then two he said they need to have an ability to accommodate large dollar volume increases in business often produced more by inflation than by real growth with only minor additional investment of capital so to explain the second Point first Buffett is simply saying that businesses will fare better during inflation if they are scalable AKA they can accommodate a much higher dollar volume of business without needing to sink a lot of money into the company to increase that capacity think for example a social media company versus a car company you know it costs Facebook next to nothing really to show you three ads instead of two but for Ford or for Tesla to increase their output by 50 percent well that would cost a lot in capex and it will take a lot of time to spin up so that's the second point but it's Buffett's first point that is really critical when it comes to investing during inflation and that is that the business needs to have an ability to increase prices with without losing market share or unit volume and this simply means that the company has a competitive advantage or a moat that gives them pricing power when you go into a drugstore 7-Eleven or something and you say I would like a Snickers bar and the owner says oh I've got something the mosque bar at at 10 cents off the Snickers bar you say give me the stickers and if he doesn't give you the Snickers you go across the street and buy the stickers it's probably easier to develop a new car this compete with stickers but some products have terrific models in them probably Elmer's Glue does you know WD-40 people that have an iPhone they want to continue with the product that they've got they want they want the new version it's just easier for them they've learned how to do everything and their life's built around it and all of that and mulch are very useful Costco has a mold in people's mind I mean Amazon can raise the price of prime you know 20 and you can't do that unless you've built something within that image of the Amazon on Prime that's based on reality that you're going to get a lot for your money and you're going to want to use it and then you can raise prices twenty dollars but if you're selling you know if you're selling some commodity problem a product you can't do that you need a mode so there are many different types of modes out there for example a patent could give a company a moat anytime you have to pay a toll that toll collecting company has a moat as Buffett said powerful Brands like Coca-Cola or apple or Louis Vuitton they all have moats Costco's built a motor around always having the best prices there are a lot of different ways companies can form a competitive advantage and if it gives them the ability to dictate prices AKA pricing power then they're the best bets to come out on top during an inflationary period as inflation raises their costs and lowers their profits they can simply raise the prices of their end products and their moats should protect them from suffering a drop in sales in fact last year as Coca-Cola raised their prices their sales actually went up so there's some good proof for you so that's how to handle the inflation side of investing in 2023 but finally we also need to talk about the third Big Challenge of investing this year interest rates what can we do when interest rates just keep Rising interest rates you know basically are to uh the value of assets what gravity is to matter you know essentially and if if I could reduce gravity it's pulled by about 80 percent I mean I'd be in the Tokyo Olympics jumping that's really the way to view interest rates like gravity to the stock market when interest rates are very low it makes money cheap and easy to access for both consumers and businesses and this means more spending more profits and more growth and that's what we've had basically over the past 10 years or so but now on the flip side we're starting to see Rising interest rates this means of course borrowed money is more expensive to access so business debts become harder to pay off and consumers generally have a lot less to spend so this is a tough environment for businesses to operate and thrive in and often shows in their financial results which then affect their stock prices have a look at this graphic of the past five years as you can see interest rates went up in 28 18 and the stock market didn't do much at all in 2019 rates started coming down and the market went up and then when covert struck the FED lowered the interest rate to zero and the market basically boomed for two years however in 2022 interest rates went up a lot and the market dropped by 20 so when rates go up stocks generally suffer and this is half caused by businesses performing poorly and their stock value falling but the other factor to consider with interest rates is of course government bonds so U.S treasury bills or treasury bonds are generally considered the risk-free returns so you give the US Treasury a loan and then they'll pay you back at some point in the future plus interest so when interest rates are low the government honestly they give you bugger all interest but when interest rates rise if you buy the new bonds that they're issuing well those ones will give you a higher interest payment now this is all very boring to us but it is very interesting to the 80 of the market who are just Institution money managers trying to get a good return for their clients with as little risk as possible so what you find is that when rates rise a lot of professional money flows out of the risky stock market and back into the safety of treasury bills and that's selling out of the stock market by the big players causes stock prices to fall this is Buffett talking about exactly this idea in 1982 or three when the long government got to 15 a company that was earning 15 on Equity was no more than Book value under those circumstances because you could buy a 30-year strip of bonds and guarantee yourself for 15 a year and a business that earned 12 percent was a subpar business then but a business that earns 12 percent when the Government Bond is three percent is one hell of a business now and that's why they solve a very fancy prices so if a business is giving you 10 Returns per year that's pretty good but the closer that risk-free rate gets to 10 the more professional money will sell the business and just buy the Government Bond causing the businesses stock price price to fall so what do we take away from all this well it's again that we need to be laser focused on our selected businesses performance and we need to stay focused on the long term because history tells us stocks are generally a better place to be than bonds over a very long period of time that's just the reality but for short periods of time well occasionally they're not so we as stock market investors need to stay focused on the long term so that we can use the depressed stock prices on high quality businesses as opportunities for long-term returns we need to acknowledge that we can't do anything about the Federal Reserve they'll do whatever so instead let's just play the long game and pick up great businesses at great prices while interest rates are really high that's how we tackle a high interest rate environment and overall guys that is Warren Buffett's wisdom around tackling the three big investing issues that we are all going to face in 2023 stock market correction High inflation and Rising interest rates but really

So it‚Äôs time to learn how money works and find out why you probably shouldn‚Äôt be learning to work your money like these popular youtubers might suggest. Now I want to preface this by saying that I personally enjoy watching people like Graham Stephan, Andre Jink, and from time to time even dave ramsey (as a guilty pleasure). None of these guys are outright nefarious scammers like the hustle bros you will see pitching an amazon automation course and this automatically makes them a million times better than this other group. What‚Äôs more is that they are genuinely entertaining, they give people a sneak peek into their own success while presenting relatively dry content in a way that is funny and easy to understand. The problem is though. Personal Finance should be boring. There is a common saying that everything you need to know about personal finance should be able to fit on a postcard, some authors have actually done it. But when you are committing to an upload schedule of a 15 minute video every single day of every single week you are going to run out of things on that post card to talk about. Now this is no good, because as these people will show you, they make millions of dollars a year from their daily video‚Äôs so they are not exactly going to turn around and say ‚Äúoh well I have taught you everything you need to know now‚Ä¶ so long and thanks for all the fish‚Äù Of course not that would be silly‚Ä¶ and I am sure any one of us that is in there position would do the same thing that they are, which is riding that damn gravy train for as long as they can. But to do this they need to create more content than what this posted note can provide so they branch out into a few different broad categories. Personal Stories About Their Success Reactions Predictions And making up new lessons Now to start off with lets look at the least problematic of these formats, reaction video‚Äôs. Reaction videos are everywhere on youtube, and they they get a bit of a bad rap. But when you think about it this video format can range from absolutely terrible all the way to genuinely value adding and informative. The video‚Äôs that people like Graham or Kevin make are normally towards the good end. They will normally react to personal finance by watching video series like millennial money or they talk about high end real estate which is obviously an area of extensive expertise for these guys. There are other‚Äôs like Dave Ramsey who will do live reactions to people that call into the show and despite these being a bit repetitive they aren‚Äôt really doing any harm (apart from the ego‚Äôs of the callers) If you want to argue that these live interviews are not really reaction video‚Äôs just think to yourself, ‚Äúam I watching this to see the solution to the persons problem, oooorrrrr am I watching this to smugly partake in Dave‚Äôs reaction to this persons situation?‚Äù Even still this is just a bit of light entertainment and who knows, maybe you will pick up a nugget of information along the way. No problems there, apart from when these reactions turn into predictions‚Ä¶ Financial predictions are almost impossible to make‚Ä¶ even the largest financial firms in the world filled with teams of PHD Quantitative Analysts struggle to outperform regular market returns consistently, if at all. It‚Äôs therefore frustrating to see someone like Meet Kevin, make predictions about the future of a highly volatile stock like Tesla before his audience‚Ä¶ and yes I know‚Ä¶ he gives the standard disclaimer ‚Äúthat this is not financial advice‚Äù, but when a supposably reputable figure that positions themselves as a personal finance expert brings up an official looking spreadsheet and predicts 100% within the next 12 months‚Ä¶ well it‚Äôs not unrealistic to see how some of his impressionable audience would follow his not advice. Now this is just one of the most blatant examples, but all of these personal finance personalities is guilty of giving these ‚Äúnot advice‚Äù pieces of advice throughout their content. This can range anywhere from invest into dividend stocks, all the way up to only buy a duplex and rent out the other side. Both pieces of advice that are not necessarily bad, but are just grossly overgeneralised and make no accommodations for the financial situations of their viewers. Now my friend Richard over at the plain bagel actually made a video earlier this week that explored the issue of picking stocks from the perspective of an actual financial professional who‚Äôs job it is to pick stock for clients. I was actually considering not making this video at all after seeing that one because I thought Mr Bagel made a pretty fair and well rounded argument against this all‚Ä¶ but then‚Ä¶. I saw this‚Ä¶ Alright, this is where the serious issues start. Making up new rules for people to follow. I hate to be the one to break it to you, and I truly do mean this in the nicest possible way. But Graham Stephan is a ex real estate agent and social media influencer, HE DOES NOT KNOW the 5 best investments to make you rich. For that matter, nobody knows any investments that will make you rich, and if they did they sure wouldn‚Äôt be sharing them on a YouTube video. Despite popular opinions these days, good investments should not double overnight, they ‚Äúshould instead‚Äù continually provide value over many years or decades and return that value back to the investor steadily over the same time period. The generally accepted rate of return for a well-diversified portfolio is anywhere between 6% all the way up to 12% if your doing really well. The bad news here is that this is not going to make you rich, just like we said at the beginning of the vide. Well actually it‚Äôs not going to make you rich unless you have a decent income already and are very disciplined about consistently contributing to this portfolio over a long enough time period for compound interest to do it‚Äôs thing. Even then it will make you old and rich, which is not what the people want‚Ä¶ What they want is to hear about how the people talking to them got so rich. Which is where we get to the last type of concerning content‚Ä¶ Personal Stories about their success. Now who doesn‚Äôt love a good success story, especially when it‚Äôs the tale of a scrappy underdog proving all the naysayers wrong. Which is something most of these guys have. Graham didn‚Äôt get into university, Meet Kevin started from less than a thousand dollars, Dave Ramsey went totally bankrupt and the same is true for the rest of them, none are turning around and saying I studied like crazy through high school, got into a good university then became a doctor or an investment banker. Why? Well because it‚Äôs much more entertaining, and it sounds much more attainable to the average viewer. And whether we like to admit it to ourselves or not, there is an element of; ‚ÄúIf I watch these video‚Äôs I will learn to do what he did‚Äù Now that‚Äôs not to say these back stories are all a lie, but more so they are just the product of survivorship bias. For every Dave, Graham and Kevin, there are thousands of people that didn‚Äôt have the unique set of skills and the luck to break into the incredibly lucrative roles they found themselves in. Sure graham didn‚Äôt go to university, but he did work his way into an incredibly prestigious real estate firm, so what he lacked in book smarts were obviously more than made up for with personal branding and good old fashioned sales ability. If you are a fantastic salesman then sure go ahead. There is actually a widely accepted array of high paying jobs with varying levels of effort to certainty. Sales sits somewhere towards the riskier side of this array. Something that is very high effort would be becoming a surgeon or a dentist, it takes years and years in medical school, but once you are practicing you are all but garunteed a high income and standard of living for the rest of your life. Of course at the other end of the spectrum is something like ‚Äúbecoming a Rockstar, or famous actor, or yeah even a youtuber‚Ä¶.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt take too much effort when compared to years in med school, or 100 hour weeks in an investment bank but it‚Äôs also incredibly unlikely to pay off. Whether they do it intentionally or not the ‚Äúpersonal finance personalities‚Äù perpetuate the narrative of dropping out of school and building your own destiny, which has worked for them, but will not work for most people. It also sounds eerily familiar to the promises made by the more despicable side of the financial gurus‚Ä¶ Now there is one last problem with these personal back stories, and that is that they are used to justify all of these other pieces of content. To demonstrate this we are once again going to pick on Meet Kevin. One of his most popular video‚Äôs is the tale of how he built up his property portfolio from $0 to 5.5 million dollars by the age of 27. You are welcome to go and watch the video but the TLDR is that through a series of flips and equity releases he built up a highly leveraged position of real estate assets that were cash flow positive. Sounds great, but it is ridiculously risky. Take out 5:1 leveraged position in the stock market and most people will think you lost your mind, but take out a 10:1 leveraged position on a house, and you are an investment genius. Most people don‚Äôt realise how risky real estate can be. Now of course Kevin was lucky, he started investing at the start of one of the longest real estate bull runs in history and in his defence he has deleveraged his position significantly since, but this is the DEFINITION of survivorship bias. Nobody is making a video about how they lost their life savings trying to flip homes. Had Kevin started his investment journey in 2004, he certainly wouldn‚Äôt be telling stories of financial success on youtube, if anything he would be lucky to be an extra on the Big Short. (play scene of stripper with 5 houses and a condo) Now if I sound overly cinical let me follow this all up by saying given the opportunity to make as much money as these guys are by uploading videos to the internet I would sell out so damn fast‚Ä¶ But they are still selling something, it might not be a course, or an AI that can trade forex for you or even a book, but they are selling you into keep on watching. Bleak realities about the tough road to reliably create wealth doesn‚Äôt quiet grab attention like an open mouth and a flashy headline but in a world where attention is the new currency, you should spend yours wisely. Anyway, if you do happen to get rich by following in their footsteps you should follow that all up by commenting how dumb I am on this video and then watching our video on what to do next after making millions of dollars. If you did enjoy this video please consider liking and subscribing to keep on learning how money works."

Full Terms of Service - https://ziptrader.com/termsofservice/",1090.0,18617,117,folks we've got a lot to discuss number one we gotta give an update on the market and plays including one of our plays that went up a hundred plus percentage points this morning and then for the main entree I need to present our latest top idea ticker symbol you you you you is Universal Security instrument and it is in the security products and home alarm space it is a small cap stock with sales that are far far greater than market cap it is a profitable company it has assets that are way higher than market cap and it's super low float the company also has not diluted in a very long time and I see no reason for them to break that Trend this is a stock that you should put on your radar and start doing your due diligence on as fast as possible and if this is your first time here you should know that our top idea designation is the highest designation that we can bestow on a stock the other top ideas that we have had this year have been very very successful ranging from 44 up to 156 percent up in Max returns from alert price to Peak and averaging at 97.82 percent now of course it is difficult to catch the maximum move because you're not going to time things perfectly and past performance is not indicative of future returns but all I'm saying here is that we take our research very very seriously and you can tell based on the numbers that our previous picks have done and today's top idea I think is one of the most exciting on the list okay let's go ahead and get to work so we'll start with the market market started June in the green with the s p 5 hundo finishing 0.99 up your triple Q up about 1.16 percent this is largely due to de-risking over debt ceiling concerns as the bill moves through Congress but what is really impressive right now are all the big massive runners in the small cap space so many small caps are doing big rally ralitos and of course Charlie Charlie is always looking for that next rally rally tow so that you can grow your Wally walito and I believe that a big reason you're seeing so many small cap stocks run huge is because we are coming back from basically 12 to 18 months of small caps getting unanimously hammered no questions asked and now that broader markets are rallying well a lot of these Beatdown small caps are being rediscovered and going parabolic there are so many hidden gems beneath the surface right now that did not deserve to be beat down 99 in many cases from 2021 to 2022 and now we're able to Rally three four five even 10x and still and still be well below where they were in 2021. many of which actually have a good business behind them just didn't want to be acknowledged because of the terrible macro situation in terms of fed raising interest rates and people going risk off so aggressively the last 18 months building on to that let's go over the latest on place so we did have a massive winner this morning ticker symbol you car ucar we briefed on yukar at about 5 13 a share this morning and it ran up to 11 30 a couple hours after market open that's a total run of about 120 briefing price to Highs but why did we brief on it Charlie Charlie too well it had exciting partnership news yukar AKA you power announced a cooperation partnership so Cooperative with Quantum Solutions Quantum Solutions is a Japanese electric vehicle maker with a market cap of around 10.81 billion billion dollars and as you know small cap companies partnering with much bigger companies tend to have big big rallies as a result of that news announcement MarketWatch reported quote you power said it plans to work with Quantum to develop business initiatives related to marketing research and development of new energy Vehicles Financial Technologies battery Banks EV charging and Battery swapping operations and services in Japan you power set the company's plan to recruit other partners in the field of new energy storage such as battery developers and that they may establish a joint venture to further pursue the cooperation so not only is ucar getting a ton of press from this but they're also showing a lot of proof of concept in their Tech if they're partnering with this big big company and they are leaving the door open here to more partnership catalysts as they said they're planning to recruit other partners right so lots of things here that has caused this to run and get a lot of excitement in the stock so if you missed this stock in this trade what is the lesson here what can you take away from this well always look for stocks in the pre-market that have dropped partnership news the smaller the company you are trading and the bigger the company that it is partnering with the bigger the Run could be right and if you would like some help scouting out these plays in Catalyst I will put a link to zip Trader you down below and we'd love to have you in our daily morning briefings again this was one that we briefed on pretty early coupon code Memorial 50 will get you 50 off before checkout and that expires at the end of the week okay next wlds so wlds has been a big Runner as well for full context we originally briefed on this bad bad girl back on the 25th at about 58 cents a share and as of this morning it hit 2.36 that's a 306 percent run week over week briefing price to highs pretty insane especially considering the Catalyst wasn't even that great essentially this is running on the process of getting their mudra band for their Apple watch to Market I think people just want to buy Runners at this point we are back in this market where folks they aren't really concerned about the businesses what the underlying fundamentals look like they just want to make money and I am all for that I'm not complaining at all but you got to be very very careful this play has been very very successful but like I said at the last cycle hi this is very very very over bought sure it looks like it's primed to break out even higher and the momentum is pretty strong but at the end of the day this is going to drop like a rock so if you're going to continue playing this momentum my suggestion is have very very tight risk management these plays are very very fun but if you marry them if you marry them and you have 15 kids with them it's going to be a bad time it's going to be a disaster next an update on AI so we covered the short squeeze setup on AI earlier this week here on the channel and how we would in all likelihood get a judo chop to the share price and after that bottoms would start forming and so far the bottom looks to be in around the 30 dollar range and change and we'll see what happens but in terms of a short setup interestingly enough shorts are actually further accelerating their position short interest has popped up back to 29.69 percent a couple of days ago it was only at 26 percent so shorts are actually using this downtrend here to dump more and kneecap the momentum before it gets picking up again my guess is they probably dumped a ton after earnings which the earnings were never going to live up to the share price because the stock had gone up 200 plus percent on the year here so I think what short sellers did is they're like okay well hey it's not going to measure up let's plan to dump a ton a ton of share shorts right at earnings release that's going to panic everybody else that they're gonna think oh the earnings were a disaster for the stock the Stock's going out of business the company's going out of business and they're going to panic sell and that's exactly what happened and I think they did a pretty damn good job however the problem is that if it does pick up in momentum again you could very very well see a much bigger squeeze now and in effect wherever and whenever this Bottom's probably somewhere around 30 or 25 by early next week I'm expecting to see another cycle to the upside similar to the stair-step patterns we've had throughout the entire uptrend I could be wrong it wouldn't be the first or the last time I've been wrong but but that is the operating thesis at this point okay now it is time for today's main entree triple U and before we even get into it I do want to remind you to always make sure to do your own due diligence and risk management our channel is all about publishing ideas for you to go out and analyze yourself and take value away from some of them you're going to like some of them you won't like and also remember what has happened historically all of our top ideas have had huge trading opportunities but but very very short term that's why they are trade ideas not long-term investment ideas not marriage ideas if you look at the spreadsheet of our other top ideas this year they've had again an average Max return at roughly 97.82 but you got to realize that most of them hit their peaks about one to three days after their call out so again make sure that you're looking at these from a short-term trading perspective there are a lot of inefficiencies in this market there are a lot of catalysts in this market but very very few of them stick and stick for long periods of time and who really even cares if they stick for long periods of time we want stocks that can move now not stocks that can move 35 years from now anyways let's go ahead and get to work so uu is Universal Security Instruments and it is in the security products and home alarm space they sell these smoke and fire alarms hopefully they aren't the ones that run out of battery and beep when you're trying to sleep in the middle of the damn night if they were then that'd be enough to short the stock for sure just kidding but they have a number of indoor and outdoor security products bathroom ventilation products and so forth that all sounds very very boring right why are you even talking about this Charlie this ain't no AI stock this ain't no new biotech Runner well I agree it is very very boring but but boring companies are very very easy to understand and very very easy to spot pricing and efficiencies you pull up their reported numbers they reported 16.25 million in sales for the nine months ended December 31st for a full year you were looking at something like 20 million in sales with the company trading at a market cap of about 5.39 million so that means in other words that this company is selling about four times about four times their market cap every year you go over to their assets you're looking at 9.34 million in total assets they put their current liabilities at about 4 million which leaves you at about 5.2 million net in literal asset value right which destroys the argument that this is trading at a huge huge premium it simply isn't most small cap stocks are not only trading way way above one-time sales they're trading at like 10 15 time sales but but they have no money they're about to go bankrupt in three months and they don't even know how to pronounce the word profit this company is the complete opposite and it is a profitable company and with a profitable company you simply don't have to deal with the massive massive evaporating cash you don't have to deal with the same level of cash burn because guess what well it's profitable it's not burning more and more cash quarter over quarter month over month year over year this company is profitable and that's probably the reason it hasn't diluted in such a long time the Share account has stayed virtually the same for years so again when you have a small cap company that has all of these things going for it in terms of sales in terms of assets in terms of profitability well you're not going to have to worry about a lot of the other things that you usually have to worry about in the small cap space in terms of really really extreme dilution in terms of some really really crazy debt offering so on and so forth the last report showed nice sales increases in expense cut and there are many reasons to believe that the numbers on the next report will look even better in the last report the company reported quote the primary reasons for the sale increase during the three and nine month periods ended December 23rd or 31 2022 were improvements in deliveries from China and less Port congestion in Long Beach California the primary reasons for the increases in net income during the three and nine month periods were lower selling fright advertising and professional expenses partially offset by the higher cost of electrical components due to continuing supply chain issues said the president and CEO so they cited improvements in deliveries from China and less Port congestion in Long Beach as reasons for sale increases at year end 2022. well guess what has happened since then while China has almost fully reopened and Long Beach congestion is almost completely gone on top of that a lot of the other costs have come down in terms of fright they've dropped off a cliff advertising costs have also dropped off a cliff so numbers should look even better in future reports for this company going back to the Chart well despite the company looking better than it has in years despite the company trading at like one-fourth yearly sales and despite the company's business model being profitable well the stock is trading at a fraction a fraction of what it was during the highs Last Summer and when it was at these highs last summer that was a bad period of time for small caps right now is a much better time for small caps look at some other periods of time mid-2021 it was trading at 9 55 at highs early 2021 it was trading at 1988 at highs probably holding closer to 10 if you adjust for liquidity so the point here folks if you look at the stock objectively it's a stock that has gotten beaten down with all the other small caps the last year plus and markets haven't wanted to question that beat down because ooh it's a small cap that means scary that means bad but but guess what markets are rallying higher and higher so folks I would start your due diligence on this one I would look at the business I would look at the trend I would look at where this was trading during other periods of time and how much weaker their business model was back then despite the fact that their stock was so much higher and then look at where the stock is right now and compare it because I think there's a big pricing and efficiency here and also by the way if you want to be the first to hear about our top ideas like this play you you well we do post them for zip Trader you Members First in zip parade review in our private Discord which comes with the program this morning we posted about triple U at 10 19 a.m Charlie California time and the stock was trading at about 193 at that time the stock is now trading at around 230 to 240. so sometimes the heads up can be pretty helpful anyways if that sounds like something that would be useful to you make sure to take advantage of our Memorial 50 coupon code on zip trade review before it expires at the end of the week have a good one folks and we'll see you in the next video

investors out there welcome back to the making Easy Money YouTube channel where our main focusing goal is to make money in the stock market and what we came to discuss here in today's video is Mother stock and as you all know the entire auto manufacturer sector as a whole is seeing a pretty green day here so far up 2.55 as a whole and if we take a brief look and check out mulling we can give most of that credit due to Tesla because that's the big fish in the sector but as you guys know um we're currently facing some current downwards pressure here on that extra large scale which points to hedge funds and or institutional presence now as you guys know huge outflow and favorment can and more than often point to Short Selling and as you guys see here on the extra large scale we do see massive outflow early into days trading day that lets us know shorts did load this boat within the first five minutes of trading now as you all know today we are not short sale restricted ladies and gentlemen um no I take that back yes we are we did fall SSR here yesterday dropping as low as 68 cents so that means we do face an entire day of short sale restricted that doesn't mean any short shares aren't available that just means those short orders will have to be filled on the uptick now I know a lot of people are wondering and speculating will June be a better month month for mullet and I am here to tell everyone I truly believe so due to the fact that we shouldn't see speculative buying rolling into the play here pretty soon in speculation of those class three chassis going in production here in July now like if I've been telling everyone um if you have been keeping up the channel Mullen has one more wild card and we're not talking about maeo ladies and gentlemen we're talking about Mullins solid polymer State Technology and that is a battery technology that is said it can get the mother five up to 600 miles plus on Range per charge and it can charge up to 50 percent in just 18 minutes alone and this is the type of battery technology that compete that competition cannot compete with now at the end of this year we should get some more testing results in the year 2024 with that Battery Technology going into the vehicles now so far the Battery Technology is only fitted for the Mullen 5 they haven't said anything about the Bollinger products nor their class um nor their cargo vans ladies and gentlemen but it is said once you put these two things together we're talking about the silent polymer State Battery as well as m-a-e-o Lawrence harges Technology you combine those together guys and you will get in range over a thousand miles per charge and the reason why this is um and the reason why this is achievable is because Lawrence hardest technology makes it 75 percent more efficient than without his technology guys and teaming that up with the solid polymer State Battery guys you have a major wild card on your hands now Mullen is a 51 shareholder in maeo which means they are a controlling state but they did give Lawrence Hearts the goal to make um decisions when it comes to m-a-e-o now that everything is behind us ladies and gentlemen what is in front of us is this major production announcement now that alone isn't going to set Mullen on the right path but it is going to shed light in the right direction for sure we know for a fact that Randy Marion deliveries and orders is a huge step for Mullen if you ask me that is a step on the moon not say it's it's going to the moon but that was a huge milestone for a company like mullet also guys just to be fair Mullen is currently facing bankruptcy not in the very near future but we're talking about within the next year at this rate now one thing that can save them and I do believe that they may do this it's a 90 chance this will happen ladies and gentlemen due to the fact that they did push back the production of the Mullen five I do see them actually leasing out that facility to one of these startup EV companies just to bring in some Revenue ladies and gentlemen so they will not have to dilute as you guys know they don't have many shares left to dilute slightly over 10 million shares left to go and that isn't a lot when your company is only a see a market cap of 125.95 million and a share price of 73 I do believe they will not want to take that route and they're going to lean towards leasing out one of their facilities now with that being said guys is this the time to buy Mullins stock I do consider grabbing a small position here early in the month of June may be a great idea but far as jumping off the deep end I would just wait until the announcement that production has started for those chassis ladies and gentlemen now with Mullen actually focusing on this commercial vehicles they will in fact have an edge over these other startup EV companies due to the fact that we all know that these major auto manufacturers has an edge when it comes to getting their cars to the market due to the fact they already have the real estate they already have these dealerships on every single corner and I'm talking about your Chevy dealerships your Buick the list goes on anything under the General Motors umbrella also Ford has car lots everywhere so getting their product to Market is much much faster for these major your auto manufacturers not only that their production capability allows them to sell their cars a little bit cheaper than what these startup EV companies are going to have to deal with also we already know cars sell off of culture and a loyal fan base so for instance a lawyer or a doctor that continues to drive Mercedes-Benz and when they want to convert over to EV now they have their electric Mercedes-Benz available ladies and gentlemen that is why I feel as though that Mullen will not win the war when it comes to general purpose vehicles but with them actually focusing on their commercial side of things that is currently a untapped market and it has huge huge potential we can see these type of things apply to distribution centers ladies and gentlemen warehouses and much much more especially Mullins Battery Technology last year the CEO did make a statement saying that they are in talks with OEM companies about their Battery Technology and we're about the solid polymer State Battery ladies and gentlemen not m-a-e-o and the CEO said they are in talks with Outsourcing that technology to OEM companies and that is the type of companies guys like the electric pallet jacks we might be able to find that Battery Technology in if Mullen wants to Outsource it to them um reach trucks uh forklifts the list goes on guys uh Mullen has a octopus style reach they can actually do a lot of things once this solid polymer State Battery Technology is completely looked over completely reviewed and um and we get all the data and feedback off of that guys I believe that that is going to be mullen's wild card for sure so with that being said guys if you agree with anything I said in this video can you please leave a thumbs up on it also if you're new to the channel consider hitting that subscribe button make sure you have all post notifications set to also you will be alerted each and every time I create one of these videos and may the games be with you [Music] foreign

Please do your own research and consult a financial advisor before making your own decision to buy or sell any cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrencies is risky.  NotFinancialAdvice.Crypto,447.0,6045,51,why do I hold Dent because Dent is the chosen one to revolutionize the global mobile data market helping to operationalize the most prioritized action of the United Nations 17 sustainable development goals an agenda set to receive trillions of dollars before 2030. the sdg's agenda is the un's official roadmap for Global Innovation like a big to-do's list for the New World Order and to me this agenda is the best place to look for long-term Investments because the wealthiest most powerful organizations on Earth are all backing it making its success seem kind of inevitable so what's dent and how is it connected to the sdgs well first there's a token tent coin an exchange Dent exchange and a company Dent Wireless Dent Wireless is the world's first digital and Global mobile operator and the dent exchange is the first Global Marketplace for mobile data dense mission is to liberate the mobile data market by tokenizing data itself allowing customers to buy sell or donate data on demand through esim technology what's esem esim is the new industry standard digital Sim set to replace the obsolete physical Sim that will allow users to activate cellular Plans remotely and without traditional contracts esim is one of the most crucial Technologies needed for enabling the internet of things and will be in billions of connected devices in the future and it won't just be phones that need data before esim the only way to get mobile data was through corporations who'd lock people into expensive monthly contracts which meant they had no control over their data if they used too much they paid fees if they had a surplus they couldn't sell it basically until esim there was no easy way to buy the precise amount of data you personally consumed and there was no affordable way for people in least developed countries to easily activate mobile devices where Modern infrastructure didn't yet exist enter esim and Dent with the prediction that esim would eventually be the global standard Dent Wireless created a future ecosystem for the sale of mobile data utilizing the infrastructure of existing telcos debt enables mobile operators to sell competitive data packages on the dent app through Dent coin while simultaneously allowing users to sell or donate their unused data on the dent exchange effectively unlocking the unsold data market for the first time which by the way is an enormous untapped Market in the words of co-founder Miko linamaki data is sold in silos per operator and usually in fixed denominations so either the user uses too little and loses the remain at the end of the billing cycle or they use too much and have to pay excess charges as an example of just 15 percent of data sold goes unused a whopping 4.8 billion dollars of value is virtually forfeit using its partner telcos like a union and leveraging their Collective buying power the dent esim Marketplace built on blockchain has the power to one day establish a free market value for Global Digital Data making it more affordable and accessible for all now back to the sdgs think about it if you're the world's most powerful organizations unwef Etc and you need to spread a bunch of global propaganda for your One World Vision to succeed that's not going to be possible if billions of people still aren't connected to the internet this makes mobile internet access and affordable data in least developed countries the most prioritized action of the sdgs but don't take it from me take it from gsma the global systems for mobile Communications Association which is the industry's largest Telco Forum they State mobile technology will be at the center of efforts to achieve the sdgs it's worth noting gsma is directly partnered with the UN and works with them on many sdgs initiatives it's also worth noting they're partnered with dent and this might give us our first clue into how debt was able to sign so many Partnerships so rapidly in so many countries because in total of the 109 mobile operators Dennis partnered with 91 are official members of gsma and since we know dense use case perfectly aligns with the sdgs and we know gsma is directly working on the sdgs with the UN it would definitely make sense that they'd be interested in a platform like dense remember to make the internet more affordable and accessible for all mostly means bringing it to those who don't have it yet and these people are likely living in one of 46 countries on the un's least developed countries list well through the Partnerships mentioned dentists already able to provide data top-ups to nearly 70 percent of those countries so you have gsma a direct un partner appearing to help integrate a future decentralized Marketplace for mobile data Dent into every least developed country in an effort to improve internet access which is coincidentally the most prioritized goal of the un's sdgs that gsma is actively working toward makes enough sense to me and since we're on the topic of things obviously being connected to the UN as part of dense Ico Dent actually pledged 1 billion tokens one percent of the total supply to the un's sdgs targeted at implementation of modern telecommunications infrastructure in developing countries pay attention to those words implementing infrastructure sounds a lot like the other co-founder of tarot katajanan's previous job is mobile systems Development Associate for a un office that literally describes itself as dedicated to implementing infrastructure for the United Nations system and look at the timing of it all tarot privately starts dent in 2014 starts working at the UN on implementing infrastructure projects for the UN system in January 2017 and then months later denco's public in July of that same year and speaking of implementing infrastructure that is exactly what sdg number nine and its sub targets are explicitly about to facilitate sustainable infrastructure development for developing countries and universal access to information and Communications technology clearly Dent was created for the sdgs remember and I'll say it again the un can't achieve the sdgs without affordable accessible internet for all because without it educating people around the world with Perpetual inescapable propaganda would be impossible this is where sdg number four comes in quality education sdg4 aims to provide children and young people with quality and easy access to propaganda I'm sorry education but notice what the UN says is the main cause for the current lack of quality Global education lack of Internet access they write lack of Internet access reduces paths to a world of information available online and limits the potential to learn and grow icts which are information and communication Technologies and the internet are critical enablers of the sdgs providing unprecedented social and economic benefits for millions of people around the world notably they support sdg4 and 5. now it takes a little less convincing that dun's working on sdg number four because the basic internet Foundation literally spells it out stating that they in partnership with end are contributing directly to the United Nations sdg4 with basic Digital Services this statement comes from the bif website after they successfully connected 50 000 students in rural Kenya to the internet in 2021 alongside dent I posted a video you can watch on my Twitter of Secretary General of the bif Joseph Knoll stating in a presentation that because of this Project's success they're now meeting with the UN monthly discussing a plan to scale up to the National framework to bring internet to every school in Kenya and Beyond and it's then revealed the next countries they're targeting are Tanzania and Ethiopia with 200 schools already funded for development and a goal of 5 000 schools connected by the end of 2023. clearly the UN is aware of Dent okay now back to the inevitable adoption of esim did you know that of the 12 largest smartphone manufacturers that account for more than 99 of smartphone production in the world all 12 are moving to esim technology and it's estimated that 85 to 90 percent of all new smartphones shipped in 2025 will support esim and this obviously includes Apple and Samsung by the way the trend is clear Apple's new iPhone 14 completely removed the physical Sim and is now esim only in the US and Samsung is on its way as well now what if I told you Samsung was partnered with the UN and that millions of their phones actually come with an sdg zap on the home screen that pays people to learn about the sdgs keep that in mind when we head over to Samsung's blockchain website and see dense logo front and center and that's because dense a direct partner of Samsung blockchain an apple dentist featured on the official Apple website under worldwide service providers and has a four and a half star rating in the App Store and it also may be worth pointing out the not so subtle Apple logo in Miko and amaki's picture on the Dent website now ask yourself this the million dollar question does a project that's partnered with gsma and Samsung that was created by a un developer to help achieve the biggest UN Agenda of the decade that somehow partnered with 109 mobile operators in 70 countries before Eason was even mainstream yet have the potential to gain more value into the future can Dent coin become more widely adopted and give us a return in our investment one day no one can know the answer to this question for sure but what we can know is that esim is just getting started and it's only a matter of time before billions of esim devices are starving for data on the internet of things and if that's the future and it's looking like it is I can see the first decentralized Global Mobile Data exchange built on esim having a pretty good shot at success finally done strong connections to the UN and their use case precisely aligning with the sdgs makes me feel confident Dent will continue to receive the best guidance from the agenda writers themselves and will succeed in their mission Dent was created for a purpose and that purpose is coming to fruition to end I am not a financial advice and this is not Financial advice this channel is also not sponsored in any way and I've never had a single communication with the Dent Team I'm just a torment in Seoul putting my thoughts out there on the internet thanks for listening check out my other videos and songs like comment and subscribe and as always stay bullish [Music]

present the stock you may be inclined to be like no that's a stupid trade idea but I think there's really a big play here and I want you to just watch the entire video before you click off before you think okay maybe I don't agree with him just hear out all of my points because I think this is one of the most fascinating setups that we've seen probably in the last six to 12 months we have a stock today that is trading at about 13 cents that I believe could very easily get to 43 cents 45 cents just completely blow through a lot of the previous resistance levels that it failed to break and folks look I see a lot of Rally rallito or Sergey mcsurgey potential here but I've been wrong many times in the past we'll be wrong many times in the future my job here on this channel and my intention is just to present you with my research and why I like the setup but you have to be the ultimate judge you're the one taking the risk so you got to be the one doing the ultimate Frisk I promise I'm going to stop with that a catchphrase very soon I gotta come up with another one if you have another catchphrase for me comment down below handful disclosure I own zero shares of this my goal with this video is to present research that is hopefully going to age very well and encourage you to keep coming back to us for more in the future that's the business model of zip Trader okay so the ticker that we're going to be talking about today is brds and this is a very important time to talk about her because she has just concluded her first massive spiky spiky that threw her to just under 25 cents and now she's been in a very very aggressive take profit cycle that I believe is about to conclude and I believe was artificially created by massive massive dumping of shares in fact I don't just believe that but the short data the short data backs that up you have massive massive Short Selling here bringing the price down and it's been very very successful and if it's allowed to have its way it's probably going to push it down to zero but I think but I think that this is actually going to bottom a lot sooner I think it's going to bottom and cause a lot a lot of Ricochet effects this is the company that makes the bird scooters and electric bikes that plague the street streets of many major cities in the U.S and my first instinct too is what a damn boringly simple and kind of stupid business model that's very easy for competitors to compete against and just rise up against sure bird is popular and well known but it's not exactly the sexiest sounding play in fact a lot of times I have a little bit of a vendetta against them because a lot of their Riders will go and ride in the middle of the damn road and I'm trying to drive my car and you got this guy over there on his damn scooter I'm like buddy hey pal get over and he's like no I got a scooter it's like these people have never heard of a sidewalk but nonetheless there are a lot of reasons that you should pay attention to the stock the first reason is that insiders are buying like crazy bird announced purchases of shares by management and directors totaling over 1.5 million shares purchased you had two officers and one director buying a substantial number of shares eighty thousand one million 320 000 200 000 which total about 1.5 million and they bought all of these in the last couple of weeks here in March and they bought them at a price that is usually around 12 to 13 which is about at the price that we're trading at currently give or take a few cents which means that not only do insiders think the company is worth buying at the current price but when this was widely reported the price actually nearly doubled so speculators and Traders went and heard about insiders buying the company and they doubled the price but now that that attention is washed away it's gone back down which has allowed it to get back to the price that these insiders had bought at originally now you and I both know that insiders can and often are morons and they buy their stocks at really really elevated prizes a lot of the time but but and this is very very key here there's a certain level of confidence in a stock when insiders are buying instead of just dumping everything however now the price is back to the point where they bought it at which means markets know they can buy in at what the management thought was fair number two the company is in a very solid liquidity position they have 33.4 million in cash and cash equivalents 4.9 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents 2.1 million in accounts receivable 1.5 million in inventory and 22.6 million in prepaid expenses which comes out to 64.8 million in total current assets but the entire market cap is only at 43 million and change and then you go for a second and you add in restricted cash vehicle deposits Vehicles net and other assets and you're at 225 million and change in terms of total assets and if you want to go and net it out assets minus liabilities you're still in a very solid position something like 25 million bucks but what really matters here and why you want to pay attention to how much cash they have access to and how many assets they have the reason this really matters is because my two biggest fears in life are death and dilution and with death I mean ZIP Trader can always issue more Charlie's so dilution dilution is really the bigger threat here those of you who are new with this and those who watch us already know this but if you're playing with small cap stocks your biggest enemy is always going to be companies that are issuing more and more shares and diluting you up the Wazoo but they are much less likely to dilute if they are already in a solid cash position because it puts them at a disadvantage when they are issuing at such a low price they're in a very very strong cash position so they don't need to destroy shareholders and and it's going to only work against them if they destroy shareholders so again in terms of dilution one of the best parts of the setup is you're probably not going to have it number three earnings came out and they were solid and the price reacted positively but it was suppressed very very quickly which I believe is an inefficiency on March 10th they put out a press release that their revenue had beat Expectations by 20.91 million their adjusted ebitda was 6.1 million their positive cash flow of 5 to 10 million and markets were originally very very thrilled the stock went on a journey from 10 cents to nearly 25 cents which was then accelerated by the positive news about Insider's buying but that entire that entire rally cycle has now almost completely evaporated for a company that reported something that's far above shareholder expectations and Market expectations and analyst expectations and a company that's seen insiders go and buy the stock well you put all this together and I would make a strong argument that this is trading artificially low but the reason that this one is particularly interesting is because I believe that this is being suppressed Us by short Sellers and they are setting themselves up for massive massive Ricochet effects you open up the chart you have this level of spikability where the stock has these days where you get people trying to buy in they break through momentarily in the stock spikes dramatically but then it gets crushed shortly after why again I'd argue a big reason is because shorts dump on them every single up day and they do it aggressively helping completely destroy any interest in the stock and then completely destroy any ability for it to get any sizable momentum any sort of momentum in the stock is completely crushed so that no form of morale can be built and cause the momentum to keep building and building and killing the shorts short interest had continued piling on and suppressing the move throughout most of the last six months but then earnings came out and these shorts did temporarily freak out and started covering but they are once again trying to throw the book and have help Drive the post earnings uptrend way back down so hey it started rallying a little bit shorts freaked out thinking they were going to get screwed and then all of a sudden they realized okay well now we can have a stronghold back on the stock we're going to go ahead and just dump we're going to dump faster than what happens after you eat at the Taco Bell and so it looks like they dumped on this so aggressively that it just completely completely destroyed any and all momentum which look Kudos they were able to get the stock down and if they keep pushing it down to zero they're going to make tons of profits but they are working with the assumption that markets won't care about a bird rental company a little scooter rental company they're operating under the assumption that they could get away with this and convincing markets that this is going to go bankrupt even though they have very solid cash liquidity as I showed earlier and they think they could probably get this a lot closer to zero and remember folks when you have a small cap stock with a tight float well it doesn't take much doesn't take much buying to move that stock up a lot and likewise it doesn't take much Short Selling much dumping of shares that you don't own for the stock to go down quite a lot too so every single little sizable run of buyers that caused a spike in the price were immediately immediately suppressed before they could attract any more attention and the one wave that caused more sustainable momentum was hit with Firepower that the stock had never even seen really before so the reason that I want to bring this dog to your attention is because shorts are looking at the stock and ignoring a lot of the fundamental strength that it has on its books and its balance sheet because they think again who the hell is going to care about a scooter rental company when banks are collapsing left and right so my thought process is if this can bottom out soon it's actually going to be incredibly ripe for a squeeze maybe one of the best in the small cap space right now it could quickly start seeing those previous resistance levels be broken and I think you could see this break back above 18 25 27 and maybe even get back to those November Highs at about 45 cents obviously you're going to need to see proof of concept as it hits each level but I think that it's possible here if you get enough attention on the stock if you get enough people saying hey wait a second this company actually has a pretty strong liquidity situation maybe it's not worth zero dollars I think that brds is unique for all the reasons that we mentioned but also I think it's Unique because it has that Dynamic where a lot of people think of this business in a negative light they think of it kind of like your Bed Bath and Beyond your retail stores right your GameStop your AMC your red box so on and so forth these Party City type stocks that people think are very very toxic so they're not even willing to buy it so shorts can just completely have their way with the stock and they tend to not think about risk because they're like oh well the Market's already decided this is a garbage stock so I could just short it as much as possible and drive that price down like a dock but similar to those if enough people see this opportunity I think you're going to get a lot of squeezy mcqueezy and that could leave shorts open to severe severe pain for now what I'm looking at with this stock is what I said you want to see it bottom you want to see some proof of concept of the uptrend and you want to watch those resistance levels and by the way quick plug if you want to be the first to see

everything is green guys pow Green in your face out there so we are seeing that Bitcoin right now is above 27 000 out there fantastic fan free fantastic we're seeing a theory was up also 1.63 yeah baby and we're seeing that most of the crypto markets are doing this making a nice move the upside BNB is up as well you guys know that BNB uh that binance they kind of left Canada they're out of there but the good point is so that because the binance is out it looks like Kraken has improved it's a user base by 25 so all of the binance Canadian all the binance Canadian Universe users Universe users out there have moved to Cracker lock and so that's been a windfall for Crockett xrp is up guys remember we've got something big that's going to be happening June 13th so get ready uh and I I mean this ain't Financial advice but I I think that that xrp at 50 cents is definitely definitely a cheap cheap buy I am buying more 80 80 a xrp Ada as well is a freaking good deal and these are some of the big coins I think that I you should be holding not Financial advice uh you definitely want to be holding BNB you definitely want to be doing that uh definitely want to be holding Ada because remember 88 uh at the last Bull Run was up uh pretty close to like three bucks right if I'm not mistaken xrp I think xrp is definitely going to have a run to three dollars as well all right goes your Doge out there is also looking pretty pretty pretty peachy keen it's at zero seven two oh six four that is good out there and we're seeing that doge is up about 0.22 but it's not as up as much as a Bitcoin which is up zero seven eight percent so that's good that's good what else we got going on we got we got Shiba Inu I mean Shiba Inu is just doing its thing the shipping is not looking good Matic is also one of those top coins that you should be looking at as well in uh for the next Bull Run so overall we're seeing that the crypto markets are looking pretty pretty darn tune positive out there so that is good and one of the reasons that is fueling fueling this positiveness out there is that finally the US government has passed a debt sealant I said it you heard it that the US government has passed a freaking debt ceiling and what does that mean to you and me is that the US ain't going to go bankrupt it means that the U.S government just got the green light to pass hit the printing press drive up uh inflation drive down the value of the dollar out there so at some point in the near future the not too distant future if you buy a can of Coca-Cola it could cost you 10 cents you know uh maybe it's going to cost you 20 bucks for a loaf of Wonder Bread out there guys go so go Wonder on that one so that's what's going on the debt ceiling has been passed other other interesting news Elon Musk related news we are seeing right now that uh the guy that was suing Elon Musk causing call call calling uh Elon Musk the perpetuator of the Dogecoin Ponzi scheme is also uh basically saying look he look here's the proof here's the proof out there uh that you changed the uh Twitter logo to the dojo back again he's saying look to the to the judge look here's the evidence that Elon Musk uh is pump and dump uh for uh Dogecoin Ponzi scheme guys what do you think you think Elon Musk is pumping and dumping the Dogecoin to his own gains that he's making gains based on his pump and dump now you all know that uh you know Elon Musk just has to say something about anything or even even off off the cuff comment related to any crypto project out there anything's gonna pump right you know so guys do you think that Elon Musk intentionally pumps and dumps the douche or is this just happenstance is it just freaking coincident out there you tell me what you gotta you tell me what you think out there guys I'm not going to give you my opinion I want to hear the comments guys so put on a comment out there what's going with the pep store out there whoa looks like Shiba wee wow Shiba wee be right now just turned green wow now Shiba weebi right now is at zero nine a bunch of zeros and nine out there so that's good and that is some that is some massive massive freaking resistance that Shiba Inu has not been able to get past we're also seeing the dot the the pep the Pepe coin I mean I don't say it's done like a donut but it's going to be done like a donut for a while I'm kind of you know not looking at me I do have a little bit of Pep I do have a little bit Pepe I sold most of it already but I'm keeping a little bit out there that's what I'm doing but overall things are looking good uh ethereum like I said 2000 is going to be a 2000 could be incoming so guys the debt ceiling is in that's good the FED has a green light to print more freaking money the FED has a green light to in to uh basically inflation is going to go Berserker gonna go medieval and uh of course we're all everyone's thinking about the June 14th uh is the rig hikes out there and uh most people are saying no rake hikes out there and even the number two the deputy the deputy out there uh is also saying Powell's Deputy is saying no Rick hi so guys what do you think Rick hikes no Rick hikes tell me what you think I'd love to hear it I'd love to know I want to be in the know from you and you out there in YouTube land out there so it's a great time to be live here into crypto and you're into the OG and you're into anything crazy out there go down there smash the like smash the freaking likes right now and did you know that once again the Dogecoin in terms of all the mean coins on planet Earth that Dogecoin holders are the only holders that more than 45 percent are in the money all the other uh all the other mean coins is pretty bad situation out there so that's interesting that is cool that is fantastic guys go down there uh check out my merch I appreciate it guys don't forget if you've got a if you've got your crypto on a centralized exchange you want to

I think it's easily possible for Sofi to get back up there in the next year or two and we'll see at the end of this video I will come up and show you what the analysts on Wall Street believe I will give you the price predictions the so five price prediction we will see if these are the top Investments to make for 2023 especially in June I know what you're saying also don't you think there's going to be a recession coming Moe I do but I also think some stocks such as Sofi when you look at this thing have been beaten up so far that they're a limited downside in any positive Catalyst could actually propel them through a recession and I think this is one of them companies that give us that opportunity not all companies are going to make it through a recession in terms of hey they didn't they went up well some of them are still going to get beat up it's just are they going to get beat up more than the market or not I think so far has that chance to actually outperform the market even with the recession the next of the best growth stocks to buy now the the top Investments to make look at DraftKings this year 110 up remember what I told you that draftking should be the leader when it comes to the sports wagering if anybody has files that that sector I believe that DraftKings was going to be your ultimate winner now you see this and you say mo that's a hundred and ten 110 up that's huge yeah but if you go out to five years you see they are still trading 67 percent down from that top could they get back up there well if they did you would see this run uh probably about 200 percent up from where we're at now just to get back up to Prior hires could we see that we could I think that's a ways down the road but I think revisiting 40 here in the low 40s that we are at and the end of 2021 is not impossible to do so I do feel pretty good about that and I could see that happening in the next uh hopefully we see that happening in the next two years as the FED drops the race back down I think a lot of money will flow back into the markets and these more risky stocks will get a lot of love and you could see them running up as they are newer companies growth companies and that's what I'm looking for we'll look at the DraftKings price prediction at the end of this video the next of the best growth stocks to buy now we got a volunteer out there and for those that don't know we know that Kathy Wood has been loading the boat with this one and there are quite a few YouTubers out there to file this stock as well they have gotten a lot of love and for good reason they're up 130 for the year and if you come out there go five years they're not they're nowhere close to where they were they're 58 down sort of reminds you of the DraftKings right and we know they got the AI tie-in the government contract tracks all the good stuff the question is will they return to their former glory and I do believe the answer is yes I think we could see this thing run back up and we'll see how it does like I said but I did want to add this to the list of ones I'm looking to load up so when people hear me you guys hear me talking about this list of the best growth stocks to buy for 2023 in June these are the ones I will DCA into as we get through all these different moments in time there's no right answer to say hey when are you gonna buy when are you going to sell when are you gonna do this I don't have the crystal ball I wish I did but I don't have that DC crystal ball that a lot of people have so we got to come up with the strategies based on the data based on what the FED tells us that the fed's continuing to raise rates that's tough on growth companies so you got to be careful you don't want to load all up while the fed's still in quantitative tightening so I am watching all these events but it doesn't mean we can't start taking positions and then dcaing through it but that's something we'll talk about the next of the best best growth stocks to buy now of course should be no surprise to anybody it is Tesla I absolutely love Tesla this thing gets 40 of its Revenue in China so the risk is China isn't doing as well as we thought they would be doing but they are doing quantitative easing which is big for Tesla but we are going to see recessions like I said before Germany's in a recession UK could be staring at one and this will affect Tesla in the U.S is staring at one will we see them in the second half of 2023 like a lot of analysts are predicting I think so as well so yes I think we will so it could be a bumpy road but dcaing through that bumpy road could help us now we look at Tesla take a look at the year down 20 percent but from the highs it's still down 50 so I gave you a few stocks that people were buying when they're at the highs now I give you a chance to look at these at 50 off or more from those highs and people will they walk away and it's always funny it's like when the stocks are high people want to jump open with both feet but when they get cut in half or even more they're like I don't want to touch that what's changed well they I know they increased the revenue and things are getting better I don't want to touch it now though I want to wait till it's up another 100 200 before I jump back in and that's not the way to do it we got to make sure we are looking at these and taking advantage so it's up to you these are higher risks but one of the highest risks of the best stocks to buy now I have is coinbase why because obviously they're fighting it out with the government anytime I see that it is a big red flag to con to absolutely watch yourself there's no guarantees it's going to come out winning but if they do and I think they can we could see some good things they're trying to follow all the rules and regulations they just need to be told what they are all right and so we'll watch this over you can see from the high it's down about 82 percent uh year to date it is up 82 percent so there you go I like coinbase and I believe the crypto industry will continue to absolutely explode moving forward especially once we get through quantitative tightening the money comes the the Fed rate comes down money gets cheaper people are throwing money everywhere we got a record amount of money on the sidelines right now outside of equities all I can see is crypto and equities especially some of these high growth just exploding higher once we get through this period of uncertainty such as the recession the FED tightening so once the FED finally gets into quantitative easing this is one of the stocks I think is going to explode up let's take a look at the price predictions out there and this is you can see these are top analysts on Wall Street they average them together and you can see they have the Sofi price prediction 26 percent up now I absolutely love this I have the stock Mo patreon you can come over and check that out I'll be adding certain stocks when I'm buying and selling over there you can find that then the next of the best stocks to buy now of course we got DraftKings 24.52 percent upside potential according to the top analysts on Wall Street the next pollen tier 30 downside watch it if you think the top analysts know what they're talking about you stay away from this one now me personally I still like it I think it has potential that's up to you uh but I'm just showing you what the analysts think the next we have Tesla they believe this has a huge 1.64 upside potential over the next 24 or the next 12 months I don't agree with that of course I think it's going to go much higher but you can look at it and coinbase they have a 3.73 downside projection for the coinbase price prediction over the next 12 months something to watch guys there is a lot of things going on out there with these stocks listen these are gross stocks I've shown you value stocks I've shown you dividend stocks now I'm showing you the five growth stocks I really like right now and so far is probably going to be one of the bigger ones I buy in the near future I already have Tesla but I like so far right now and I gotta tell you I feel like loading the boat with that one if you'd like to see exactly what and when and when all that up to the moment you can come over the patreon links down below or join on the channel I still will bring to the family here on YouTube eventually so don't worry about it I'll let you know down the road when I pulled that trigger but for those who want to support the channel and you'll want to know up to the minute that's how you can

from its lows over the past six months and I am going to explain my thoughts on this business and what I think that it is saying about the overall Market this stock is AI and right here we can see that the stock became public in 2020 at a share price of about 92. it then ran about 70 percent over the next year but from this peak right here it is now down about 74 and at the bottom here it was down 94 if we want to round up however if we zoom in here we can see that the stock bottomed in December of 2022 and now again the stock is up about 300 percent from those lows now in June of 2023. this stock has been running absolutely massively but it is down to 13 on the day today after it just reported its earnings for the first quarter so I went through the company's earnings and I took some screenshots that I want to share with all of you because I think that this is just kind of insane so this is the company's in income statement right here we can see that the total revenue did grow slightly year over year to about 72.4 million dollars from 72.3 million dollars last year so essentially the revenue is flat year over year yes it did grow slightly but I'm just going to say that it's basically flat however we can see that the cost of Revenue is now up to 24.9 a million dollars up from 17.4 million of last year so the cost of Revenue has increased by seven million dollars year over year which is significant with the revenue remaining flat and the cost of Revenue up significantly this means that the gross profit is down about 8 million dollars a year over year to about 47.5 million so this company's gross profit is declining with the cost going up we can also see here that the total operating expenses were 120.8 million up about 9 million dollars year over year which ultimately means that the loss on operations declined to 73.3 million which is down at almost 20 million dollars a year over year lastly on the income statement here we can see that the diluted shares outstanding is now sitting at 112.7 million up from 105 Million last year so the shares outstanding have increased by about six percent year over year which means that the company is in fact diluting shareholders now moving on to the next screenshot this is the cash flow statement and we can see right here that the stock based compensation expense is now sitting at 216.5 million dollars in the trailing 12 months this has nearly doubled year over year so insiders of this business are making a record amount of money while the business's revenue is not growing and the expenses are continuing to go up which ultimately means that the profits are going down so profits are going one way but the the compensation that insiders are getting is going a totally opposite direction and it nearly doubled and this is a massive amount of stock based compensation this is almost the entire amount of the company's Revenue it's pretty insane we can also see right here that the net cash used in operating activities declined to 116 million negative 116 million from negative 86 Million last year at the same time the purchases of property plant and equipment or the capex declined by about 70 million dollars a year over year so the cash flow that this business is generating or the cash flow that it is losing has increased significantly year over year and this company is burning hundreds of millions of dollars almost 200 million dollars in the trailing 12 months now and whenever a company is losing money like this what I like to do is ask myself how is it staying in business and where is the company getting money because every single business needs cash because cash Is Like Oxygen for Business Without cash you cannot pay your employees you cannot keep the lights on and you cannot meet your business expenses so where is it coming from well right here we can see that the maturities and sales of Investments for this year were about 876 million dollars and last year they were 1.1 billion so how this company is staying in business is it is selling off its Investments to raise money and keep the lights on and we can see right here that the net cash provided by investing activities was 60 million dollars of this year and 317 Million last year so again that is how how the company is staying in business is slowly selling off its Investments and its Assets Now at the bottom of the cash flow statement here we can see that the net decrease in cash this year was 55 million dollars whereas last year it was 236 million so now if we go to the company's balance sheet we can see that the cash and cash equivalents this year have declined by about 50 million and the short-term Investments have declined by about 160 or 180 million ultimately this means that the total current assets have declined by about 200 million dollars year over year and slowly this company's cash is in fact running out now lastly I went over to the company's investor presentation for their most recent quarter and this is what they have to say and while we're reading this keep in mind that this company's revenue is not growing its expenses are growing the management is paying themselves a massive amount of stock based compensation and the company is losing more money than ever before right now now let's take a look at this slide from their their most recent quarter huge addressable Market of nearly 800 billion dollars by 2026 they have a first mover advantage they have patented Enterprise and AI application platform substantial Market partner ecosystem recognized AI Market leadership proven track record of success veteran discipline management team high performance corporate culture and excellence in execution so they're basically saying that their total addressable Market is 800 billion dollars over the next just three years so this is a massive Market that they are in and they have a first mover advantage and they're executing well here's the thing is if the overall AI Market is expanding and growing massively right now then this company not growing its sales actually means that they are losing massive amounts of market share and they're not really executing it that well they may have a high performance corporate culture and a veteran disciplined management team but the company's profits are going completely the wrong direction the company is losing more money than ever and the management is really making more money than ever at the same time so let's head back over to stock unlock and we're going to take a look at this company's income statement and very clearly right here the green bars are the revenue that the company generates and then the bars beside that red bars are the expenses or the costs for the company we can see that the overall trend here and the trailing 12 months is that the company's Revenue isn't really growing but its expenses continue growing quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter and it continues losing more and more money if we also head over to the balance sheet here and take a look at the company's total cash we can see that it peaked here in the first quarter of 2021 at 1.1 billion and ever since then every single quarter it has been losing money this is because the company is in fact losing money and it's burning through its cash position to stay in business which is exactly what we saw with the cash flow statement as well now if we also go and take a look at the recent Insider transactions there has been absolutely no buys there is no buys on the list of drop downs here on stock unlock so let's take a look at the cells and when we scroll down we can see that insiders are consistently selling off their shares large blocks of shares are being sold and no insiders ever buy this stock and all of the selling is going on all of this selling this whole entire page of selling is just within the last year back to June of 2022 so over the past year insiders seemed like they were selling off massive amount of shares and this is why the stock was declining as well this is why the stock was down like 90 from its all-time highs this is not what I'd like to see personally in management teams I like to see management buy more shares while the stock is falling and basically in all of the businesses that I own especially in smaller cap companies like this I really focus on the management team how effective are they and are they continuing to buy the shares while it's going down and I also like to see them have large positions in the stocks that I own this is not the case with AI right here so basically what I think is going on is AI stock is running massively one because its ticker symbol is AI and with all of the AI hype going on in the market right now clearly this stock is probably going to get a boost with its you know ticker symbol being AI but overall I think that the artificial intelligence wave is really being hyped up right now and it's being hyped up to the point where companies like this with very poor fundamentals are now Skyrocket 300 from their lows and even just in like the past month this stock is up 150 percent now so my warning to investors in the market is if you do want to ride this AI hype wave then just be careful and really pay attention to the fundamentals of the stocks that you are buying yeah it's very exciting to get you know involved in this hype with these stocks being so volatile and clearly people can make a lot of money very quickly if you know how to ride the hype but if you are a long-term investor and you're planning on holding these stocks then again please make sure that you are buying fundamentally sound businesses because when there is this massive hype wave in the AI sector or in any sector that is currently being hyped up the entire sector gets lifted up even the crappy companies and the the companies that do not have strong fundamentals and you can kind of be you know swayed or excited or if you react to emotion you can buy some pretty poorly fundamental stocks in fact if we head over to stock unlock insights we can actually see that this company right here has an stock unlock Insight score of 2.47 which is bad we can see that the Financial Health is good the company does have 43 months left of Runway the current ratio is 7.6 and it has no debt so the overall Financial Health is good it is diluting by about five percent year over year though as we saw however the growth score is only 1.88 the revenue did increase but operating income net income operating cash flow free cash flow Book value and tangible Book value are all going down so the overall growth score is 1.88 the profitability score is also 1.71 which is pretty bad the gross margin is high but the operating margin is negative 102 because the Insiders are paying themselves so much money and their salaries and their stock based compensation is ridiculously high net margin is negative 100 free cash flow margin negative 81 percent it's unprofitable and it's free cash flow negative it lost 218 million dollars in the trillion 12 months also if we scroll down the returns are as low as they can get at one roic negative 43 roce negative 28 and then valuation looks pretty bad right now overall the company has a strong balance sheet but every other metric here is looking pretty dang bad which is why the score is so low and using stock unlock you can very quickly see that this company doesn't have that strong of fundamentals just by taking a look at our stock unlock Insight scores this is a very good scoring system by the way and it really does a good job of scoring the fundamentals and the financials of any business so if you're interested and you want to take a look at your own stocks come to stock unlock you can use it for totally free and you can come and see all the Insight scores of your businesses and avoid some pretty crappy companies like AI in my opinion but overall that is what I am seeing in the market I'm seeing a lot of hype out there and I'm seeing a lot of these AI stocks get pumped up quite a bit even the stocks that I do think are fundamentally sound like in video with a really strong balance sheet growing their cash flow really well growing Revenue really well even those stocks are getting quite expensive in fact let's go and take a look at Nvidia really quickly it's going to take a look at its price to free cash flow now and let's zoom out all the way back here to 2010 10. so right now Nvidia is selling for a price to free cash flow of about 183 and this is the most expensive that the stock has ever been even back here in about 2021 November of 2021 price of free cash will go out to about 114. the reason that Nvidia is priced to free cash flow is so much higher now is because the company's free cash flow is actually declining while the stock price is hitting all-time highs this double whammy means that the stock is now trading for a price to free cash flow of 183 and that is a that is a massive massive massive price to pay let's take a look at the company's free cash flow right now because it is currently sitting at about 5 billion dollars what is the market cap the market cap of this business now is about 1 trillion right 934 million so for NVIDIA to even sell for a price to free cash flow of 20. it would have to produce 46.5 billion dollars in free cash flow divide this by five which is about 10 times or nine times the amount of free cash flow that the company is producing so for NVIDIA to trade for a price to free cash flow of 20 which is a 5 free cash yield it would have to nearly 10x its cash flow in its only 12 months that is how expensive the stock is that is how much future growth is being priced into the stock now seriously everyone just be careful because it seems like anything that is involved with artificial intelligence or is in the AI sector is being pumped to the freaking moon right now even Microsoft Microsoft is trading for a price to free cash flow of something like 43 now I believe let's take a look price to free cash flow of Microsoft is now about 42.5 it's come down a little bit this is a very very high price ratio for a company that's worth two trillion dollars and its revenue is not really growing that quickly and its free cash flow is not really growing that quickly I understand that Microsoft is a fantastic business it's an incredible business it's almost guaranteed to continue growing in the future but at some point you have to sit down and ask yourself how much future growth is already being priced into this stock it's literally trading at its highest price ratio in the past 20 years even all the way back here in 2003 it had a price to free cash flow of about 26. so it's literally trading for a record high price ratios right now which is making me less optimistic that these stocks are going to produce strong returns going forward there's just a lot of hype in the AI sector it's bringing up all these stocks and just be careful everyone that's all I'm going to say I am not buying these stocks that I think are looking very expensive and I am not riding this AI wave I do own Google which is kind of benefiting from all of this but Google is still kind of training for it's it's trading for about fair value now if we go and take a quick look at Google's price to free cash flow Google is now trading for a price to free cash flow of about 25 and if we take a look at the average over the past decade it's been about 28 so it's actually still selling below its historical averages and even right here during the stock market crash 2020 got down to about 23. so it isn't really that expensive relative to its historical averages but it is probably trading somewhere around fair value now but overall again I think I made my point pretty clear that's kind of what I wanted to come on here and say very quickly today just be careful everyone there's a lot of crap companies being lifted up in this AI hype wave that we're seeing and a lot of these stocks are getting very expensive so please again just be careful that's gonna wrap up the video today

obsessing over the Federal Reserve economic data remains lackluster and economists are split on whether the Federal Reserve will hike again during their June meeting or whether a pause is in order regardless it is evident that we are nearing the end of this rate hike cycle however is the recession imminent not necessarily the labor force remains stable although consumers are beginning to weaken based on record U.S credit card debt levels and low savings rate that also show the average American Savings that have been largely wiped away since the pandemic so with all that being said it's 50 50 on whether we fall into a recession the Market's favorite recession indicator happens to be the inversion of the yield curve meaning the two-year treasury bond is higher than the 10-year treasury bond which has now been the case for over 220 consecutive days with all that being said if you don't know by now what we do on this channel is consistently scan box for great long-term entry points we're not buying for a five percent Pop tomorrow although that would be nice we are looking for high quality stocks at great valuations as such in today's video we are going to take a look at five of the best dividend stocks to buy in the month of June but before we begin if you could do me a huge favor and click that like button down below subscribe to the channel it would be greatly appreciated go ahead I'll wait for you all right thank you let's get started [Music] hey everyone Mark rusen here back for another video as always I'm a CPA and not a financial advisor so please perform your own due diligence and do not take this as Financial advice and before we begin let me take a quick moment to thank today's video sponsor which is the Motley Fool The Motley Fool has a ton of great resources tools and products for investors of all the different levels and right now if you go to full.com forward slash mark you could sign up to receive their 10 best stocks to buy right now completely free all right let's take a look at our five best dividend stocks to buy in the month of June beginning with dividend stock number one which is Qualcomm stock ticker q c o m Qualcomm is a carryover from last month's top picks and although they struggled after reporting their quarterly earnings they have gained back much of that in the last few days Qualcomm has a market cap of 129 billion dollars over the past 12 months the stock is down at 19 but year to date it is up eight percent if you keep up with the market in any capacity then you're probably well aware of the AI craze that is taken over in 2023 look at stocks like Nvidia and meta platforms which have doubled here just in the year 2023 we're talking about we're only five months in and then a competitor of Qualcomm which is broadcom stock ticker avgo a stock that I hold within my dividend portfolio is up 45 year-to-date but Qualcomm has been left behind why is that number one the recovery in China has been a lot slower than many had expected at the end of last year China reopened completely taking away their covet zero restrictions but many companies baked in a lot of growth expectations with the reopening of China that just hasn't come to fruition yet secondly handset sales are down across the globe down 17 percent for Qualcomm alone when the company reported their Q2 earnings they were actually in line from an EPS standpoint and they beat on sales but the company also gave pretty light guidance EPS came in at 2.15 sense which I mentioned was inline revenues for the quarter came in at 9.28 billion and analysts were expecting 9.1 billion there's the beat on revenues but in terms of guidance Q3 sales are expected to come in at 8.5 but the street was looking for 9.14 billion and EPS guidance also came in light at a dollar eighty when analysts were looking for 2.16 per share definitely some huge gaps there between analysts and management Qualcomm also had negative cash flow during the quarter as their cash position decreased by 1.3 billion however they remain cash flow positive on the year thus far in terms of free cash flow Qualcomm generated 3.7 billion in free cash flow through the first half of the year compared to paying out dividends of 1.7 billion which equates to a free cash flow yield of 46 percent which tells me the dividend is plenty safe at the moment speaking of the dividend Qualcomm pays an annual dividend that yields 2.9 percent and over the past five years investors have seen the company increase the dividend and an average of 5.2 percent per year so not a ton in terms of dividend growth although the last two hikes have been above the average rate which is positive now for valuation analysts are looking for FY 2024 adjusted EPS of 9.57 cents per share which equates to an earnings multiple of 12.1 times for comparative purposes over the past five years shares of Qualcomm have traded at an average earnings multiple of 17.1 times and over the past decade closer to 15.7 times the second dividend stock on our list today is Johnson and Johnson stock ticker J and J now many of you are already well aware of the company Johnson and Johnson but there has been some changes within the company over the past few months the company rolled off its consumer health segment into a completely new and separate public company called can view which trades under the stock ticker KVUE so the new Johnson and Johnson still has the pharmaceutical segment as well as the Medtech segment moving forward to give you an idea on how big each of these segments are here's a look at the company's recent quarterly results which shows consumer health accounted for 15 percent of company revenues the med tech segment coming in at 30 percent of company revenues and the Pharmaceuticals segment by far the largest of the company comes in at 55 percent of company revenues Johnson Johnson has long been a major player within the pharmaceutical industry and they have a ton of great products that are already out to Market but they also have a very strong pipeline coming down the line the medical device segment also known as Medtech is also expected to return to growth after taking a breather during those pandemic years Johnson Johnson currently has a market cap of 401 billion dollars over the past 12 months the stock is down 14 percent and year to date it is down 13 percent in fact Shares are trading very close to their 52-week low giving investors a great opportunity to add to this Healthcare conglomerate we are talking about a company that has a safer credit rating than the US government if that's saying anything in terms of the dividend Johnson Johnson has paid a growing dividend for more than 60 consecutive years the company currently yields a dividend of 3.1 percent and they have a five-year dividend growth rate of 5.7 percent with the stock trading near the 52-week low let's take a look at where that puts the company's valuation analysts are looking for 2023 EPS of 10.65 cents per share which equates to a 2023 earnings multiple of 14.5 times for comparative purposes Johnson Johnson has traded at an average multiple of 17.7 times over the past five years and 17.2 times over the past decade making now an opportune time to add to jnj the third dividend stock on our list today is United Healthcare Group stock ticker UNH United Healthcare is another carryover from our May picks as the stock really didn't move all that much in the last month which is giving us another up opportunity to dip our toes into this great stock for those of you that are unaware the Dow Jones Industrial Average is actually a price weighted index unlike the S P 500 which is weighted based on market caps the Dow Jones Industrial is price weighted meaning per share price actually matters and the company with the largest waiting meaning the highest stock price per share is United Health Group it currently has a market cap of 447 billion dollars and over the past 12 months the stock is down three and a half percent and year-to-date they are down seven and a half percent so really just stuck in idle of late United Healthcare is a behemoth in the health care sector contributing 7.7 percent of U.S health care spending today from their United Healthcare and Optum segments Piper Sandler recently initiated coverage on the stock giving it an overweight rating which is a fancy way of calling it a buy they gave the stock a 12-month price target of 580 which implies 21 upside from current levels the average price Target on the street is 595 dollars per share actually higher which implies 24 upside from current levels UNH currently yields a dividend of 1.4 percent which is not all that much but the Intriguing part from a dividend standpoint is the 17 5-year dividend growth rate the company has UNH has increased their dividend for 13 consecutive years in terms of valuation analysts are looking for 2023 EPS of 24.95 per share which equates to a 2023 earnings multiple of 19.2 times for comparative purposes UNH shares have traded at an average multiple of 21.5 times over the past five years and 19.4 times over the past decade dividend stock number four is a T stock ticker T I know I know this one could be a little controversial and I have owned a t in the past but luckily I got out of it prior to the pandemic plunge I got out around the low 30 limit but I had my reasons for selling and I'm not someone that sells stocks all that often but if something changes fundamentally within the business then I will look at selling it and that's exactly what happened with at T they went from this Telecom Giant and they wanted to get more involved in with DirecTV the overpaying for DirecTV and then want to getting more into media overpaying for Warner media but under the new leadership of CEO John Stanky he has gotten rid of those Acquisitions and returned to the roots of what made at T the Telecom giant that it once was 5G continues its rollout and there's a huge role for all of the Telecom Giants to play and to take part in so know this going in there's still a lot of risks with the company there could still be volatility they still have a huge mountain of debt to work out and they still have Fierce competition with the likes of Verizon and T-Mobile at T currently has a market cap of 112 billion dollars over the past 12 months the stock is down 26 and year to date they are down 16 percent in recent weeks when the 13f filings came out which shows what stocks hedge funds are buying and selling in the last quarter there was a lot of names on the list that showed positions being initiated or added to for a t one of those was billionaire owner of the New York Mets Stephen Cohen of 0.72 Asset Management who added over 9 million shares of at t a completely new position Ken Griffin of Citadel advisors added 27 million shares in the last quarter alone ATT has long been known for their high yield dividend but last year the company decided to slash the dividend by nearly 50 percent deciding to take that cash to reinvest back into the business and also pay down debt however the dividend yield is still high at 7.2 percent and because of the dividend cut there is no dividend growth at the moment now for valuation analysts are looking for adjusted EPS of 2.41 in 2023 which equates to a 2023 earnings multiple of 6 0.5 times that is incredibly low for comparable purposes over the past five years shares have traded at an average multiple of nearly 12 times and 15.1 times over the past decade if you can believe that making a t a low floor play at these levels the fifth and final stock on our list today is Tyson Foods stock ticker TSN Tyson Foods is a major food player here in the US that has come under intense pressure over the past year and especially lately after a poor earnings result the company has a market cap of 18 billion dollars and over the past 12 months the stock is down over 40 percent year-to-date Tyson Foods Shares are down 18 that is a nasty chart to look at to say the least concerns around the company have been due to Rising costs which have eaten into profit margins no pun intended but the inflationary environment that we're in is definitely taking a toll on Tyson Foods part of the reason for the decline is due in part to the last two years being some of the best years for the company looking at this chart you can see the company's share price rise from the summer of 2020 to new highs in the winter and spring of 2022 but since then it has been falling and falling fast with the latest quarter being the final straw for investors as the stock fell more than 15 percent after earnings the Tyson Food management company completely understands this and they're trying to get their costs under control at the same time they've been investing and becoming more efficient both through digital as well as automation which should definitely start showing through the results in the years to come knowing this as well as seeing the full-fledged sell-off that we saw in the shares in recent weeks is another example of a company that has a lower floor there's been a flush out that we've seen in recent weeks which gives me an idea knowing that there's cost cut measures coming and this company can definitely turn things around tells me this is a low floor play for Tyson Foods TSN shares currently yield a dividend of 3.7 percent with a five-year dividend growth rate of roughly 10 percent management has also increased the dividend for 11 consecutive years and counting in terms of valuation with the stock selling off hard recently shares of TSN now trade at an FY 2024 earnings multiple of 14.9 times which is not all that great considering their 5 and 10 year averages are 11 and 12 times respectively however we know the cost cutting measures are underway and there's profit challenges in the near term but assuming the company can get back to pre-pandemic EPS levels which is not all that crazy if you ask me then we are talking about a stock trading in the single digits TSN is definitely a name that you want to add to your watch list so there we have it folks five stocks to consider for your portfolio your dividend portfolio in the month of June it's an array of all different types of stocks you have Qualcomm who hasn't really partook in the AI craze yet you also have Tyson Foods and at T that look like low floor plays they still have some headwinds and they may have a little bit of volatility but the entry point it's right here look very intriguing and then you have two conglomerates you have United Health Group and Johnson Johnson which are leaders in their respective Industries in the comments section down below let

on the day but let's go out a month guys this one was down 12 this type of pullback leads for a great entry if you guys want to dollar cost average into something like a Exxon Mobil a high quality Energy play okay again from a long-term perspective this is one that from a cyclical standpoint when the market is in flux you will have times where Commodities such as energy and weed and things like that are going up you want to have this as part of the fault matter of fact let's go ahead and take a look at some of the financials on this looking at the quarterly financials Revenue was down a tad bit down four percent but their net income was up over a hundred percent okay the diluted EPS was up almost 120 percent net profit margin was almost up 120 percent and their operating income was up over 50 percent nearly 60 percent okay guys the net cash was down 29.5 and the cost of Revenue was also down they beat on EPS in March they missed on Revenue okay however Exxon one of the best in class in terms of an energy play that you might want to have as part do the mix inside of your portfolio Okay you can also play this by getting The XLE all right but with that being said this will be a part of the mix this will be getting added as long as it's under a hundred and five dollars so down here is definitely your buy if it touches 100 or goes below like 99.97 I will have to back up the Brinks truck and load the boat on this one and route to it returning to that 120 level okay do me that favor add this one to your watch list next guys we got palantir ticker symbol pltr this one is sitting at 14.28 this one down on the day okay nothing to write home about on the week it is up eight and a half percent on the month though it is up 84 this is a double up for some people depending on where you got in that however this one has more room to run but don't rule out a pullback which equals a great entry into something like this that it will continue as a long-term play to trench higher and higher okay again don't rule out this stock touching twenty dollars sometime next year if not sooner however do not avoid buying and dollar cost averaging into something like this when it is at these low prices under 15 at ten dollars that's seven dollars that's six dollars and things like that building out your position for the long term and making sure that you keep the right perspective on this type of company as it will be one of the major players in the future okay matter of fact do me a favor let me know down in the comments below if you have palantir if it's a long-term hold for you and how many shares of this do you have okay this is a great one just want to make sure it's part of your mix all right taking a look at the financials on this one guys the revenue was up 17.6 percent the net income on this is up over 115 percent on this the diluted EP yes is a hundred and twenty percent check out this net profit margin okay this is kind of things you want to see in companies you want to invest in for the long term okay up a hundred and fourteen percent the operating income is up a hundred and ten percent okay the cost of Revenue is 14 the net change in cash look at this guys and then they be on eps and they beat on Revenue in March 2020 in their last reported okay I'm just putting these fundamentals on your radar as well so that you have the story from a technical standpoint as well as a fundamental standpoint of why we're even looking and considering palantir for the month of June all right and then guys we have Tesla ticker symbol TSLA this one is currently sitting at 203.75 this one is set to break out okay I expect this to see at least 215 in the month of June okay and so I will be closely watching this on pullbacks I'll continue to trade this and make a killing off of this each and every day throughout the month of June Tesla okay check it out guys we at 203 if we can clear some of these levels and get back to 207 210 there's no question why we can't test that 215 potentially 220 level in this that's what I'll be looking for at some point throughout the month of June okay despite it possibly having to pull back a little bit check it out on the week it is up nearly 10 percent it had a high of 204. I've been calling these levels out in the Discord for things you guys want to look out for I'm looking for our next test to be at 205 matter of fact I'll be looking and watching that like a hawk as soon as it do we going crazy okay but on the month this one was up 25 all right I can see it going a little bit higher before it needs to pull back so that higher for me equals around 215 ish we had a lot of resistance a lot of sellers waiting for us at 217 the last time we visited that level so for me guys I'll be looking for at least a test of 215 and if potentially knowing Tesla I wouldn't be surprised if we test 220 those are my levels for the month of June however this is a great long-term hold despite any of these short-term moves okay so as it goes lower and you see this as a great AI play a great Energy play a great Tech play a great EV play you build out your position you accumulate and buy more shares when this is at lower prices okay and then last one not least is a dark horse I want to put in your radar c3ai if this one can recapture some of its magic and get back above 35 to 38 dollars don't rule out this one potentially going to fifty dollars okay with that being said this is a dark horse so again just put this one on your watch list for now I'll revisit this one if we can get this one back in and around this 19 20 Level that's where I would like it at for myself personally if I'm going to play this at all alright with that being said let me know if you've made money with c3ai or any of these players we talked about or if you plan on adding them as part of the mix for the month of June listen guys the market is always evolving it's always a fluid vehicle guys so listen I want you to be on your p's and q's I want you to use everything we teach on a daily basis in terms of managing your risks in terms of for putting your stop losses on in terms of doing all that you need to do because some of these plays are conservative some of these plays are higher risk okay I'm gonna show up every day walk you guys through what I'm doing and I want to hear all about more importantly what you guys are doing with that being said guys if you ready to make some money this particular month the way we Crush may we should do the same thing for June all right with that being said we make videos like this every day so if you like this one make sure you check out the next one remember most people see the end result there if you consider the journey so do me a favor don't forget to like subscribe to the channel make sure you guys grab some free so I can use my link below and I'll catch you guys in the next one peace

to predict everything the stock market's going to do in the future look if anyone tells you that never believe them they're probably just trying to sell you one of those courses for 997 dollars so even though there's no magic ball that can tell you when to buy a stock before it rockets in value and makes you a millionaire overnight there is certainly a few things i do to tip the odds in my favor and that's what i'd like to share with you guys today as i've got older and slightly grayer i've found that knowing the reason behind why i stopped my changing prices helped me make and save a lot of money if you're new to the stock market then a stock is a small part of a company and when you buy you actually become a part owner the idea is to buy parts of a company that you believe will go up in value so you're able to multiply your money without doing any extra work but let's face it investing in the stock market can be pretty confusing and most people just pick companies on a whim however that's not how i do it so by the end of this video you'll know my actual strategies for picking great stocks and don't worry i won't be trying to sell you anything so you can just sit back and relax so there are two main ways to attempt to predict the stock market these are called technical and fundamental analysis a good way to think about this is like a scale usually short-term day traders are purely focused on technical aspects these include looking at charts and patterns they believe that they can predict how the stock will change in price by judging the highs and the lows on the graphs they're the geeky ones nah i'm only kidding it's just not how i do it my whole investment strategy is about keeping it simple lots of people talk about using margin and options but that's really not something i worry about i'm a long-term investor so this means i'm a lot more focused on the fundamentals of a company this includes the financials the leadership and the brand recognition as i believe this is where the information lies to indicate the long-term success of a stock however like i mentioned it's a scale so i do cast my eye over the occasional chart in order to find the best time to buy this approach has helped me to find some really good investments over the years rather than just dipping in and out and trying to make a profit on a daily basis the amazing thing is the majority of professional traders are still unable to be a low-cost index fund over the long term this may sound quite complicated but it's actually very simple so this bucket represents an individual stock and the water is me pumping all of my money into that company this represents an index fund each cup being a different company and the water i'm putting in is the money i'm spreading between each of them in one easy investment for whatever reason if this company goes bankrupt then guess what or my money goes down the drain now this is the same company and it still goes bankrupt but the good thing is i may lose my money in that small investment however i've got so many more stocks and i've done really well in some of them which means i've actually made a profit overall my favorite index funds track the s p 500 which are the top 500 public companies in the usa so even though the majority of my money goes into index fund investing i also have a lot of fun picking individual stocks and watching my portfolio grow on this note if you'd like an easy way to get started public are currently giving away a free stock worth all the way up to 50 dollars when you fund your account if you want to pick that up i'll leave a link in the description and if you're in the uk free trade are giving away a free stock that could be worth up to 200 pound when you deposit as little as two pounds i'll leave that link below as well it's a great way to get started with individual stocks and basically it's free money right so now you've got your free stock and you're ready to invest into some more but where should you start well if you're anything like me it makes sense to start with the numbers we call this quantitative analysis whenever i'm thinking about investing in a company i make sure to look at all these figures first if the financials don't look good to me then it's very rare that i do any further research into the company it's kind of like when you go on a first date with someone and they seem really nice however it isn't until you really start getting to know all the details about them that you might start to notice their flaws like eating with their mouth open or picking their nose if only they gave you a non-biased comprehensive list of how they actually are so you can make an educated decision whether you want to date them or not i don't have a solution to this problem but luckily that's exactly what companies do it's brilliant you can find out this information for free on yahoo finance which is the website that i use there are three main aspects that i look at first let's break down the balance sheet i know it doesn't sound too interesting but trust me this is where you find some of the real juicy information the whole purpose of this sheet is in the name to balance assets and liabilities think of it a bit like this you may own a watch or a rental property and these are your assets but let's say you have loads of credit card debt this is one of your liabilities so let's break down some of the gobbledygook terms so you can easily understand this complicated looking sheet and impress your friends assets are broken down into three categories current assets are things that could be turned into cash within 12 months longer term assets are things like their headquarters which they usually don't sell in a hurry companies can also have assets that you can't physically touch known as non-tangible assets such as the brand recognition of an established business that has been trusted for generations i like to think of coca-cola and then we come to the liabilities and what i'm really interested in here are the current liabilities as this is the debt that they'll need to repay within 12 months with this there is a simple calculation you can do to easily know if the company is high risk or not and that is total current assets divided by total current liabilities a good rule of thumb here is the number should be above one but how does this work in practice let's take apple's balance sheet for example apple's total current assets divided by their total current liability comes to 1.4 when rounded up this is great as now we know that apple are able to pay off all their short-term debt nearly one and a half times the second document that's really important to have a look at is the income statement if you've ever heard the saying of the top and bottom line this is where it comes from at the top of the statement this is the total revenue which is the total the business take and at the bottom is the net income which is the money the company makes after all the expenses have been deducted every business has these expenses the cost of operation and the cost of revenue so let's take a simple business like a smoothie company their cost of revenue is fruit they can't make the smoothies without buying that therefore that is a cost they have no choice about it's a simple fact of running their business but the next thing they do have a choice about which is their operating expenses who they're hiring and what kind of wages that they're paying them after these expenses are deducted from the total amount of money they take from their customers you get the operating income so here's my simple calculation that lets me know if the business is healthy operating income divided by total revenue times 100 ideally i look for above 15 using apple again let's take this number divided by this number and we get 27 which is great the last one of the big three is the statement of cash flow i'm not going to spend too much time on this one as when you boil it down it's pretty simple the main thing i look out for is if the company i'm investing in has increase in free cash flow year on year which is money they can use to reinvest or pay back to investors a big red flag here is sometimes i see the cash flow is negative but the company is still paying dividends back to its investors it's just unsustainable and eventually the business is just going to run out of cash now once i've had a good look at all these numbers it's time to get into the juicy stuff and that's all about analyzing the qualities of a company this is known as qualitative analysis one of the qualities i look for is brand recognition when i say the word apple most people think about the company rather than the fruit i know i keep referring to it but it's a great example of amazing brand recognition that won't be going away anytime soon being a household brand name comes with a lot of consumer trust so when they launch a new product people are much more likely to try it out especially if it's something unique or groundbreaking such as the ipad and we like to show it to you today for the first time and we call it the ipad this helps companies like apple shape our future and create entire new markets and revenue streams another great example of brand awareness is coca-cola it's the second most recognized word in the world after okay something that really affects price movements is the news i always keep an eye on it and in particular rumors on social media you may have heard about the whole gamestop situation where a small bunch of retail investors managed to outsmart the top hedge funds by finding a flaw in their strategy they were able to use this to their advantage and earn a lot of money tonight it's wall street's david versus goliath the struggling video game retailer gamestop skyrocketing about 8 000 percent over six months but once the news broke and more people started to jump onto the bandwagon the big profits had already been made this is a great example of the age old saying buy the rumor sell the news i learned this valuable lesson during the dot-com boom in the 90s when i started investing people were amazed that i was pouring money into companies whose main asset was a dot-com domain name however within six months it seemed that everyone's telling me that they were buying shares in dot-com companies even my hairdresser i decided to start selling to buy more real estate just weeks before the bubble burst and i managed to save the majority of my profits others weren't so lucky everyone thought that internet businesses were the future and they were eventually right however most of the original companies never recovered and i saw some of my friends make millions just to lose 90 percent of their investment when everything crashed only a handful of companies managed to weather the storm such as amazon this showed me that the hype generated by the news and other people talking about it really just caused the prices to get out of control and become unsustainable so whenever i feel like hype is driving the price of a particular stock i know that it probably isn't a great long-term investment although with the dot-com bubble it is true that a lot of companies did rebound eventually the next important factor is the leadership of the company even more so nowadays with social media and what the leaders say is having a huge effect on the price of the stock a prime example of this is elon musk who is very clearly the visionary behind all of his companies one of them of course being tesla just imagine if elon musk decided he was bored of making electric cars and tweeted that he was standing down from tesla to focus on spacex and his mission to colonize mars i think this reliance on elon musk is one of tesla's greatest strengths but also one of its greatest weaknesses as the company is highly affected by his actions this brings me to my next point which is to look out for emerging future industries like electric vehicle technology which tesla is leading the way in these types of investments are really your growth stocks my friend simon squibb often tells me he believes that in the future doctors will be replaced by artificial intelligence this sounds like the stuff of science fiction however when i was younger this was what i used to see on star trek spark spark here in fact this is even better i actually first heard of tesla when it was featured on top gear in 2008 it wasn't a very flattering review as they showed the car running out of batteries in 50 miles which was only a quarter of the advertised range elon wasn't very happy about this and he actually later filed a lawsuit against the show however the segment certainly piqued my interest and i could see they were onto something during my time investing i've seen a huge shift in each sector or if you're american at home sectors let me take you back to when i was younger if you can imagine that far back i remember sitting at my grandma's house and watching this guy come along with a sack of coal on his back which he would deliver to my grandma so she could heat her house nowadays most people use gas so no more mr coleman and this sector is all set to change again with the introduction of renewable electricity but that's three major shifts that i'll experience in my lifetime if i'd been stuck in my ways and not taking notice of these changes then my investments would have been left in the past just like the coal industry so before investing in a stock i always think about whether a future shift in sector will have a positive or negative impact on that company but how do i predict when the best time to buy is you don't but there's a strategy i use to get around this and it's called dollar cost averaging let's imagine you were to invest once a month for three months month one the stock might cost you two hundred dollars month two hundred and fifty dollars a month three hundred and thirty dollars of course if you knew it was going to dip to 130 you'd have bought then however no one knows how low the price will go but by doing this instead of investing all your money in month one when your stock was at 200 you actually lower your average buying price to 160 dollars this is also known as buying the dip instead of getting scared and selling like the majority of people would the idea is to buy more because it's like having a garage sale and if you've done all your research and you like the company then the stock is at a bargain price so i'm going to leave the next video right up there but don't click on it just yet make sure to subscribe for more videos and pick up your free stocks with the links below okay i'll see

guys saw from my last video once again it is 13f season so in this video we're going to be looking at the five most bought Stocks by our 77 super investors in q1 of 2023 as of course tracked by Dart Aroma now before we get started right at the top of the video I do just want to say that with videos like these please remember that these five businesses are not stock recommendations they don't create a shopping list for us as value investors remember like I always say this is just an ideas list for us to potentially explore further in our own time but with that said let's Roll that list up on screen and let's have a bit of a look at which stocks are taking our super investors fancy in q1 of 2023. foreign and we start with the fifth most bought stock by our super investors in q1 it was Intuit so overall we saw seven super investors Buy in during the quarter so what do they do well Intuit is a provider of financial management software to small and medium-sized businesses but you'll probably recognize them more from the brands that they own Turbo Tax Credit Karma QuickBooks and MailChimp they divide themselves up into four key Revenue segments although the business is really carried by two of them that being small business and self-employed which is QuickBooks and MailChimp and consumer which is Turbo Tax so accounting software for small business and tax return help for consumers and combined these segments make up about 80 percent of their revenue and the bulk of their segment operating income too so clearly the super investors see something in this space but honestly I'm not sure I quite understand the thesis because to me it seems like the business faces more macroeconomic headwinds than Tailwinds over the next few years Rising interest rates will obviously hurt most parts of business but particularly will hit their Credit Karma business and if unemployment starts to rise that will only hurt their Turbo Tax business even the IRS itself is currently reporting a declining number of filed tax returns year over year after they saw that huge pandemic surge of 10 million extra filed returns as the prior year tax returns were the determinant of the size of your stimulus check so there are some headwinds the business definitely needs to overcome but hey maybe it's just ridiculously cheap well I should say that I don't know this business intimately but on face value it certainly doesn't look at the stock is down since the end of 2021 when they completed the MailChimp acquisition but it does still sit around 415 dollars per share which gives it a PE ratio of about 60. so while it looked tasty for seven of our super investors I personally can't say I'm convinced straight off the bat so please if you guys have any more context on this business definitely let me know down in the comment section below but then moving on to the fourth most bought stock by our super investors in q1 we arrive at a bit of a controversial name and that is Meta Meta has obviously come under a lot of pressure across the past few years with their massive spending on metaverse development but also from the reduction in profitability of their advertising Apple has reduced the effectiveness of AD targeting on their devices the macroeconomic environment has caused many advertisers to pull back on their marketing budgets and then on top of that you also have the third big issue of short form video being notoriously difficult to monetize so just like that all of a sudden you've got quite a few tough headwinds for meta and these are headwinds that are still ongoing today it was this combination of factors that killed the stock about 70 between its high in 2021 and it's low in 2022 but what's been crazy is the stocks come back in 2023 since that low in November of 2022 metashares have gained approximately 180 percent so really impressive timing by our super investors on this one and it seems at least in recent times there does actually seem to be some positive news now coming out of the company that investors can cheer about in their most recent quarterly earnings they post their first year-over-year sales increase in four quarters revenue is up three percent year over year however to keep that in perspective costs did rise quite substantially as well so overall operating income is still 15 lower year over year leading to their operating margin falling from 31 to 25 year over year but their work limits of improvement and they did Issue optimistic guidance as well with second quarter Revenue expected to be between 29 and a half and 32 billion dollars now the interesting thing is if you just take that lower figure that would still represent two percent Revenue growth year over year so investors are going from extreme pessimism where Revenue isn't going anywhere to now a glimmer of optimism as they could see two consecutive quarters of year-over-year Revenue growth and as Peter Lynch says you don't necessarily need to be in a stock when it goes from good to great you can just find find those turnarounds that go from crappy to semi-crappy and usually the institutional money will swing the stock back around so a very interesting time for meta but usually this one is a feature in the most bought stocks buyer super investors so clearly the smart money are very confident in this business for the long run so overall that is meta and then coming in at number three we have Microsoft Microsoft was bought by nine of our super investors in q1 and there's no doubt they've continued to ride the wave of AI over the past few months in fact since chat gpt's release in November of 2022 Microsoft stock is now up about 40 percent now while it's true that open AI you know the people behind chat are not owned by Microsoft Microsoft is a significant shareholder in that business originally Microsoft signed a one billion dollar deal with open AI back in 2019 becoming open ai's exclusive technology partner and then earlier in this year they extended that partnership with a further 10 billion investment which prompted openai co-founder Elon Musk to practically admit the open AI are effectively controlled by Microsoft at this point and while the success of chat GPT hasn't meaningfully impacted Microsoft's Financial results the market is already jumping on board and pricing the future of AI into Microsoft stock and interestingly these developments have also prompted Bill Gates to get back into the stock holding it for his foundation it's now his biggest position in the portfolio and a little bit of extra anecdotal evidence when I was talking to Monash per Bri Mona should actually just sat down with a dinner with Bill Gates where Bill City thinks Microsoft actually has an Unstoppable lead in AI so a very interesting anecdote but of course nothing that we as value investors should necessarily be reading too much into what we should be more focused on of course is their core business because remember at its heart Microsoft has numerous software businesses which have gotten it to where it is today and with these core pieces of software usually you can find some pretty powerful switching modes from Windows to Office 365 to azure Xbox's Game Pass LinkedIn OneDrive Microsoft teams and so on it's these pieces of software that lock customers into giving Microsoft cash quarter after quarter and while AI is the hip new thing I'm sure that for the super investors it was likely the strength of their Core Business that made them want to buy in okay and with that said now we move on to the second most bought stock which was Amazon so Amazon was bought by 13 of our super investors and if I show you a picture of their stock chart I think you'll understand why over the last six months or so the stock has basically been reset 2020 levels due to their business suffering at the hands of the macro economic environment see over the last few years Amazon has really focused on expanding capacity to increase their revenue and their profitability but of course with this inflation we've seen right now their costs are rising equally as quickly their costs of goods sold are rising operating expenses are rising and ultimately for Amazon earnings are suffering however many value investors is the betting that while they're going through some short-term pain at the moment this period of investment will ultimately set them up for long-term gain as this is a trend we've seen for decades with Amazon money's probably among others is quick to use Amazon as an example of exceptional Capital allocation and you can see from this chart thanks to my buddies Brad and David that Amazon will not stop investing into growing their company as you can see while Alibaba and Google and meta and apple are generating cash and they're just sticking it on the pile 10 cent and Amazon are the only two on the list that are taking their money plus some and putting it back into growth Avenues within the business now businesses don't just do this willy-nilly so a table like this really shows you the companies that genuinely believe that they have something worth investing in so that's the story with Amazon and now finally we get to our most bought stock in q1 of 2023 and it is Google Now Google usually features around the number one two or three spot in this list each quarter and it's really not hard to see why despite advertisers pulling back on marketing budgets over the past year or so Google has been able to hold Revenue fairly steady and with their Cloud business still Gathering the momentum plus the amazing cushion that is their balance sheet I think the super investors are saying that this is just a money printing business that even during a recession doesn't even really go backwards they obviously have a very strong moat in internet search and that actually protects them better than a company like meta as no device manufacturer can really mess around with them you know devices are reliant on Google as opposed to a company like meta that is reliant on devices pretty much everyone uses Google and there isn't even a close second which puts Google in a very strong competitive position the moat is very powerful and it protects their cash flows even in a tough macro environment for example over the past four quarters their free cash flow has just consistently improved despite all that's been happening in terms of the economy and then on top of that you also have a company that has 115 billion in cash or short-term marketable securities and only 108 billion in total liabilities so that plus their moat plus their profitability plus the fact that the business traded around ninety dollars per share in q1 is most likely the combination of factors that had so many super investors buying the stock over the past few quarters but with that said guys they are the top five buys from the super investors in q1 of 2023 let me know what you think and let me know if any of these businesses actually feature in your portfolios I would love to hear any further opinions on these stocks down in the comment section below but guys that will just about do us for this video please leave a like if you enjoyed subscribe to the channel if you'd like to see more but with that said I'll see you guys in the next one

That could cause demand for AI software and hardware to more than triple the Wall Street estimate to a $15 trillion market by 2030  and create an $87 trillion enterprise value opportunity for stocks in the space, almost 35-times the current value.   I want to start our list off with the three AI ETFs, first because buying one of these will give you broad exposure across the theme, help you benefit from that runaway growth across artificial intelligence but also because it‚Äôs a great way to drill down and find other stocks to buy in the theme.   We‚Äôll look at three ETFs, all focused on robotics and that AI theme, how they‚Äôre set up and how to use them to find other AI stocks to watch.

estimates to a 15 trillion dollar market by 2030 and create an 87 trillion dollar Enterprise opportunity for stocks in the space almost 35 times the current value hey bowtie Nation Joseph Hulk here and I found five top AI stocks you need to be watching not only will I show you how to find these but a reason to invest you probably haven't thought about now I want to start our list with three AI funds first because buying into one of these is going to give you that broad exposure across the theme helping you benefit from that runaway growth across artificial intelligence but also because it's a great way to drill down and find other stocks to buy in that theme we'll look at three ETFs here all focused on that Robotics and AI theme how they're set up and how to use them to find find other AI stocks to watch the largest here is the globalx Robotics and AI ETF ticker botz a fund of 44 stocks up 25 so far this year I'll break down the Holdings of all three ETFs together for this but this is probably the most focused of the three funds next the robo Global Robotics and automation ETF ticker Robo a fund of 79 stocks is up 15 so far this year it's a little more geared towards that industrial use side of AI and is quite a bit more expensive than the other two funds at 0.95 expense ratio so I'll mostly just be using this one to mine the stock picks instead of investing directly in the fund then the ishares Robotics and AI ETF ticker irbo is the smallest fund at just 303 million dollars market cap but the broadest of the three holding 116 stocks this one is also up 15 since January but I thought I had some questionable choices like the fund managers kind of stretching trying to say that stocks like Netflix and Spotify should be in an AI fund again again each of these is going to give you that broad exposure but more importantly you can go to Holdings here on their website and download a full list of all the stocks in each fund it's the fastest way to find those individual stocks in a theme that you might want to research further I combined that list of stocks and found just nine stocks in all three ETFs with only seven of those traded in the US exchanges now several of these are more robotics focused than AI but it's a great way to start finding your companies to watch the global X botz and then that Robo ETF each have about half their stocks from foreign companies stocks us investors normally wouldn't get access to so that's a big plus for that broader exposure to the global AI theme you can also use the fund weight data on these the percentage of the fund invested in each stock to get that sense of the confidence the fund manager has in each stock so using this and then other research we can start to narrow down our list of four other stocks to give us that targeted exposure to specific companies and we can't talk AI without Microsoft ticker msft and early investor into open AI Mr Softy was one of the First Investors in open AI with a one billion dollar investment in 2019 that has now added another 12 billion into the company an evaluation of the startup at 29 billion dollars not only does Microsoft participate in that potential returns to the company's growth but it's also the exclusive provider of computing power for openai research products and interfaces for developers that's going to mean a boom in demand for Microsoft's Azure cloud services remember it was open ai's chat GPT that sparked that race in AI this year and now Microsoft is integrating the technology into Bing search sales marketing as well as Office 365 products with Wells Fargo analyst Michael Turin estimating it could add over 30 billion dollars in new revenue for Microsoft's cloud services alone now the problem for Microsoft and its investors here is that openai was set up as a capped profit entity after its startup as a non-profit now that means returns are restricted to 100x their money for early investors and even less for later investors like Microsoft any profits beyond that go back into the non-profit side of the business but that still does leave lots of room for upside for Microsoft not just in integrating those AI tools across its products but also that return on investment but Shares are already trading a little expensive here at 33 times on a price to earnings basis and and is a 2.3 trillion dollar company we're talking about here for Microsoft to even 10x your investment it would have to come close to the size of the entire U.S economy so I want to be looking for some smaller undiscovered plays in the AI theme as well and one of the most interesting opportunities on the list is anthropic founded by X openai employees and where the biggest worry today is that public use of AI and potentially negative outcomes anthropic is focused on safety in artificial intelligence now anthropic launched Claude a cloud gbt competitor in March with the expressed intent to avoid some of those harmful outputs and safety issues that we've seen with open ai's chat GPT and the language model uses a constitutional AI framework to guide the output in kind of a subjectively safer and more helpful Direction in essence Claude has been called the AI with a moral compass in effect it's built a system that is less likely to produce that harmful output it's easier to hold a conversation with and easier to use with less effort so while chat gbt may still be better for tasks such as programmer coding and generation anthropic's Claude could become a more human-centered chat system anthropic was founded by openai's former vice president of research Dario emodi and Tom Brown its lead engineer for AI language model gpt3 it's since added technical staff and expects to launch a frontier model of the Claude chat tool that will be 10 times more powerful than existing AI models the company has an impressive list of backers including a 300 million dollar invest assessment from Google that gives it 10 percent of anthropic as well as a 1.3 billion from Salesforce Ventures a Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskowitz and other investors the latest funding round in March valued the company at 4.1 billion dollars now anthropic is still a private company but if you're an accredited investor right now I'm the disrupter platform you can invest in the company for as little as five thousand dollars this Raptor offers investments in the most advanced private companies right on the platform you can get detailed information about the company the structure of the deal fees and investment risks and apply to invest I'll leave a link in the description below for that anthropic deal on the disrupter platform so check that out another publicly traded AI stock here though much more focused on that theme than Microsoft is palantir Technologies ticker pltr palantir is leaning heavy into artificial intelligence with this AIP platform for business and a standalone platform for defense the software platform builds analytics and AI solutions to use immense data libraries and help in a real-time decision making in fact the new aipb platform includes a chat GPT like language model and other applications here integrated into the company's existing machine learning technology CEO Alex carp noted in the q1 earnings that demand for AI tools has been unprecedented helping the company to grow Revenue by 20 plus percent in the US and become profitable for the first quarter ever and what I really like about palantir besides that double-digit growth management is focused on becoming more profitable at the same time increasing the operating margin to 24 percent in the quarter a full year revenue for the company is expected to come in 16 higher at 2.2 billion which means after that 59 run in the shares this year it's trading at 46 times expected earnings of 22 cents a share even more expensive than Microsoft now I do think palantir has the more focused growth in AI but the stock price is baking in a lot of that growth and we've still got that last AI stock you need to be watching and we've already covered that immense opportunity and growth and potential return even if this estimate by Arc invest is off by a wide margin instead of growing to 87 trillion let's say the equity value of AI companies just Grows by to 50 trillion dollars by 2030. that would still be a 20-fold increase or a 30 plus annualized return but investing in AI stocks goes way beyond that return because it's also income protection folks if you work in well just about anything there is a chance your job goes bye-bye because of AI artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize work touching nearly every job and increasing productivity by by estimates of a hundred and forty percent just in the next seven years now this goes well beyond the job shown here what about those truck drivers or taxi drivers replaced by self-driving what about the warehouse workers replaced through robotics Nation corporations say productivity increases but we all know what that means it means getting more done in less time or fewer people now I'm not preaching the end to all jobs like you hear about but the only way to fully protect your income from this kind of shift is is by investing in the companies that will make it happen but maybe I'm just being paranoid what do you think let me know in the comments how far you think AI is going to go from a little more than a meme generator to the robot apocalypse shares of Nvidia ticker nvda jumped 14 on its most recent earnings after the CEO called the potential in AI a transformative iPhone moment Nvidia pioneered The Accelerated Computing critical to the shift to AI a combination of super fast chips algorithms and refactoring to speed up the traditional compute intensive parts of an application and no other company has benefited from the recent interest with shares up 109 just this year the company recently announced a partnership with Deutsche Bank to accelerate Ai and machine learning in the financial services sector following nvidia's expanded partnership with Mercedes-Benz to develop AI systems in Auto now as you know though that AI Focus comes at a cost full year sales are expected 12 higher to 30 billion dollars for earnings of 4.58 cents a share now that puts Nvidia at an even pricier evaluation of 65 times on that priced earnings basis

locker which believe it or not is a dividend Investor's dream come true right now there are dozens of deals to be found on the market and tons of stocks that are sinking in share price but in this video there are five in particular we'll be focusing on that look like exceptionally good buys as we head into the month of June but before we get to those in case you're new to the channel my name is Ryan Williams and here we strictly talk about dividend stocks and how you can invest in them to create passive income and reach Financial Freedom so if you love dividend stocks and if you're on a mission to retire early then hit that subscribe button I'd love to stay in touch as we both continue to grow our portfolios and collect that cash flow and now moving on the first stock on our list today is William Sonoma WSM who just reported some pretty mixed earnings where they missed on the top line but beat on the bottom line and still reaffirmed their guidance for the year which briefly saw the share price pop up but this brief jump was very short-lived and later that day the share price ended up coming back down and overall across the month William Sonoma is down 4.73 so quite a big drop in the last 30 days and then here today they are down about half a percent and it's come off quite a bit from their February share price highs of about 143 dollars per share all the way down to where it's at now about 113 and a half dollars per share and with that they are inching closer and closer to their 52-week low but right now the current valuation is looking great first looking at their p e ratio here this is sitting nice and low in the single digits 8.39 which is 35.4 percent below the five year average so that's looking really good and then scrolling down their price to book is 4.06 so not the lowest but this is 20 lower than the five year average and the price to cash flow is looking really good 6.78 which is 30 percent lower than the five-year average and Switching gears and talking about the dividend their starting yield so if you were to buy into William Sonoma today you'd be getting a 3.15 yield which is pretty nice and this is also nearly 30 percent above the company's five-year average dividend yield and the rest of the dividend stats are looking great as well the payout ratio is really low sitting there just below 15 and the five-year growth rate is actually just above 15 and it's pretty rare to see The Five-Year growth rate on the dividend higher than the payout ratio we really don't see that too often but I'll tell you what I'll take it and to top it all off William Sonoma has 16 straight years of dividend growth so their dividend stats overall are looking really good and this is a company that I'm actually planning on adding to my portfolio I've had William Sonoma sitting on my buy list for a while now and I was kind of waiting to see what came out of their quarterly earnings report before I decided to pull the trigger but to me they seem pretty well positioned for a rougher economic environment if things do continue to Trend that way but we'll see guys you may see me start a position here in Williams-Sonoma in the coming weeks I'll definitely keep you posted but anyway moving on the next stock is UPS United Parcel Service who's been at a steady decline all month long but really fell off a cliff at the end of April after they revealed a Miss on both the top and bottom line for their quarterly earnings looking at their share price performance UPS is down nearly five percent just in the last month so a pretty big drop there and then year to date they are down just about three percent and like William Sonoma UPS is also inching closer and closer to their 52-week low and I will say the valuation is looking decent overall once again starting here with the p e ratio it's 15.6 so quite a bit higher than what we saw with William Sonoma but in its own we're at a 15-ish p e ratio it's really not too bad and still this is about five and a half percent lower than the company's five-year average p e ratio and then scrolling down looking at the forward Price to Book this is 6.62 so decently high but at the same time this is nearly 60 percent lower than the company's five-year average price to book and then last but not least looking at the price of cash flow 11.39 which is really not too bad I mean we'd prefer to see that in the single digits but it's still it's not terrible and interestingly enough this is a bit higher than the five-year average by nearly four percent so that's definitely something to keep in mind but anyway Switching gears and looking at the dividend right now the yield is actually decently high sitting at 3.86 which is about 25.6 percent above the company's five-year average yield so a nicer cash flow return today and the rest of the dividend stats are looking great as well the power ratio is sitting right there in The Sweet Spot about 50 percent with a five-year growth rate that's really nice 12 and a half percent we'd love to see those double digit five year growth rates especially when paired with a yield that's nearing four percent really like to see that they have a pretty nice dividend growth history as well 13 straight years but diving a bit deeper into this they've actually been making consecutive payments for the last 22 straight years so a little bit longer history there and it looks to me if we look at the dividend history chart the only year where they really didn't grow the dividend was right here between 2008 2009 but otherwise that dividend growth history has been very consistent but anyway guys moving on to the third stock of the day we're talking about Archer Daniels Midland ADM and this is the first time I've ever talked about this company on the channel I think but anyway in contrast to UPS ADM actually reported some pretty solid numbers for their most recent quarter with Revenue in line with expectations and a Beat on earnings per share yet they are still down about six and a half percent in the last month so a bigger drop than the first two companies we've seen and then year to date they are down a whopping 19 cheese and as I'm sure you can imagine this puts them extremely close to their 52-week lows we can see on the right hand side of the screen there and the valuation overall is looking pretty attractive looking at the PE Ratio there 10 and a half really nice p e ratio love to see that and this is also 22 and a half percent below the five year average and scrolling down looking at their price to book it's sitting at 1.64 which in its own right is a nice price to book with that said it is 7.6 above the five year average we won't read too much into that I really like the price to book where it's at and the price to cash flow is looking great as well 9.2 sitting nice and low there in the single digits now regarding the dividend out of the three companies we've talked about so far I will say these are the least exciting at least in terms of yield and dividend growth rate as you can see in both departments it really doesn't jump off the screen at you I mean the yield is only two and a half percent the five year growth rate is only 5.3 percent but what they lack in yield and growth rate they certainly make up for inconsistency and reliability because according to Seeking Alpha they've been growing this dividend for the last almost 30 years but I actually don't think this is quite accurate I do believe and correct me if I'm wrong in the comments I do believe Archer Daniel's mid lid is a dividend King but anyway moving on to the fourth stock of the day this one is Abby who started tanking last month after their quarterly earnings and has been in a steady downward slump since then just in the last month they are down nearly 16 percent you see it really kicked off right here at the end of April and then here today they are down about 14 and a half percent almost there and then the last 365 days they are down nearly seven percent and they're getting pretty dang close to that 52-week low they're well within I'd say about five percent or so of reaching it and I'll tell you what as an appv shareholder I'm particularly excited about this one because the dividend yield is officially back up over four percent bringing double treble to the dividend Department not only do they have a super high yield 4.2 percent but that five-year growth rate is really high as well 14 and a half percent and they have a decently respectable dividend growth history nine straight years so they've been growing this dividend pretty much ever since they spun off from Abbott Laboratories now I would love to add some more to my Abbey position but with an average cost per share of 114.20 I think it still needs to come down more before I begin buying again and right now I'm still sitting above a 20 percent share price gain so that's pretty substantial and on a total return basis I'm up over 30 but anyway moving on to the fifth and final stock of the day this one is Domino's Pizza which you really don't hear me talking about too often but Domino's basically dropped 10 just in a day after reporting would seem like pretty solid numbers for their quarterly earnings but anyway in the last month they are down 7.35 you can see that right here they really really dropped in share price and then year to date they are down 10.3 percent which has them getting pretty close to their 52-week low there now looking at the valuation at first glance this may not seem that great with a p e ratio of 23.1 But Domino's is a company that is seeing a lot of growth and so typically with that you'll see a higher p e ratio so it may be justified and still their five-year average p e ratio is even higher than it is today I mean the five-year average is 30.6 so right now it's 24 and a half percent below that and now Switching gears looking at the dividend yield you guys I know at 1.6 dividend yield is not going to knock your socks off but still this is 64 percent above the five-year average dividend yield that's pretty crazy to see and the rest of the dividend stats are looking great as well really low pair ratio below 35 percent there with a sweet sweet five-year growth rate 18 and a half percent that's the highest we've seen today and their dividend growth history is not bad nine consecutive years and with that guys those were the five stocks that I really wanted to hone in on but still there are so many great stocks out there that look like pretty sweet deals as we head into the following month that I think you need to keep your eye on the first one is Starbucks who has dropped 10 percent just in the last 30 days which puts them officially under 100 per share which is nice to see and then looking at their year-to-date performance they are down 2.4 percent and moving on the next one is Target who is down over 14 just in the last 30 days so really big drop there and I know at least a certain portion of the share price decline has come from some boycott surrounding the company you guys may have your thoughts on that and that's totally fine but more than anything I'm just trying to show you a potential opportunity to buy a nice dividend King at a somewhat of a discount but anyway year to date that puts Target at a near eight percent loss so once again guys it could be a potential opportunity and then next up we've got realty income who is down 5.2 percent in the last month sitting officially under 60 per share which is where I know a lot of you guys like to start buying and then year-to-date they are down 7.8 so a pretty big drop so far in 2023. anyway next up another Real Estate Investment Trust WP Carey who is down 7.6 just in the last 30 days which puts them at a year-to-date loss of 13.4 percent and I might have to start swooping up some more shares of WP carry that's looking pretty good anyway next up is Johnson and Johnson a legendary dividend King who is down six percent just in the last month which puts them at a year-to-date loss in the double digits about 13 anyway next up another dividend King this one has just been beaten down to Smithereens guys we are talking about 3M who is down another nine percent just in the last month and then year to date they are down over 21 anyway next up is UGI Corporation who is down 19 and a half percent just in the last 30 days which puts them at a year-to-date loss getting pretty dang close to 30 percent and they are right there at their 52-week low and the next up guys we've got Tyson Foods who has dropped another near 15 just in the last 30 days which puts them at a year-to-date loss just about 19 and then the second to last one is Qualcomm Who's down nearly 13 in the last 30 days which puts them at a year to date loss only five percent not too bad but you can see that they're really trending down in share price really steady downward slump and then last but not least guys we've got Walgreens boots Alliance who is down 15 just in the last 30 days which puts them at a year-to-date loss of about 19 so really big drop all across the board and taking a quick look at their dividend stats actually look how high that yield is getting guys six percent actually six and a quarter percent that's unbelievable and with that if you want to learn about another super high yielding dividend stock then check out this next video right over here where I'm telling you about one that is yielding 10 and it is firing on all cylinders and looks like a great pickup right now I just added some more shares of this stock to my own portfolio which I'm telling you all about in this video so click right over here to check it out and I'll see in the next one

have just been crushing it so far and that's great but nobody cares about the past Luke we want to talk about right now so let's get into those stocks today I just ask in exchange for you to gently tap that like button and consider subscribing to it's super easy to do if you like the truth without the hype now remember these are just the stocks that I'm specifically targeting right now there's actually 15 stocks on my watch list that I'm looking at but some of them have had great runs some of them are still significantly overvalued and need to come back down kind of like those old man stocks and some of those dividend plays and some of those stocks like that so I'm not looking to buy those you let buy those yet if I could talk ooh it's a struggle today I think these to me are on the biggest discounts based upon my valuation and my plan and stocks come on this list come off this list go back on this list you know the things change things move so you've got to keep your watch list updated but these right now are the ones right now today that are on their best you know the best value per se out there not value in terms of value stock the best value in regards to my valuation and my plan remember I got blasted for having Google meta Amazon all those stocks on my list when they when these low 90s basically when they got under 100 I got blasted because why would you want those they're trash they're going down whatever the case was just simple answer is they were the best value at the time and then after they kind of started their run it was hey we were looking at Tesla we're looking at palantir look at those stocks at around 100 and you know down in the sixes and sevens for palantir those right there were the Best Buys in the stock market and now we got our latest little crop right here because some of our plays have run up to where hey they're no longer they're still great values but they're no longer the best value that I see out there and the huge mega Memorial Day sale is live where you can see my buy and sell alerts in real time you can see my watch list with price targets you can take five courses for free hang out with the best six and seven figure Discord members ever and have access to me anytime you want slide into my DMs get on live q and A's so much information down there you know it's unbelievable actually we have a stock analyzing tool it's going to be free for a member to use as well just so much down there make sure you check out the pin comment and see if it's right for you and you know take advantage of that Memorial Day sale before it ends all right so right now for me these are the best deals on the market as of right now now I'm not saying they're as good as when meta was in the 80s I'm not saying they're screaming deals like that I don't know if we'll see deals like that that was kind of a once in a decade type uh deal on a stock there but these to me are the best deals in regards to you know my portfolio my plan and my valuations on these stocks so stock number one would be Sofi and honestly guys I know it's been on my list for a while it's one of those stocks that just kind of it they give great guidance have very good earnings calls are continuing to grow continuing to get uh closer and closer and closer to profitability they cannot execute any better however I can't say that they're not also stuck and kind of that whole you know the the banking crisis type thing that's going on right now I say crisis with air quotes because it's not nearly as disaster as everybody's made it out to be however I can say hey Sofi is you know fintech they're not profitable right now and they would definitely fall onto kind of that small Bank type category so I cannot say that it should just totally break out and be totally not lumped in with everybody else because I understand why they're being lumped in with somebody else and Wall Street isn't going to do the type digging that we do to figure out the winners from the losers in that whole thing they're just going to lump everybody into losers honestly at this stage I mean you got the CEO gobbling up shares just everything performing underneath right they're just out of favor right now in a sector that's out of favor and this happens in the stock market I know they're beat down and honestly on the flip side of all this that's what you want as a long-term Buy and Hold investor an extended period of time where stocks that you think are great are beaten down and you get a discount and you can build out a much larger position at a much cheaper cost per share than you should have been able to if it would have just gradually gone up after each earnings call and continue to improve now obviously it will have its run one day but for right now it continues to stay beaten down and as long as they continue to execute I you know I can find very few places to where putting my money there is a safer bet than I think it is with Sofi right now so next up is kind of a controversial one I think it's a lot of controversial one every time I just say the word it just you know a lot a lot of negative come comments come into the comments section here but I'm gonna say it anyways and it's PayPal guys and I know I know it's it's one of those things that they haven't had incredible earnings but they've had good earnings good guidance and it just can't get out of its own way I mean it's in fed Tech which the sector is completely beaten down you got square or block or whatever the heck it's called now having issues so that's bled over into PayPal too even though they say they're not having those issues there's just a lot of things working against PayPal right now in regards to this stock price but the company underneath has been performing just fine if you're paying attention to their earnings calls and actually going through the data now I agree it's not mind-blowing I'm not saying that at all it's not beaten down as bad as Meadow was I'm also not trying to say that either but what I'm saying is there are very few places I can find to where in terms of valuation their stocks that are cheaper in regards to valuation where PayPal is right now I agree the run up after all the illness off and the shutdown and everything whatever the case was that stock price was ridiculous I don't have that as my Target price or anything else like that but but I also don't need it to get halfway there in order for this to be an incredible gainer in my portfolio and I absolutely think it is trading significantly undervalued now I hear all you guys in advance who are going to scream at me saying Luke it's been down for over a year now it's gone nowhere why would you continue to put money it's clearly a loser because it hadn't gone anywhere for a year year and a half or so I guess we're not quite to a year and a half here but we're well past a year now in regards to not going anywhere why would you keep putting money into that does that isn't that stock a loser and my response to you is during the greatest bull market of all time this past bull market we just had the greatest bull market of all time Tesla traded flat for six years Apple perhaps the greatest company during this bull run traded flat for six months at a time sometimes a year a little bit more than a year I can say the same for Microsoft for Google for Amazon all those companies during the greatest bull run of all time had periods where they traded flat or down for six months or a year or more but your trying to tell me during a bear Market when we had the highest inflation in history the FED raised rates the highest in history and coming off a ridiculous high that was way too high it's unrealistic for a stock to trade down or flat for a period of a year year and a half or so during that kind of a time frame much less during the greatest bull market of all time if that can happen to Apple during the greatest bull market of all time it's not unreasonable or it's out of the ordinary or signals anything different or wrong with PayPal in regards to it trading down during you know basically a bear market during some very unique times in the history of the markets so I agree not everybody likes the stock understand that's okay there's the beauty of stock market is there's tons of stocks you can buy there's tons of winners you can buy and we don't need all the same winners there's not going to be five winners or 10 winners or 20 winners there's going to be hundreds of winners maybe even thousands of winners over the long run so we don't all need the right stocks but for me this is the right stock for me and my portfolio all right and on to the final stock here and that would be Airbnb BMB and again I know not everybody likes it I just love the stock I think they're doing great things they continue to get better quarter after quarter after quarter they're coming into their good season here and they were on a nice little run but now they pulled back pretty significantly and that to me if it continues to pull back it's gonna really get into that undervalued territory really undervalued so I've really got my eyes on Airbnb especially if it gets underneath 100 you'll definitely see some big buys from me back into this stock here not that I sold it it kind of sounded like I traded I haven't traded it but I haven't been buying it recently because it's had such a nice run up in the stock price so if it gets back down around that range I absolutely will be buying again and if you don't know how to do evaluation and have a plan for a stock make sure you check out the market Insider's private group or we teach you exactly that through five courses you get

READ THE FULL DISCLAIMER HERE: https://everythingmoney.com/disclaimer",930.0,29099,436,all right guys 3M stock I'm going to tell you something I've started a position in 3M stock NOW first off do not buy 3M stock just because I did you need to do your own homework I've never bought a company just because they've a big investor has ever look at Warren Buffett he's buying Apple I am not touching Apple until much lower prices if I can do that to Warren Buffett you can certainly do it with me I will show you why I bought 3M but again you should not buy it just because I have mode you started positioning I know he did not so look at us mode not start a position I did and the great news is I want people in our community fight me on this reach out to me and tell me why I shouldn't have bought 3M tell me Paul you're wrong and here's why and there are concerns I have about 3M but we'll go through it and we'll understand it but again you're never to buy or sell anything just because I've bought or sold it ever ever ever ever ever you have to think for yourself and we're here to teach you how to fish not to give you fish so let's check out 3M in our software and it's funny because in our community everybody always say Paul we know you have to you know you have to be careful and stuff I'm like listen we take regulation very seriously so whenever we tell you that we bought something you're not to buy it just because we've done that if you do that is a bad decision but do your own research learn how to fish yourself so 3M stock is down quite a bit from its all-time high of 260 in January of 2018 Mo wow this is 3M Mo yeah I mean this it probably everybody that's watching this somewhere in your room you probably have a 3M product 100 you make the weirdest stuff we have two of them right there look at the Post-its right there it says bull versus bear and Pitch those are three those are three M two everything is there's so much 3M everywhere yeah and they're so a couple here's the first thing I don't like about 3M five billion dollar market cap and look at this Enterprise Value the difference here is the debt it's a big difference however however I will say this Mo there are long-term debt to free cash flow is only 3.8 oh so they're long-term debt of this debt is only like 16 billion dollars and you go to the balance sheet we can scroll all the way to the bottom and see total long-term liabilities uh 21 billion okay so it's 3.8 times there you go okay so it's still a lot of debt but it's a big company with very consistent look at this look at this Mo five year profit margin of 16.4 one year of 16.3 do they consistently make money yep six point one percent dividends what I was looking at right now it eats up a big chunk of their free cash flow but guys how is 3M going to grow yeah like can you make another Post-It note please maybe Wild colors well I'm sure they already have that they beat me to it look at this Enterprise Value to earnings 15 times I mean that's incredible return on Equity 37 return a message Capital 14. so guys the great thing about this is when 3M does find an area they can invest a lot in they do it yeah and they don't and they get a high return of their money but in the meantime if they don't have that guess what they're doing they're paying out in dividends that's what we want to see so they're paying I'm okay with dividends if they have no other use of the money because I don't want them wasting their money wasting my money as a shareholder on making bad Acquisitions and other Investments buying back shares too they're buying back shares ten years ago they had 675 million average diluted shares outstanding now it's 553 yeah they're buying back stock at 11 times the trailing 12-month earnings right now they're at 10pe buy the crap and as the shares go down in price keep buying back more shares I'll buy I could I want to buy some more too I'm gonna buy more shares now guys my guess is this stock will be a lot cheaper at some point in the future why because I think the Market's just really overpriced if you're in our community here if you subscribe to our channel for only a dollar a day you get the software and every day I put my stock market to GDP ratio in there and we're still according to history going back to 1929 70 overvalued so my guess is that a company like this will probably go down will it hopefully go down less because the PE is already low of 10 and the dividend yield is high yeah I hope so but dividend yield being a six percent is that stable well look at this free cash flow last year it dropped from their five-year average from five and a half billion down to four and their dividends eat up 3.3 billion of that so how do you buy back shares and pay that dividend and do all those things right that's very difficult to do so maybe the dividend will stick around maybe they'll cut it even they cut it in half I'm happy with a three percent dividend yield as long as they're buying back hell guys if the if the stock fell in half today I would tell them cut your dividend and just buy back tons of shares because this is not taxable and what's the the stock buyback rate one percent yeah that's stupid thing yeah all right let's look at their cash flow in the last five years and see why there was a big change in the last year I mean look at this consistent cash flow guys I know four point three five five five four five seven five six seven five four very consistent the last decade has been consistent with the exception of a covered bump I mean guys this is like to me this is why I'm liking this let's go to our eight pillars two x's usually the two x's are these two PE and price of free cash flow free cash flows down fine and net income is down fine it's a very consistent company and the revenue growth is not going to be big not going to be big at all let's look at the revenue growth I mean they've been stuck at 30 billion for the last 10 years might even start shrinking maybe so so let's do our stock analyzer tool Mo yeah if I told you 3M was gone in 20 years would you be surprised yes yeah I'd be absolutely shocked yes I'm gonna do a 20-year analysis Mo do you mind doing a 10-year analysis actually why you do a five year analysis let's do it a little bit different all right so we're gonna do a five and ten and twenty year analysis and the reason being is I want to buy companies I want to own for a long period of time and if if 3M Falls 50 but my thesis is still the same I want to buy back more shares to make even more money in 20 years if you can't do that you should not be buying individual stocks you absolutely should just stick to ETFs but if you want to get in the individual stock game the stock analyzer tool has changed the game for people in our community 1.3 million times it was used last year it doesn't include the balance sheet but it gives you a value of the business based on the future projections of your earnings and free cash flow let me show how it goes first line Revenue growth guys look at this Revenue growth it's absolute crap so let's be a little let's be a little conservative let's call it negative one percent over the next 20 years let's call it 2.5 and let's call it actually let's go to and then five percent Revenue growth so I did a low middle and high I did negative one percent two and then five percent profit margin it's the same I'm just going to keep it the same all across the board so I just shook my head I was like how do I change this free cash flow I'm actually gonna do the exact same thing again it's very consistent it's a consistent business now think about it now for PE though this doesn't mean I'm doing very I'm doing this different than I did the last 3M video I'm assuming negative growth I need to make my money through an earnings multiple so I'm gonna go eight I'm gonna go ten 14 and 18 p e and price of free cash flow because I think their brand name if they're able to get back to decent Revenue growth should sell for a premium to the market because it's a high moat business look at this 10-year roic 16 and a half percent this is a sign of a moat that they can get they can get and maintain a high return on invested capital all right that's the big key now for my desired return guys I've made some really low assumptions here so I don't need as big a return and I've made some pretty high assumptions here so I need a bigger return and the bigger return you want is the higher margin of safety right Mo so mo why don't you tell me what you want to do with these desire returns I put in 10 11 and 12 but my spread was very different from yours so if I was you I'd go a little bit higher I'm doing 10 11 and a half and 13 okay all right because on the low side even though the market can do 10 I'm buying up but I think because it'll be a top quality business better than the market better than the overall average in the market and I'm okay making 10 on that one yeah so I'm at the analyze button Mo hit it too yep low price 89 high price 140 middle price 109. it's clearly my watch list at 95 bucks because I want to notify me again so I can start selling more puts on the company what'd you get mine's 81 to 116 Middle Ground about a hundred okay so you're basically there too and and I I didn't have a lot of fluctuation in my numbers so I don't really see them declining in three percent Revenue over the next five years like I think negative one I can see all of these situations being reasonable yeah and I look at this thing a lot yeah I look at this saying guys at some point this company's got to get into paying down debt and buying back even more shares especially as the stock goes lower so guys again don't buy this company just because I did that's good it's going to end up costing you in the long run but sit there and learn a process when you learn the process you will become more free you'll feel better about yourself check out everythingmoney.com is a way to start one dollar per day for seven days check it out it'll change the way in which you look at money

UCdLzNzag8APY4tx6GHYN2Lg,2023-06-01T20:30:00Z,,3vUX1_m8iUM,Buy Hold Sell: 5 boring stocks trading at beautiful prices,"There's this idea in dating that you shouldn't pursue beautiful people. Why? Well, thanks to their good looks, they haven't had to struggle their entire lives to be as outgoing, funny, and desirable as us mere mortals. And so, they will likely lack a certain je ne sais quoi...  While I am not sure the proposition is entirely true, there is something about being both boring and beautiful - particularly when it comes to investing.   Oftentimes, we are distracted by the next sparkly new trend, losing the patience and discipline needed to stick to our strategies and generate long-term returns.   When it comes down to it, investing isn't meant to be thrilling. It's not meant to get your heart racing. The likelihood of getting rich quick is zero to none. In fact, investing in ""boring"" stocks over the long term is how Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway became the US$702.6 billion giant it is today.   So in this episode, Livewire's Ally Selby was joined by PM Capital's Paul Moore and Antipodes' Jacob Mitchell for their analysis of three ""boring but beautifully priced stocks.""   And just because I know you love a stock pick, they also name a boring stock they believe can withstand the cycle and come out stronger on the other side too.   Note: This episode was filmed on Wednesday, May 31 2023. You can read an edited transcript below.  https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/buy-hold-sell-5-boring-stocks-trading-at-beautiful-prices  Timecodes:  0:00 - Intro  2:20 - Is Barrick Gold Corporation (TSE: ABX) a buy, hold or sell?  3:31 - Is Shell (LON: SHEL) a buy, hold or sell?  4:57 - Is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) a buy, hold or sell?  6:42 - Paul Moore's pick: Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) 7:20 - Jacob Mitchell's pick: Sanofi (EPA: SAN)",70.0,3041,6,foreign hey how you doing and welcome to livewire's by hold cell I'm Ali Selby and today we're searching the globe for stocks that can withstand the cycle and come out stronger on the other side these stocks might be boring but sometimes boring is beautiful at least that's what my boyfriend tells me so today we're joined by PM capitals Paul Moore and Antiquities Jacob Mitchell thank you so much for joining me today gents Paul I might start on you where are we in the cycle I'm sure you're not boring but um who knows um you know you can use the academic you know textbooks but to be honest I'd throw them out the window yeah everything's kind of been shortened these days and so some parts of the market are way ahead some of them are behind basically I think we're in an environment which is stuck in the middle in terms of the market kind of oscillating around you know you've got higher interest rates you've got concerns on the economy you've got reasonable valuations but some is cheap some are expensive so yeah I just think we're in a 10-year cycle where it's going to be hard to make money from some sort of passive type investing you're gonna have to really pick your spots and make sure you're concentrated where you genuinely believe you're going to get a risk reward proposition that is acceptable to whatever your risk reward characteristics are over to you Jacob where do you think we are in the cycle definitely late cycle I mean you can't put as much tightening into the system as has gone in without eventually breaking something which is starting you know starting to happen so definitely a late cycle but within the context of maybe having shifted fundamentally to a different regime where we actually are going to have Cycles we had 10 years of you know not much other than QE and a fairly you know average outcome I think now just a lot more fiscal activism and central banks are actually amplifying that rather than acting in a counter-cyclical manner so I think we're going back to an environment of relatively large cycles and fairly frequent ones and I think we're just coming to the end of you know the covert let's call it boom yeah okay let's get into the stocks now first up we have gold and copper Miner Barrack Gold Corporation that's a market cap of more than 40 billion Canadian dollars Jacob we're going to start with you is it a buy hold or sell look I think it's a constructive hold the gold prices are arguably undervalued relative to the environment where you have a lot of central banks monetizing government debt and we think that's that's a that's attractive for gold as an alternative currency and then the company is doing I think a better job in terms of Capital Management and it's cheap if you think about how gold stocks are priced they're very cheap relative to their let's call it production okay its share price is down Paul is it a buy hold or sell today it's a sell I'd rather buy copper stocks yeah today uh gold valuations a bit ahead of itself whereas the copper stocks have come back with a copper price but medium to longer term I want to own gold for the inflationary reasons and what we're looking to do is have two or three copper gold stocks in our portfolio remembering that gold stocks produce copper and copper stocks produce gold okay next up today we have shell it's an oil and gas giant Paul is it a buy hold or sell definite hold done well short term but on very conservative oil and gas prices it's still on a probably a 10p at most and it's paying importantly a hundred percent of its free cash flow out in sort of dividends and BuyBacks paying down debts so you know we want to own a longer term so definite hold it has been volatile in the Commodities where it works crude Futures are down 37 over the past year natural gas is down 73 percent Jacob is it a buy hold or sell uh hold again um yeah look I think the structural story is a good one like the energy stocks are generally under investing they have for some time and uh and also in the case of shell and a stock we owned total energies you're getting a free option in the on natural gas and and that's that's important we think that in Europe you had a very you know fortunately for the Europeans they had a very warm winter so natural gas prices have sort of collapsed but I think you know you can see tightness coming back into that market and it gives you some protection from a real shortage once again given we've taken a lot of the you know the Russian Supply effectively off the market okay next up today we have alphabet it's definitely a stock that's become quite crowded this year over to you Jacob is it a buy hold or sell I think it's a cell I think alphabet is sort of approaching that you know growth trap sort of description it's it's business at a great you know Great Mouse Trap hard to replicate but it's also very mature now and you can see sort of threats coming on the horizon we Ai and those sorts of searches you know chat GPT is already running at about nine percent of all internet searches so we think you know ultimately it's taking away eyeballs from what you would do using Google search even though Google has barred now well Bard isn't monetized so until they work out a way that they can throw in four or five ads into the bad result then you know then the jury's out right so we would say the margin of error is starting to expand and and it's also you know digital advertising very economically sensitive we think you're going You're Still expectations are too high um and uh yeah look we think there's better uses for uh capital okay it's done really well since the beginning of the year its share price is up 40 percent Paul over to you is it a buy hold or sell yeah so it was a great buy six to nine months ago yeah but I still think it's a Hulk uh it has matured but it's a monopoly um and I think they hang around longer than people think and if you remember the old classified businesses how long are you know they hung around and the multiples they sold on and relative to the other top 10 sort of growth stocks it's actually quite reasonable so I think a few others will be sold before yeah they sell alphabets so for me a definite hold okay we asked Our Guest to bring along one boring but beautiful stock for us today Paul what have you brought for us uh Bank America now it's probably not boring right at the moment because there's a few little banking issues going on but I think they're short-term in nature and ultimately it's a pretty simple business deposit franchise lens money pretty dull and boring business with a very low valuation and that's the beauty of it you know when you're selling at eight to ten times earnings once we get through these disruptions people focus on the dividends the BuyBacks and so yeah we think it's you know very boring but interesting okay over to you Jacob what stock do you think can we stand the cycle and come out strong running our other side something that's boring but trading at a beautiful price yeah I don't think you can get more boring than Pharmaceuticals uh Santa Fe is a is a French pharmaceutical company it doesn't have much exposure to drug price risk like it's not selling Pharmaceuticals into the us at inflated prices it also has a really interesting um let's call it consumer health business so drugs that go off patent so no patent risk and that's like a it should be now that that business should train on quite a high multiple it's like a consumer staple business and then finally it has like a has the vaccines business so it's it's three interesting businesses on a p of 12. very little economic sensitivity and uh like I think that's that sort of fits the bill if you want boring but beautiful valuation okay well I hope you enjoyed the episode of buy hold cell as much as I did if you did why not give it a like remember to subscribe to our YouTube channel we're adding so much great content every single week [Applause]

Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy For 2023 Best AI Stocks To Buy. There's more than one way to position your portfolio to benefit from a continuing AI revolution. ... Alphabet (GOOGL) ... Google parent Alphabet recently launched a test version of its own AI chatbot called Bard, which functions like ChatGPT. Ask it a question and Bard quickly accesses, compiles and summarizes online information to provide an answer. Some see this as the next evolution of search. Rather than querying a search engine to receive a selection of webpages to view, you get one answer that's both simple and complete. Unfortunately for Alphabet, Bard botched its test launch. In a short demo video intended to showcase Bard‚Äôs power, the chatbot gave an incorrect answer. Clearly, Alphabet has some work to do on its technology. Outside of Bard, Alphabet offers business AI tools and infrastructure through its Google cloud computing unit.  Microsoft (MSFT) Microsoft has been investing in OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT, since 2019. The partnership began with a $1 billion investment and the agreement that Microsoft exclusively would provide cloud computing services to the AI lab. In January 2023, Microsoft announced it would extend the OpenAI partnership into a ‚Äúmultiyear, multibillion-dollar investment.‚Äù Microsoft also has a stated goal to make AI technology universally accessible through its Azure cloud computing platform. And, like Alphabet, Microsoft recently debuted an AI chatbot for its search engine Bing. Unfortunately, Bing‚Äôs chatbot also failed the accuracy test. As reported by Dmitri Brereton, the chatbot misstated financial information pulled from Gap and Lululemon quarterly reports.  Bearish Price Predictions for C3.AI What is the future of C3 AI stock? Average Price Target Based on 11 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for C3ai in the last 3 months. The average price target is $20.50 with a high forecast of $30.00 and a low forecast of $12.00. The average price target represents a -15.29% change from the last price of $24.20.  Is C3 AI profitable? Siebel said the company is on track to be profitable on a non-GAAP, or adjusted, basis by the end of fiscal 2024. He said the company expected faster growth in fiscal 2024, but declined to provide a more specific forecast. The C3.ai chief said artificial intelligence changes the nature of enterprise search engines.May 15, 2023  DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor. These videos are for educational purposes only.

last three we've gotten some spot on predictions last Saturday I gave you guys the prediction that Bitcoin over Memorial Day Weekend had a very strong chance of popping up to 28 which is the top of the channel that I've drawn and shown over multiple videos over the last month and over the next 24 hours that's exactly what it did which was awesome it shot up exactly to 28 500 and I also said on that video that if we got a break back above that channel that would be our confirmation that it will go to 34k so that's what we're watching next we hit the top of the channel we pulled back a little bit which I think is a buy Zone because I do think that this move up to 28 was the confirmation that I was looking for for the bigger move that I think is about to happen so little pullback now next leg up coming soon of course there's absolutely no guarantee of that we'll have to see what it does if it broke down beneath the pullback of the last candle then that's where you stop loss out and you see what's going to happen next nobody's got a crystal ball let's dive into Tesla now you know that we started the trade at 153 dollars and the end goal always was 193 but when we got back up there and we began to vacillate in that region and we broke out but then we came back below I did a video and I said guys it's hard but I'm gonna hold because I think we're gonna break out above the channel That was a super hard decision to make because if I were just going to go buy the basic technicals we would have hit our Target and it would have been time to take profits but I had a gut feeling that Tesla was going to remain strong the confirmation breakout above the channel likely means that we're going to at least 215 with the possibility of 233 still being on the table right now got to watch it very carefully and then yesterday I did a comprehensive video on the AI stock c3a I and I said guys this thing is going to take off Tuesday it's going to hit my Target price of forty one dollars and that's exactly what it did we had a run up to 41 and around 50 cents and now it's pulled back a little bit but we still have room up on this and I was talking to Larry Jones this morning and we were chatting about c3ai and I made this point to him if these guys simply just don't utterly screw up these earnings this thing could pop to fifty dollars I do think that it's very lofty they've got tons of fundamental problems but they're the right company at the right time and so if they did decently if they just didn't do terribly if they just did decently with these earnings I think we'll get a bigger pop up to the next level will be very interesting to see I am going to take some profits going into close I made a ton of money already on calls and on the shares so I'm gonna hedge my bet I'm gonna take a little bit of profits but I'm definitely going to hold some over into Wednesday when they report earnings to see what happened happens next there's just more opportunity to the upside with AI we just have to accept that and there's a ton of companies that are super interesting to talk about I'm going to dive into two big tech companies that I think are going to be absolute winners these two are two that I think might hit their all-time highs in 2023 that's why I've separated them I'm going to talk to you about them today but I would love to have made a video about CRM these guys Salesforce I think it's an AI play I think it's going to be bullish keep an eye on that I'm in CRM don't have time to break it down because of what I'm going to cover today but there's stocks that are going to be firing off this week I think CRM might be one of them there's definitely risks looming over the market I covered the debt ceiling yesterday it's not been finalized anything can happen between now and around June 5th to the 9th where everything should come to a head so we don't know whether we're just going to push up into a firestorm of selling we just don't know so you've got to be you've got to take cautions you don't want to be all in on one play you don't want to be be too bearish or too bullish I've been saying for months that we're going to behave like buffaloes we're going to be selective we're going to graze on opportunities that's how I've been doing it and the best place to be grazing has been the AI stocks these have captivated Wall Street and they're simply pushing higher all right this is the stocks with Josh show as always I want to thank you guys for hitting the like I want to thank you guys for being such a great Community I enjoyed chatting with everybody in the uh MooMoo chat group this morning the New York event that I've got scheduled for June 7th was a huge success I got some feedback from those who are managing the database and said that it completely filled up within an hour and I was also told that they had not sent out the confirmations of emails telling people whether or not they have got a ticket I believe that's going to happen in the next 24 hours so keep an eye on your email to make sure that you get the notification of whether you are able to attend it's going to be an incredible event I hope to see you guys there all right today I'm going to give you guys two stocks that I believe believe Wall Street is going to load up on and after Apple if this bull rally continues I believe that these are the two that are most likely to hit all-time highs in 2023. those two are Google and Microsoft they're just too well positioned to take advantage of the AI move and the institutional investment money with so much cash sitting on the sidelines are gonna choose these two companies to push up and they're just not going to stop they're going to probably continue to rise I'm going to get into the technicals on both and I think you're going to find potential areas for re-entry you're going to find potential areas where they're going to be a resistance and an ideal area to take profit if you're long I'm just going to tell you right now at the start of the video if you're on Google in Microsoft and you're just in it and you don't have any more money to buy and you're going to hold it for the next couple years I think you're going to do really really well with it I'm going to be giving some support and resistance to give some perspective on where it might go or places where you might be able to get back in all right let's start off by looking at Google the their CCE is 115 billion this is another company that's doing financially better than the US government with more money more cash on hand right now than the US government CCE is a financial term for cash or cash equivalent these guys are well positioned to position Google in the lead of the AI boom and they're the ones who are most likely to introduce AI to Everyday Americans on a daily basis their cloud services their popular search engine is simply going to allow them to just step right into that number one AI spot now if we look at the charts we see that Google fell to 83 dollars in November of 2022 and at that time I was buying regularly and Advising this community on YouTube to be buying I told everybody accumulation below 92 dollars I locked in profits at 108. shortly after that the stock pulled back to 102.63 now I sold because of the uncertainty in the markets I'm affected by it just like all of you so much fun I'm processing I'm thinking hey I should lock in some profits I've made a fair amount of money but I did tell everybody that if it broke back above 108 that was my spot to jump back in and it did that it ran up over 108 into 109 got back in and I said guys with this we have a confirmation that's going to hit 127 bucks a near 20 gain which it did now we've got a lot going on in the news again and there's a strong temptation to take profits again and that's why I'm making this video to share my thoughts with you guys on it big investment firms are threatening to sell their bags into strength but I have begun to see a path for Google to reach its all-time highs similar to Apple and I'm going to show you guys a chart that I gave you that when Google was 120 bucks it showed Google going up to 128 hitting resistance and then working its way back to 108. that is still very much a possible path for Google it doesn't mean though that Google will go any lower now check out this channel that I've drawn that would be right around the middle part of the channel where I could see it back testing and then working its way back up to 126. now that's just one potential path I want to lay on the table you can see in this chart I gave recently that I said Google would back test to 122 and then go back up which it did if we got buy volume and a close above 126 dollars right now it would utterly change the narrative and it would confirm to us that Google's going up right now and won't do any more back testing in the near future but another scenario could be a back test of 118 on this longer term Channel which I think could easily happen and then it could push up from there there is a path for Google to hit 135 dollars next I think it would pause around 131 there's a fair amount of resistance there but ultimately it would go between 135 and 140 in the days ahead the main takeaway is that the Google trade is going to remain bullish for the remainder of 2023 and ultimately get back to its all-time highs I believe at this moment in 2023. those are big predictions I know another big key is this if we get back to some of those areas 118 or even as low as 108 that's where I'm going to be a heavy buyer I'm not going to doubt it I'm not going to fear those are the levels that I would buy because I think the overall trajectory is ultimately higher in 2023 and in 2024. all right let's look at my second pick which is is Microsoft Microsoft is a very interesting company because these guys have a ton to gain with Bing chat GPT as well as an increase in the sale of personal computers geared towards people looking to take advantage of AI technology on a daily basis most of us have been using our phones and we've gotten away from even using laptops on a daily basis but AI could be a game changer for that scenario not to mention gamer upgrades coming down the pipeline with Xbox a growing section of their business they've got something to gain on multiple fronts and like Google they're currently wealthier than the nation sitting on a pile of cash which is super important this is what separates them from other stocks this is going to enable them to realize those AI goals now let's go into the charts when Microsoft was 250 bucks I predicted that it would hit 300 it did it Consolidated and I predicted that we were going to go back up to 315 which it did and it's been continuously climbing it seems that Microsoft is running up on momentum and it will hit at or very near all-time highs which I'm estimating would be at least around 345 dollars very very soon now I'm speculating that there could be some cool off after that and that Microsoft has the potential of coming all the way back to 300 on such a huge run-up that began largely in January of this year so up a little bit more than a drift down to key support potentially around September now those are just some loose speculations of how the price action might perform AI could surprise us the strength could shock us we could see a move up above all-time highs for Microsoft without that pullback to support but I think that we're going to hit that near all-time highs on Microsoft and then I think for some reason it's more likely that it could cool off I at least would love to see it cool off come back and hit this upward to send ending trend line and then continue up from there till the end of the year quick station break for the MooMoo Investment app today is one of the last days to take advantage of their offer to receive up to 20 free stock each stock could be valued at two thousand dollars there's a link in the top pin comment to get all of the details as well as the description of the video but the main reason why I love MooMoo is because I've got a great community over there called stock Josh fam so get your free stock you can start investing but then come find us and join the daily conversation there that are just great there's a couple picks I'm getting from my community that I'm thinking of jumping in on so I'm not the only one giving good information over on the chat group that I host come check that out if you can but in conclusion let me be crystal clear and I want you to quote me on this I know it's a bold prediction perhaps I'm feeling more bold with all this bullish movement but you're definitely missed the bottom on Google and Microsoft stock there is no path to an 83 dollar Google in the days ahead best case scenario and that's if it happens maybe 104 maybe 108 and there is no 213 dollar Microsoft ahead best case scenario in my eyes would be around 300 or a slight dip beneath somewhere between 295 and 300 that's the lowest that I can see it going right now now these things could always change and I would come out and say hey something changed something broke down but right now the fundamentals the technicals are aligning for an upward move till the end of 2023 for both of these companies and I had to come out and share them with you I could have talked about a number of stocks there's tons of opportunities that are firing off right now but I thought it was important that you guys have these at the top of your watch list because I think they're going to follow through like apple and possibly hit their all-time highs in 2023 but hey let's see what happens you guys know I love you thank you for hitting the like thanks to all of the new subscribers to joining this community I appreciate each and every one of you guys we're gonna see what happens with c three AI over the next 24 hours I think could be exciting we're gonna that one's gonna be exciting to watch anything is possible we could see a sell-off we could see a big pop it's going to tell us a lot about how this AI environment might continue over the next month we still have the debt ceiling not entirely resolved so we got to keep a close eye on that going in to the first couple weeks of June that's about it for today peace and blessings my friends we'll see you in the next video foreign [Music]

How did someone in 2018 when Bitcoin was less than $5,000 notice, spend $400 on this crypto that less than three years later would be worth over $4 million? They could have bought anything from Ethereum a flat screen TV or even their very own water park. Was all of this a coincidence or was there a secret to staying ahead of the markets that they knew that we did not? Today, I'll be exposing this truth by not only showing what this crypto investor is buying but uncovering what many other crypto millionaires and even billionaires are buying in this bear market. And to do this, we are going to be going whale hunting. No, not that type of whale hunting but looking for clues that these large crypto investors or whales leave behind when they buy crypto projects. In the hopes of us finding crypto projects that could potentially 1000x come the next bull market. (motivating music) To do this we'll be using a combination of four different tools. So before uncovering what I found with these four tools first we need to discuss why even do this in the first place. Let's say we know of an investor, Jeff and he's invested early in companies like Airbnb, Uber, and Facebook. Now this would suggest that he probably has a good inside look at what companies to invest in early. So what if we could see what he was investing in before everyone else? Well, in traditional investing that is near impossible. But with crypto and using the blockchain we can see what these crypto millionaires using their wallet addresses are buying. And that's because every transaction that's ever been recorded is saved on the blockchain but it's not as simple as following every large crypto wallet address to find these hidden projects. Some large crypto walled addresses aren't active anymore or others are actually that of exchanges like Binance or Kucoin. We are looking for active investors who have at least several million dollars in crypto and we can do this by using the first tool. Now, before getting into that first tool I wanted to announce that I'm launching the Side Hustle Society. This is a group where you can not only connect with other individuals but you can build your skills that help you earn more money with over seven hours of training across six different subjects with more to come, one of these being crypto. And we'll be doing group buy-ins, weekly, live streams and so much more. And to thank you guys for helping us save 100K subs I'll be giving a lifetime membership away to 10 of you. All you have to do is like this video and comment down below for your chance to enter for that. Now let's see what these crypto millionaires are buying. First, we need to head over to a site like Coin Market Cap look up any crypto of you're choosing. In this case, we're going to be using Arbitrum and that's because it's a fairly new crypto that just launched which means that there's more likely to be more active users on this platform. From there, we can click on the contract address and this is going to bring us to our first tool, the Block Explorer. Now, every crypto is going to be different but all you have to do is click on the contract address and it will take you to the appropriate one. Once on the Block Explorer, you can go to the holder's tab and you can see every investor of this particular crypto from largest to smallest. But looking at large crypto wallet addresses for breadcrumbs is only part of the equation because remember we're looking for actual investors that are active. But after looking I found a wallet address that had $53,000 worth of Arbitrum. And right away you can see this wallet is worth $1.5 million and has over a dozen different cryptos. However, we're not done because we need to see exactly what they're buying. And viewing wallet addresses portfolios inside of block Explorers isn't very easy to use and can sometimes feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. But we can paste this wallet address over in zapper.fi, the second tool. And from here we can get a nice breakdown of all of the different cryptos that are in this portfolio along with exact amounts. Now, there are quite a few tokens inside of this wallet but one in particular that I had not heard of before was that of Lyra, a decentralized protocol that has a market cap of $30 million. And what's interesting here is that out of his entire $1.5 million portfolio he only has $7,800 in this project which may sound like a lot, but to put this in perspective it would be like having $1,000 total to invest in crypto and only putting in $5 into this project. And this is only the tip of the iceberg. But let's move on to another wallet. Now, this wallet had $57,000 worth of Arbitrum and a little over a million dollars in total across the different projects it's in. Now, a crypto protocol that caught my eye was that of Vela Exchange, which this is a hybrid exchange on the Arbitrum ecosystem, and they have over $30,000 worth of this token, which is over 3% of their entire portfolio. So this is significantly higher than the other project that we looked at compared to the last portfolio but this entire process is very time consuming and there's actually a software that will do all of this heavy lifting for us. And this brings us to tool number three, whalestats.com. This tool pulls together top whales and lets us not only see what the wealthiest people are buying but also gives us an entire breakdown of their portfolio. So when looking at the top wallets on the platform right away you can see a wallet that's valued at over 44 billion. But the wallet that caught my attention had over a half a billion dollars in it and over a hundred different tokens. And this is where I wanted to start my search now right away. The most noteworthy part about this portfolio is that they have over $300 million in Shiba Inu. Now this sounds crazy, but since the launch price of Shiba Inu has increased by over 15000000% they could have actually gotten that $300 million from investing as little as 1500 bucks but I believe Shiba Inu has had its day for these types of returns. So I wanted to look at some smaller projects inside of the list. Moving down, you can see that he has over $12 million of incoming crypto transactions one of the top being $7 million worth of Matic. And I think Polygon Matic is a great layer too with a lot of functionality, but there's no way that project is going to 100x anytime soon. And to do so, it would have to increase by over $900 billion which is almost the entire net worth of crypto as a whole right now. But moving on to some of the smaller tokens it gets a bit more interesting. Now, he has some common metaverse projects such as Sand and Mana, but one project in particular that caught my eye was fetch.ai and he has $5 million worth. Now, this is an artificial intelligence project and the thing is with these AI crypto projects is I'm just not sure if I'm sold on them as a whole. Yes, AI does have some use cases but it seems like these crypto projects know that if they throw AI anywhere inside of their protocol that people will come to it almost as if it's like a marketing service. Now that being said he does own $5 million worth of this crypto, but once again $5 million to him would be the equivalent of if you had a thousand dollars to invest in crypto only putting in $10 into this project. So still very small amounts here but there's one tool that I may even like a bit better than Whale Tracker, and that's Whale Trades. And it does a combination of what the three other tools previously does except it shows live trades from about 15 major exchanges. And using this tool, I found a crypto wallet that has about $3.5 million worth of alt coins. Now, what's interesting about this wallet is that they have over 40 different projects now their top position is Sand which is worth a little over $300,000 and that's already on my watch list. Now moving down, you can see that they have some more familiar tokens such as Ethereum, Matic, Fantom, Mana, and I was familiar with a lot of these projects on the list until I got down into one in particular which is the KNS token or Kyber network which is a decentralized exchange on Ethereum and it's retraced by almost 90% with a market cap of over a hundred million dollars. So this is definitely a smaller project and I added it to my watch list. Now, one more small alt coin that I found in this portfolio was Synapse. And this protocol specifically focuses on crypto bridging and this helps facilitate transactions between large cryptocurrency projects. Now, I do have some other projects inside of my portfolio already that do have some type of bridge component but I don't have one that is solely focused on bridging as a whole. So I went ahead and I added this one to my watch list and the fact that it's at 150 million market cap and that may sound like a lot but my biggest crypto investment that I made back in 2020 was it a project that already at the time had a 200 million market cap that ended up over 60x-ing. But what about that crypto punks investor that made a 1000000% return on a $400 jpeg? Well, here's what I found after recovering his wallet address and looking inside, but we can see that he's still holding one crypto punk NFT worth 570K another NFT worth $32,000. And after that no crypto position amassing over $3,000. So what does this mean? Well, it doesn't really mean anything. He probably has multiple wallet addresses and this is fairly common, especially once one of his crypto wallet addresses got doxed. But what I'm doing not only with this crypto wallet address but other ones that I come across in my research is I'm taking them over to zapper.fi and I'm going to set up notifications. So if a large transactions occurs I can be notified immediately. But out of these projects which ones did I actually pull the trigger on to add to my portfolio? Well, the answer to that is none of them right now because I think that more important than the actual cryptos I mentioned in this video is the method in which I used to find them. Because none of these cryptos may take off. Some of them may, some of them may not but one of them will by continually using this method. But even if I am ready to purchase those cryptos on this watch list, it doesn't mean I will. And that's because I have seven very specific rules that I use to purchase cryptos inside of my portfolio and I'm waiting on one in particular to happen. So if you want to see those rules you can check out this video right here. But until then, thank you for joining me today and I'll see you next time."

(Massive Potential!!),üö® Join my private community now: https://jakegordon.lpages.co/jake-gordon/  My Twitter:  https://twitter.com/mrjakegordon,569.0,11326,419,there's going to be massive moves in the next Bull Run but in this video I want to give you my top five cryptos to buy for this month's June 2023 and some of them are going to have massive potential now I want to make a quick disclaimer first ignore the shorts I know I understand but number two most importantly do not look at these cryptocurrencies for July August September hey don't even look at them for next year we should be descending these top five coins that I'm going to go over in the likes of 2025 and some people say 2026 Bill run but ideally 2025 do not have a one week time from Horizon do not have a one month two months three months we're long-term players here so before I jump in and give you the juicy coins that I've picked out number one is you need exposure now firstly I make these lists not for you to go in fomo right we should first do our own research and ask yourself how many coins are we currently holding you guys all know I believe five to ten all coins that is and how much have we already got invested planning to invest for the guy that can only invest a hundred dollars a month that's fine fantastic you're doing better than 99 of people although together it's you know going to invest 10 000 per month it's going to depend the guy that invest in ten thousand dollars a month quick disclaimer you should probably just buy Bitcoin in theorem and a couple of other alts but they're a guy who needs to look at a speculative all coins but safe to make Futures games so let's jump in now number one is going to be hbar duh what did you expect we have most mirror Advantage here with its patent technology and its fit fee structures keep that in mind I'm probably too heavy on this and I'm openly honest about this but I do believe a new all-time high with hbar will be easy now the previous old time I was 57 cents or something if you look at it right now which we're going in the charts it's a minimum a minimum minimum to get to one dollar I think is absolutely easy a 20x or so super  easy you do the maths so when we jump into it and we see obviously the previous Autumn hi we're right back here at Square One dudes people would be killing to get a five cent H bar now some people believe I think the lock-ups in a couple of days then we're recording the circuit and Supply is going to go up that might create downward in fact it probably will create downward price action and that's fine remember your dcnn we're not trading these you can trade H bar for instance I wouldn't recommend it but you definitely can and there's been some Longs and shorts on The Daily but beyond a downward action and I do expect this to continue but remember if we DC all the way down to three two some people are even saying one cent that's fine because remember we're here for a dollar and if you get those prices at one two three God cents 30 40 100x if you get one cent I don't think we'll see that but if we do I don't complain of that dudes I don't complain in that so that's going to be number one just with all its use cases just with you know what everything else is going on with it with your team Etc don't like boring people without boring stuff because you guys already know but that's going to be number one H Bar number two is render this might come as a surprise to some of you guys because I don't really talk about it too much but it is a coin and a typical AI coin which I think is going to be super amazing but I'm slightly pissed at this one because I missed the trade on this when I was talking about it and I was looking at it and then it went under my nose so before I tell you why here's kind of what happened I mentioned this in the private community this coin just slapped underneath my nose it's pretty much essentially got confirmation 50 Cent it's pretty much 50 Cent it's pretty much five six x since then why most coins are going sideways if not down like H bar it has done absolutely fantastic and it just keeps going I'm slightly pissed because I'm on the fences I haven't actually bought it yet and it's only because I'm waiting for an entry again I should probably just DCA because obviously I'm here for 2025 but I really really was looking at the back here and I started talking about it and I never used my own guard again agenda care I never used it I'm pissed I'm not gonna lie but anyways it did well in 2021 I think it's going to be an easy easy easy easy 50 to go in from where it is right now the games are still juicy like you said a 50 Cent was way way better and I think as we all know AI is going to be the next narrative right so what's annoying to say whether you like this or not AI coins even without AI on them will go well what I mean by that is if they've got something to do with AI like we've seen main coins Etc just have a and their names and went fantastic I'm not telling you guys to buy them they're not good long-term plays but the big ones like fetch like ocean protocol like render I believe they're going to take a full storm AI is going to be the next narrative I'm not going to be missing out on this one I'm just waiting around to have some resistance again because I don't want to be buying a 2.50 if I can get a 1.50 heck one dollars because it has been rallying too long long even if it keeps going and is what it is I might have to take an L on this one but it just shows you the importance of these coins can go in a bigger market number two is qnc I missed this one out badly and the previous run but it's became one of my favorite results since I got invested time recording it's rallying literally literally again qnt is effin rallion like I'm mad man up five percent today it was literally literally literally a hundred dollars or so if you go seven days ago it was literally under a hundred dollars so it's up 21 in a week yeah in a beer market and we've always seen what Quant can do in the Beer Market at five extra short the pqr now obviously why I like it is the lengthy supply of 14 million if you actually look at the coins in circulation it's pretty much fully out what do you got 12 so all the coins are pretty much fully out obviously two million it's a lot of coins but just keep in mind if you look at H bar Etc level of hbar kind of loads of coins coming out loads of coins coming out inflation is pretty much none I wouldn't be surprised dudes if this hits 1.5 K Min by the next bill run therefore it gets a list on this top five now ethereum is going to piss a lot of people off and I'll tell you guys why it's expensive yes it's slow yes it's cost a hundred dollars to admit an nft sometimes hard to sell these Petty main coins that you guys were day trading on you absolute degenerates hopefully made some money and it costs that much so sometimes move ten dollars and I've not put that there lightly this is if and annoying for the small investor hey even me but myself and probably you guys you're mad because you missed it even though you don't want to admit it and you're trying to find excuses by ethereum slow etc etc and that's true but low-key you're just mad you missed it and I am too covered crash I was looking at this forty dollars fifty dollars I can't remember the exact price and I was looking at this I never bought it I remember watching a video of Alex Becker and he was talking about buying 3K Bitcoin and I can't remember much ethereum and he killed the trigger I said to my girlfriend at the time I was like oh yeah this is a bit this is that we're making a ton of money and anyways I was like let me just bag some and I never bought any it was too risky my older friends were like no no I just buy stocks dumbest decision so far of my short life I wish I bought it anyways I'm still buying it today at 1.8k you see me buy it in the previous run at 400 bucks I will continue to buy this thing under 2K maybe 2.5 k because I believe it's the easiest money possible in the next build run it's not going to give you the most returns absolutely not it's going to be an easy 5x I do believe it hits 10K if not more remember the big players if not already are trying to layer in they don't care about a thousand dollar fees right they really don't because they're moving millions of dollars it's deflationary I think still it's going to be more deflation right as time goes on they're gonna be burning As We Know there's going to be insane yield mechanisms there is going to be more nfts coming out in 2025 that are going to be absolutely crazy like we've seen in 2021 the fees are going to be absolutely ridiculous what do you think happens if you're holding ethereum how do you think this game works around cryptocurrency you guys are going to be making tons of money in ethereum yes it's not sexy yes it's too expensive some people can't even buy one and I feel free Duds 100 this is why we have multiple plays and you don't have to buy a philosorum but if you can get some some I think the goal should be small investors try and get half in ethereum really try over the next couple of you know bear Market two years or one year and a half or whatever just try and get a half and try and get 0.1 BTC again that's going to cost you a couple of grand it's not ideal but if you can scoop up that along with your small cap all coins you're not going to be sorry you did that you're not going to be sorry at all because it keeps us risk-free last one and this is a weird one firstly I'm not shelling Oaky X they're not sponsoring me they've tried to Etc but I haven't taken a deal with them as you know I'm very honest nordvpn and a couple of other guys do sponsor me continuously and if there's a new one I'm always open about it I'm not here to try and hide it's not my game and I don't really care it's a sponsor I like I'll tell you guys if you like it if not it doesn't matter so not paid by okiex they haven't given me a good enough deal yet but they're trying to keep it coming now this is a weird one because there's a few reasons why I actually like this like I said these guys really want additional deals with influencers like I said I hate using that word but that's just the way it is so they're trying to get me they're just not giving me to be honest they're not giving me enough money super transparent I want more money so I can buy more crypto so do you guys but they are starting to work with influencers even bigger than me and that's absolutely fine and I do want to be a part of Lucky X you just got to pay me more money it is what it is some people will hate to  hear that but that's just the game trust me if you had an audience you only want to you know shell I don't like using that word but you only want to give good products like nor VPN nobody feels bad about a VPN with all the extra solid Ethan exchange I like their exchange I have an account but I can only choose one exchange I'm gonna like try and get the most amount from my buck try and give you guys the best deal whether that's you know low fees etc etc because if not I'll just choose somebody else and I'm still on the fence with Oakley X kickline would be my main although I love Google and they just don't have any they just don't have anything unfortunately so okay X we're trying to do it maybe next week or next month we might have a deal but regardless why would I buy buy the coin is like I said hard with influencers and know they've got a ton of reserves they're users dudes take a look at this their users are growing literally millions per month if you look at February 6.8 March and one month 2.3 million users up on our 300 000 users in April it'll be interesting to see maze if it's a continuous growth but this is this is almost 30 million dudes almost 3 million uh monthly users in two three months it's absolutely insane I do believe they're going to be one of the biggest I think they're already the biggest in Australia again look at FTX although they collapsed and the difference is ftt coin you know before it collapsed was doing fantastic you just get to decide if you're taking profits if not so like I said their website visitors are growing look at the coin prices recently you probably haven't noticed this what the is going on here right again Gordon Gage called this absolutely perfectly here you had a confirmation of a sale but then you got in again it's fantastic this thing like I said it's just difficult not to mention this project when it was at 15 in the last six months and it's already 3xed it's kind of difficult to not buy that um because it's up so much but if you did it would be fantastic I do believe okx will do well in the next Bull Run it depends how many users they can keep and how they're treating them Etc if they start charging people crazy fees or locking up stuff like FDT obviously and Celsius did although it's more of an exchange just like FDX was just keep that in mind it's just a fantastic play I think in my opinion although a lot of people don't like exchange coins and I understand why but again we're invested in a coin if the company is doing well it's kind of easy to tell where a client can go look at binance for example in BNB I remember that coin was at fifteen thirty dollars it rallied all the way up to what it was a bigger binance like five six hundred I might be butchering that massively um but I think it did in the previous build run 635 maybe skiff 7 on trading view absolutely insane I'm not saying you know this is going to go there I'm not saying that at all but I am saying there's more gains in this by the next bill run even though it's already rallied up so far you just have have to look at what your risk allocation allows for fill up your main bags first but yeah that was my top five and super enjoying this one I'm probably going to come up with an AI one soon just because I really like AI coins and Ranger like I said is what I'm looking at although I've been looking at the last six months I never pulled the trigger but just keep that in mind but I would like to know what are your top five coins for June and by 2025 remember not by one month just keep that in mind and full disclaimer for the person that says Jake what about this coin what about this coin it's a top five there's other coins that hold do you already know that just keep that in mind I don't want to make this video too long I'm bored you guys but those are my top five I'll see you in the next video take care

be happier than the person that loves the destination most of us are here to get rich quick and what's great is that desired destination has put us all on a journey that involves learning about a new speculative asset class how the traditional Financial system works how absolutely criminal central banks are in what it takes to build and maintain wealth over time so some of us will reach the desired destination of getting rich and one of two things will happen one we get rich and we are not able to maintain it and end up right back where we started or to we get rich and maintain and grow our Newfound wealth for the rest of our lives and for our legacies to come the difference between the two outcomes is determined by whether we are the person that loves the journey or the person that lives the destination so for some of us that are still focused on the destination we need to have a mind shift to instead learn to love the journey and love the process of build building and maintaining wealth not just gambling on cryptos to try to luck out and strike it big people focused on the destination of getting rich try to take shortcuts by giving their money or crypto to someone else to invest on their behalf instead of investing the time to learn about the industry and end up getting scammed because there are no legit crypto investment mining or yielding Services absolutely zero there are scammers everywhere pretending to be me guy from coin Bureau bit boy meet Kevin Kathy Wood Russell Brand anyone in the crypto or financial space or who has any substantial following at all and they lie by trying to trick you into giving them money to invest mine yield or even sometimes they claim to have fake services to recover lost or stolen funds all of those are 100 scams and to learn more about them check out this video guide by clicking on the link above another shortcut people who are too focused on the destination take is by maybe actually making a great trade realizing massive gains and then they never sell or take profits because they didn't have a profit taking strategy beforehand which you can check out this step-by-step guide on how to do that by clicking in the link above or maybe they didn't learn about the process of how to take profits in crypto because sometimes it's not as easy as selling it on coinbase directly for a stable coin or cash and transferring it to your bank account and then the value crashes down to leaving them back at square one here's the deal we cannot take shortcuts on our journey to True wealth and prosperity we need to invest our time to gain knowledge about what wealth is all aspects about generating wealth and maintaining wealth over time and most importantly we need to earn it we need to truly deserve it we need to give to others provide value to others make a contribution to humanity in the World At Large that is how we manifest true wealth Prosperity happiness and fulfillment because anyone who has realized a significant amount of monetary gain who has been able to maintain it for a significant period of time will tell you that money alone won't leave you you happy or fulfilled when a ton of money is not coupled with a sense of purpose gratitude gratefulness healthy fulfilling relationships in a balanced life overall a lot of money just makes our problems more existential and what's great what I really love about crypto is it inspires a lot of people who want to get rich to inadvertently start a journey that they will either try to shortcut rush through and most likely not end up where they intended to go or their Journey leads them down a path where along the way they learn how to practice gratitude for the things we currently have learn how to generate well how to provide value to the world find a sense of purpose and help others on their journey to a fulfilling life so why am I highlighting this fact the fact that we are on a journey and we need to fall in love with the journey and not focus on the destination if we are actually going to make it because I think this bear cycle might be longer than we originally hoped and there are two ways we can react to this get discouraged and quit or get excited because we may have another 18 to 24 months or so to build our skills increase our income in DCA or dollar cost average into crypto and other Investments at low prices over a longer period of time so when the next Bull cycle comes which it always does it always comes back at some point we can reap the rewards we will have truly earned and will have learned and grown so much along the way instead of arriving and staying at our desired destination we may decide to continue life's journey because we have fallen in love with the journey and have become lifelong Learners that constantly pursue growth who continue to have more and more to give and contribute to others and the world hello I'm crypto Casey and in this video we are going to explore my random wild guess my latest prediction about what I think may play out Market wise for the rest of 2023 and what 2024 may have in store and why we may have until q1 of 2025 and Beyond to prepare for the next full cycle let's hit it [Music] please be sure to check out our sponsors I trust Capital tanjem wallet and Morales Money Trade cryptocurrencies tax-free within your own individual retirement account or IRA with I trust Capital invest in this amazing alternative to Ledger wallets called tangent wallet that never reveals your private keys to anyone ever it's a hardware wallet that is the size of a credit card multi-currency multi-chain super easy to set up and it lets us trade all coins faster more securely and conveniently to take profits on the go and find undervalued altcoins before they pump using morale's money a tool that connects directly to several different blockchains like ethereum arbitrum polygon and more that allows us to set up filters and alerts to create our own unique trading strategies before the next mind-blowing altcoin season so be sure to scroll down and use links below to access the correct and official sites as well as redeem any special offers they have for us sweet my random wild guess is that the markets will continue to be driven by the federal reserve's actions which will involve them continuing to hike rate once to three more times before finally pausing into late summer or fall they will hold the pause throughout the rest of the year and will not start lowering at all in 2023 this will cause more Banks to collapse and merge with larger Banks like JP Morgan commercial real estate will melt down debt everywhere will continue to mount and become more expensive and like we discussed a while ago over the next six months 40 percent of Americans said they would need to use a buy now pay later loan between now and then over 27 percent of which said they would need it to buy groceries they will need to take out a loan to afford to eat to survive which begs the question of whether or not at least in bigger metropolitan areas is civil unrest on the horizon for 2023 or 2024. we shall see what this means for the crypto markets for the rest of 2023 my random wild guess is we will continue to experience largely sideways movement with a random short stints of run-ups and certain categories of cryptos like at the beginning of 2023 we had a mini Surge and useless altcoins with AI in the names from the chat GPT craze then a mini surge in meme coins like Pepe and Floki as of late with China becoming more crypto positive useless Chinese coins are popping off and like we discussed the other day the next surge could possibly be with gaming AR VR and metaverse coins with Apple's reveal of some new Cutting Edge AR VR related Tech on June 5th at the WWDC so if you're a short-term gambling Trader throughout the rest of the year you can try your hand at predicting the next narrative in trying to front run Catch the Wave and sell for potential gains otherwise choosing an amount of money you want to invest over time and choosing a specific frequency that you're going to invest in doing it consistently over time usually works best in the long run which is called dollar cost averaging so for example you decide to buy fifty dollars worth of bitcoin every Monday at 9am no matter what the price is and DCA or dollar cost averaging helps reduce your exposure to price volatility cool another thing to keep in mind about 2023 is the rollout of the new fed now payment system this July which is the foundation on which a cbdc or Central Bank digital currency will be built this is the beginning of the end of any control and freedom we have over our money and property which is why it's so important for us to get politically active because regardless of your political party there are candidates on both sides that are against cbdc's and unless they get into office the global Elites plan to enslave us all by controlling how and where we spend our money will come to fruition and if you don't know the gravity of a central bank digital currency being distributed and enforced check out this video guide by clicking on the link above next now my Ram random wild guess for 2024 this will be an interesting year as we've got the most important U.S presidential and congressional election as it relates to bitcoin so we will start being bombarded on the news and social media with political campaign ads which if you haven't yet check out this video guide on how we can get politically active to support pro-crypto regulations and politicians in just five minutes by clicking on the link above what will be interesting this time around is the fact that we know media has been manipulating and censoring a lot of information about political candidates like by saying no one noteworthy is running against Biden so the Democrats will have no primary debates when we've got pro-bitcoin Robert F Kennedy Jr ramping up his campaign to rival Biden and now we have Elon Musk and Twitter rivaling the big media Mafia letting candidates like Ron DeSantis address pretty much the entire world directly anyone who wants to tune in and listen on Twitter without the restrictions and parameters imposed by the big media Mafia and there are rumors of trump rejoining Twitter so yeah 2 Twitter Media news it's all going to get extremely political leading up to the election another important event to keep in mind for 2024 is the Bitcoin having taken place around April or May of 2024 and if you don't know what that is you can check out my video guide for beginners by clicking on the link above basically a lot of hype will start building up before the Bitcoin having event around January 2024 or so and sometimes that creates some surges and cryptos then the 12 to 18 months following a Bitcoin having event historically we see the Bitcoin price reach new all-time highs now I'm not sure if we would experience this in 2023 or 2024 or even at all but since the FED has increased interest rates too fast too high for too long it could cause a sharp painful compressed period of hyperinflation before falling back down to their two percent Target or even lower because since they default from the U.S debt ceiling has been averted this sovereign debt bubble we are in along with the rest of the world cannot be escaped it can only be worked through and the only way out at this point is for the FED to inflate the debt Away by devaluing the currency and this is one of many reasons why I think the fed and government at large is actively working to destroy the U.S and global economy at large another reason being that they want as many people as possible to be reliant on welfare so they vote to keep Biden in office so they can finish their destruction plan over the next five years the ultimate goal being to force everyone to use the US's Central Bank digital currency where they control the entire world's money however another Trend that will continue to gain momentum through the rest of this year and 2024 is the dollarization and deglobalization more countries will continue to turn away from the dollar and even within the United States we will face fracture between states and the federal government with Governors like Ron DeSantis Banning the use of cbdc's in the State of Florida at the end of the day I think all of this just keeps making a more and more compelling case for Bitcoin in that it's clear that we need neutral open inclusive Global Financial infrastructure where we can all truly own and completely control our property instead of relying on useless corrupt third parties like central banks their political puppets and corporate cronies so if my random wild guess that we have around 18 more months of largely sideways movement in the crypto markets until around q1 of 2025 when I randomly wildly guessed the next Bull cycle will start we need to fall in love with this crazy journey in this insane macro environment and start investing time and energy in learning about this new asset class practicing interacting with web3 technology like decentralized exchanges crypto wallets and more to treat this extra time we may be afforded in this bear Market as a gift in our journey to wealth and prosperity and one of the most important steps we can take as beginners and experts alike to help protect us in our wallets when getting familiar with DFI tools and transacting online is by downloading a free browser extension called wallet guard wall guard acts as a security companion to to our crypto wallet of choice so we can browse the internet and interact with web 3 more securely I've been using it for a year now and it's been working great popping up warnings helping me check everything before transacting so it's definitely worth checking out and giving it a go in this crazy macro environment when interacting with smart contracts like fermenting nfts when accessing the site wall guard's phishing protection layer executes and warns you if the website might be harmful if it was created recently and has a low trust score and if you proceed to do so with caution and when we do before attempting to verify a transaction with our wallet a second layer of protection is executed with a clear human readable warning about what exactly will happen if you decide to proceed with the transaction like if it's going to drain your wallet instead of actually minting an nft it can also detect and will notify you if the site is making several attempts to

well going forward and I personally hold these coins in my portfolio I believe that these coins are going to help me build my multi-million dollar portfolio going into the next Bull Run and that's something that I just wanted to share with you guys with that said nothing in this video or any of my other videos is an endorsement for you to go out and buy crypto right you guys have to do your own research I am simply telling you what I am doing in this market with that said on top of it I am not a financial advisor I'm just a guy sitting in a hotel room talking about cryptos that I'm particularly excited about let's jump straight into this video briefly touching on the reasons why I think that the crypto markets are gonna do pretty well going forward first of all we have a lot of talk around the town the crypto town that people are bracing for impact the market could see an explosion if China lifts its ban on crypto now right now from my understanding this is pure speculation but I would say this is probably going to happen as we see the Western countries England Australia earlier and America all turning a blind eye towards crypto having too much of a harsh standpoint on it just a few days ago we saw Australia stop people from being able to on and off board from binance using a bank transfer which is absolutely ridiculous in my eyes I think these Western countries are going to get left behind because crypto in my opinion is similar to the internet that we saw many moons ago and I think it's ridiculous they're not trying to keep up with the rest of the world and countries like China the Middle East and a number of other countries out there I believe are going to see the potential in this space and are going to actually look more favorably towards this Market going forward and these sorts of things could be the start of the next Bull Run if they happen now like I've said on this channel many times I don't believe that we're currently in a bull run we may be just starting out or we may have some other legs downwards so anything I'm talking about in this video has the potential to drop significantly if not go to zero we are also talking about some meme coins in today's video which of course hold the most amount of risk but they have a much higher risk to reward ratio with that said guys there are also other issues in the market like the debt ceiling which may be hit very soon in the next few days which could spell disaster in the short term for the overall market and we do still see a massive correlation between the S P 500 and Bitcoin itself and as you know Bitcoin tends to dictate what the rest of the Market's going to do with that said we do see meme coins basically decoupled from the market over the last couple of weeks which has seen some incredible absolutely wild gains we've captured a lot of those both here on the Channel with multiple 10 to 100 x's and also in my private group so if you do want to come over and join that private group there's a link down there in my description it's an awesome Community you get to see my trades my portfolios and you have other like-minded people doing exactly the same thing and it doesn't matter whether or not you're a beginner or you're Advanced there is something for everyone in that group so if you don't like it within the first three days you can simply drop me or the team a DM and we will give you a full refund no questions asked now with that said let's jump into all right first of all of course Bitcoin and ethereum are my number one place right those are the biggest positions in my portfolio I continually dollar cost average and add the profit that I make for example from meme coins into these two coins meme coin specifically into ethereum other plays like Leverage positions that sort of stuff into Bitcoin I am continually growing these positions and I would just make this video solely about Bitcoin and ethereum but I know that's going to piss a lot of people off so I'm not going to do that today but always those are my biggest positions that won't change when the ball run comes believe you me I'm taking profits from everything with that said let's move on to our first coin today and that is tenant now this was a pre-sale over on Dao maker down maker is one of the best launch pads out there some of the returns that they've had is absolutely incredible and I don't think tenant is going to be any different now this is a very interesting project a large scale project here tenant implements a diverse proof of stake restake your staked assets to validate of smart contract Networks cured by an omni chain governance and we can see down here that the tenant ecosystem comprises of a stable coin a decentralized exchange native gauges a lending Market Ava which is a multi-chain AI powered web3 wallet that is the gateway to crypto for non-technical people around the world and there will also be third-party applications they have huge advisors like Josh who leads product at anchor which is another huge decentralized infrastructure protocol and you guys can go check that out for yourself we've spoken about anchor here on the channel before that's made awesome gains as well and we do have other advisors here and there is a huge roadmap that is taking place as we speak of course the project did just go live on seven different exchanges just a few days ago I was part of this pre-sale now of course like I said you have to go out and look into this but they have just under a hundred and eighty thousand followers right now launched on seven of the biggest exchanges out there and they have some huge Partnerships happening in this space as we can see from the price action there was a violent move of when this project was leased onto the market and what we've seen is actually a very nice sideways action from then on out there hasn't been any huge dump downwards which is good this is the kind of movements that we want to see here yes for some reason this isn't showing the actual all-time high but it did of course go higher than this that's a completely normal thing that we see on the launch day of a project and like I say all the time on this channel if you are trying to get involved in a newly launched project it's always best to sit on the sidelines and wait for a better opportunity rather than chasing that initial pump and right now we are seeing this sideways action which could result in explosive move upwards if the market stays bullish of course we've spoken about the things that may happen like the debt ceiling which could have a negative effect on the market so please do keep that in mind if you do want to learn more about tenant you can get over the coin market cap and over here you have all of the links to their website the Twitter and everything else that you need to know about this project again guys I am holding tenant myself so of course take that information as you will and let's move on to the next project now this is moonwell moonwell has an absolutely tiny market cap at 1.6 million circulating right they also have a larger market cap of fully diluted which is 25 million just under so there is a very small amount of this Project's token out on the market which could mean that there are further unlocks which push this price even lower but I do believe that this shows some potential as a moon bag for me the project is another lending protocol built on moonwell at the moment but what they are planning to do is launch on base which is coinbase's new ecosystem that they are launching coming relatively soon now again we have advisors for this project Justin Lee is former coinbase inventures we got Alex from Dapper labs tokensoft and Ledger we got again Elias here from coinbase and someone else from Sushi swap so huge investors and investments from coinbase Ventures coinbase Ventures invested into this project at a higher valuation than it is right now this gives me an idea I'm just speculating and guessing best Ventures invested moonwell planned to launch on base which is obviously coinbase's project this is all pushing towards a narrative where coinbase has a lot to do with this project which could result in the future of a listing potentially on coinbase now I have absolutely no idea if that's going to happen there's a high probability that it will not happen but I'm willing to put a small amount of my investments into this project slowly dollar cost averaging because I believe there is huge upside potential again I don't know but today I did decide to buy some moonwell dollar cost averaging into my bag I am down from my initial investment and by dollar cost averaging at this price I bring down my overall cost basis which is something that I want to do with projects that I intend to hold for the long term now moving on from moonwell we have xtp another project that I am down on since I started slowly investing into this if you have been following my channel for a while you know my investment strategy for my long-term portfolio is simple DCA as the price falls down I can dollar cost average into the project bringing my cost basis down down meaning the second there is a bounce I'll be in profit much quicker than if I had just put all of my investment right in at the very start so that's what I personally do xtp currently sit just under a 40 million dollar market cap for fully diluted and just under 5 million for the circulating market cap now tap is of course an exchange token it's the governance token for their exchange and they are fully regulated and licensed which is something that I want to see and they do have 13 000 followers over on Twitter fully regulated in Gibraltar and their app is to seamlessly send receiver and manage your money and crypto all in one place now the reason why I want exposure to this is we've seen so many times exchange tokens do extremely well don't get me wrong we sometimes see exchange tokens do absolutely terribly like FTX going to pretty much zero those are possibilities we don't know if that's gonna happen for xtp or not I'm putting a little bit of money into it because I see potential upside and of course we've seen this a number of times on the channel BNB coin bit gets coin and a bunch of other exchange tokens all have done very very well in this space so I believe that if we do head into another bull market xtp can see some price action going upwards but of course it all revolves around the overall market and whether or not we can push out of this little bear Market space that we're in I of course also dollar cost averaged into this today with my own personal funds now moving on to another exchange this time it's a decentralized exchange it's Vella this is a decentralized Perpetual exchange so you can trade Futures using your metamask or your non-custodial wallet I believe that this is going to do very well we see GMX which is really the leader in this space at around a 500 million dollar market cap and this is during a bear market so I believe that GMX can go much higher from where it is today and in turn I believe that Vela can also do the same I think that vela's user interface is great I think the product is great right now they haven't launched the mainnet they were in beta and when they were in beta there was an opportunity to create volume on The Exchange in order to get yourself an airdrop and that's something that I did and brought to you guys here on the channel I also hope develop in my personal portfolio and our dollar cost averaged into it today because I believe that there is still upside potential for this in and around maybe a 10x in this space no one really knows how far the next Bull Run can go but again slowly dollar cost averaging for the long term when we're in a space like this which is exactly what helped me in the last bear Market to grab some awesome prices for projects for example cardano was one of the biggest returns that I made in the bear Market from Simply paying attention and dollar cost averaging now with that said let's talk a little bit quickly about the meme coins and some opportunities in this space Pepe today is up 4.36 and for me this Sparks a little bit of interest because this may mean that the meme coins can go on another run if Pepe does continue to show strength I do believe that Pepe acts as the Bitcoin for the meme market right now in this season that we're in so the way Bitcoin if it moves up we nearly always see other coins like ethereum follow it now we're seeing the same thing with Pepe if Pepe moves down we see the meme coin Market move down Pepe moved sideways we see the meme coins go sideways Pepe moves up we then start to see meme coins go up again so there are two that I want to bring up today one of which I did bring up in my private group This Is MeMe Dao today they sit at a 1.6 million dollar market cap and basically what they are is a meme coin facilitator and they plan to hold buy and distribute meme coins amongst the holders of meme Dao so basically holding this coin will give you access to other meme coins that the community decides to buy and distribute amongst the holders of course this is a meme coin it's super risky we don't know what's gonna happen we can check out the shorter term price action here you can see like a lot of meme coins it did have a very nice initial pump here pushing down to find some support Here and Now what I think is good to see is a slow push upwards a steady growth upwards which could show some potential going forward so definitely go out and check out this coin again I personally hold this in my portfolio and then moving on to another coin that I have spoken about here on the channel before it's magic Sheba starter now this launched very recently right now sitting at a fully diluted market cap of 1.2 million and the circulating market cap is extremely low right now at 150 000 so there is a lot of room for this still to grow you can see a very similar chart here an initial pump downwards finding some support and then heading upwards here something that I like to see essentially what magic Sheba starter are doing is becoming a launch pad on shiberium once aberian goes live they will Bridge the tokens from ethereum which they're currently on over to shiberium and then they'll start to incubate and launch projects directly here and then by holding the coins you get access to different tiers in the launch pad now in the last Bull Run we saw massive returns being involved in launch pads and I do believe that this still shows some opportunity going into the next Bull Run no guarantees especially this is a launch pad mixed with meme coins all right so there's no guarantees here very high risk High reward potential of Investments going to absolute zero but I personally know that I'm still currently holding this in my portfolio as we speak and with that said guys like all of the coins and projects and ecosystems and anything that I hold in my portfolio I plan to take profits all right I'm not one of those influencers who comes out and tells you that I have Diamond hands and I would never sell anything and then later on a couple of months later someone finds out that I've been selling I do take profits so when I get into something early and the price moves up I take profits from it that's how I believe we make money in this market I don't believe in having a hundred percent of my assets in crypto I don't believe in Diamond hands I don't believe in any of that I believe in trying to make as much profit as I possibly can so I can diversify yes into other cryptocurrency projects but also into stocks and shares and of course the property market so that's what I do here on this channel and if you guys do want to stay up to date with that sort of thing I would love for you to join the community by just simply smashing the Subscribe button and I will hopefully see you guys in the next video peace

what are my plans for those Investments obviously I need to say before we start this video I own the coins that we're going to be talking about and as always you can find a full disclosure statement of all the coins that I own and all my Venture Capital investments in the description of the video also I am a fan of making money I buy things with the intention of selling them at some point news flash right also I'm not buying these today these are positions that I've either been consistently buying into over the previous weeks or months or have purchased in the last few weeks so let's do this let's talk about first off Bitcoin obviously Bitcoin plus drill a bit more into this right it's like this a little more interesting and juicy you see right now I believe we're at a interesting phase in the market we're at the start of a new market cycle cautiously optimistic here these are the very earliest phases of the bull market U.S recession fears could still weigh heavy on us later this year and at least slowest down or maybe derail us but so long as Bitcoin trades under 30k I'm interested in stacking Bitcoin they're over 30k probably gonna slow down or even stop buying Bitcoin with fresh cash at this point I will be looking for better Roi elsewhere and other coins Bitcoin next cycle looking at like 150k or something like that for a top and that's like a 5x was not bad but not insane for crypto right I will still acquire Bitcoin during that time when I stop putting fresh cash in I won't completely stop right because I do receive Bitcoin from things like affiliate programs and I of course move altcoin profits into Bitcoin so do keep that in mind but I probably won't be putting any fresh cash into BTC I will watch it take some money off the table as well on a portion of my BTC stack when we are trading over a hundred K because why the heck not rough plan anyway now let's talk about Avalanche so the avax token I've recently basically doubled my avax position buying in around 18 of the intent tension to flip it at around thirty dollars we'll see how that works out obviously my existing position the other half of my avax coins I'm aiming to hold a little bit longer right into the cycle but Apex I'm doing some pretty awesome things recently which made me take a big interest in taking that position we're seeing a big increase in Daily users we're seeing a big increase in developer activity the recent Evergreen subnet announcement that was also a really big deal that was basically the intention to allow institutions an easy path to be able to build blockchain infrastructure on an Avalanche subnet recent expansion moves by Avalanche I've also seen some some really big Partnerships we have big Japanese gaming partnership for example an entry into the South Korean market following a big data company partnership recent news also that Avalanche nailed down a partnership with alibaba's cloud service called cloudverse This is to allow Alibaba users to be able to create and then to be able to of course deploy blockchain based metaverses pretty cool right and was also announced last week that Avalanche and ethereum now have a new non-custodial Bridge solution for moving usdc back and forth across the chains thanks to a new tech Solution by usdc parent company sir can I look in my mind Avalanche is doing all the right things the question is will it be enough to matter considering the current market conditions obviously fingers crossed that it will the third coin is arbitrum first can I say that the ARB token is a useless governance token I know that I understand second let me say that this doesn't necessarily matter as much as some might like to think that it does it can still pump it can still make money there's lots of useless governance tokens like uni swap right my thought process is basically this arm trims exploding it's doing more transactions than ethereum on most days it's seeing strong user growth is seeing strong engagement stats Builders are showing up to the arbitrary Network in a CIA serious way in many ways I feel like arbitrum is a blue chip quality piece of technology whose token is not currently trading at a Blue Chip Price this is one that I've been adding to weekly since it started trading on the open market I'll be looking to at least double my money on this that's kind of the intention of this arbitrim position now before I talk about the last coins let me just take a quick moment to tell you about my Weekly Newsletter it's called wealth Master you probably heard mention once or twice if this isn't your first time with the channel now if you're the kind of person who wants to find those money making opportunities in crypto you want to stay up to date with the latest of what's happening in this market and what it all means but you know you got the job you got the kids you got the wife you a life you want to try and live then this is the newsletter for you my team and I spend about 40 hours every single week it's our job to do it right making this newsletter packed full of crypto Alpha for you that you can just read in about like 10 minutes sounds like a pretty good deal right join our 65 000 weekly readers and sign up for free for free using the link in the description now let's talk about the next coin and list here which is spool now this is actually one that I previously owned then capitulated on during the bear Market it happens I am now back on to the spool train making two new purchases in the last two weeks of this altcoin now this is a low cap altcoin right one that I think has high potential but also a riskier play so I'm not risking a giant amount of my Capital on it's like 0.3 percent or something in my portfolio right now so just a little little nibble right I think a 10x not out of the question here for this one at least that's what I'm thinking as a Target but I'm also prepared to just you know lose my shirt on it if that's what the market decides right that's why I'm not risking a huge amount of money on it I really started paying attention to spool again once they expanded onto the arbitrary Network because I've been using the Arbitrage Network myself right and then they announced their V2 which also sparked a bit of Interest now spool has a focus on institutional defy adoption for their crypto native of yield strategies the app itself super easy to use basically deposits stable coins into risk adjusted pools you can decide you want to go high risk or low risk right and then sit back and wait for the money to roll in which is a pretty cool idea the spool token is a real yield coin with platform fees going largely to stakers now the next coin is one that is not something that I technically bought recently I invested at the pre-sale late last year but it's on my radar once again because right now they're doing their public node sale and the nodes are going to start making me money pretty soon so that's exciting miria so it's miria is the one by the way miria is a layer 2 ethereum Network purpose built for gaming already has some pretty impressive user stats million registered users we have more than 250 different games actually building on their Network the network offers a zero gas fee experience for users which of course is the friction that you need to get out of the way to make the game is fun to play 9 000 transactions per second along a zero feet nft minting so all the kind of right stuff that's really perfect for gaming right now the nodes that I bought let me earn Myriad tokens and or nfts for my work of helping to secure the network personally I think layer 2 space is getting pretty damn crowded with consensus's new one and coinbase's new one and all the other new ones but for me the reason I bought the nodes was because I thought it could be a good bet on owning a piece of gaming infrastructure instead of trying to bet on a particular game because while there have been some pretty cool games that have made me some money sometimes a lot of others have also lost money a lot of games are trash that I invested in though they turned up being trash right they looked very promising at the start right so maybe owning nodes in a gaming ecosystem might be a better bet that pays off that's my thought process anyway and that's why I bought some area nodes and next let's talk about one that I have not bought yet but I'm definitely keeping an eye on for a flip and that of course is the newest blockchain the new kid on the Block sui this fancy blockchain thing was built by some of the people who worked on Facebook's Novi before us Regulators came along and shut that down now sui is basically an Aptos sibling and both are supposedly Solana Killers now sui is fast at a theoretical 297 000 transactions per second but I don't so much care about that and I'm not sure the Market's super going to care about that at the moment either what I'm interested in is to watch this for a flip although I'm not biting at the current prices ideally I would like to see something like I don't know 50 cents maybe something like that depending on market conditions if I see it come down to that kind of price I might pull the trigger because I feel like the VCS the whales they're all going to run it up at some point anyway this one's on the watch list for now so waiting and watching for a tastier entry price okay that's it subscribe now see you next time [Music] thank you [Music]

summer is coming at least according to project founder Charles hoskinson cardano founder Charles hoskinson has shared an over optimistic vision for the future of cardano let's dive into the details and I'm curious your take in a recent video the crypto veteran hoskinson talked about cardano summer claiming that the blockchain's native token Ada could surpass Bitcoin could surpass ethereum could surpass all other cryptocurrencies this summer thanks to a series of updates and proposals set to be released in the coming weeks one of the most significant updates is the CIP 1694 proposal which aims to revolutionize cardano's on-chain governance infrastructure and turn the network into a truly decentralized gov government The Proposal is set to be integrated in the upcoming Voltaire update and will allow any user to submit a governance action hoskinson also talked about cardano's ongoing effort to measure and quantify decentralization using metrics such as the genie and Nakamoto coefficients these metrics would provide valuable insights into cardano's level of decentralization basically what Charles is saying is that cardano is one of the few crypto projects which has always geared itself towards decentralization bitcoin's decentralized ethereum's decentralized institutions realize that that Bitcoin and ethereum are Commodities there are a lot of crypto currencies that aren't it's not necessarily clear that they're Commodities but after cardano's updates it's going to hit a level of decentralization and could be adopted by Major regulatory bodies worldwide because of it by using these indicators to assess these centralization policy makers could formulate informed regulation and differentiate between cryptocurrencies as either Commodities or protocols based on their decentralization Avalanche doing big things you might not even realize this Avalanche adds native Euro stablecoin Ava Cloud Avalanche is making moves to attract developers and defy liquidity with its latest feature rollout so what exactly is going on with Avalanche why are Avalanche holders excited well developers on layer 1 Avalanche this week launched what they're calling Ava Cloud Ava cloud is built as a launch pad for deploying and scaling no code fully managed custom blockchains which Avalanche calls subnets subnets are analogous to Cosmos consumer chains which are connected to the cosmos hub using replicated Securities but speaking more on Ava Cloud specifically the product Suite comprises an interoperable blockchain Builder with managed validators and Analytics tools it is aimed at businesses that want to launch blockchains quickly with minimal overhead costs currently Avalanche touts the in-game shrapnel and Korea marketing platform SK Planet among its early developers and as I said with Ava Cloud Avalanche has launched a Euro stable coin coincidentally circled the issuer of the second largest stable coin on ethereum usdc actually multi-chain announced that its eurobact token Euro c is now natively available on the Avalanche C chain making its first foray into multi-chain expansion as I hinted at awesome to see this is a crypto protocol that many have forgotten about but on certain metrics they've never been doing better active subgraphs on the graph's mainnet of 26 percent quarter over quarter over the past five quarters the number of subgraphs launched on the graph protocol's mainnet has grown steadily at the end of q1 there were 776 active subgrats on the mainnet up to 26 percent quarter after quarter I like it do not count out ethereum this is an interesting metric there is no eth to trade well ethereum exchange balance drops to a five-year low the eth balance decline began September 2022 dropping significantly in November and December after the downfall of FTX people removing their coins from exchanges this is that five-year low five years back it was above this level interesting to see ethereum getting taken off exchanges like this and of course this probably has a lot to do with where ethereum is today compared to five years ago staked ethereum deposits just hit a new all-time high of 22.2 million do you stake your ethereum Aptos making big moves NBC Universal and Aptos Labs team up on a web 3 game for Nicholas Cage's Renfield Aptos Labs has partnered with NBC Universal to create a web 3 game to promote the upcoming film remfield featuring Nicholas Cage as Dracula I saw this film I liked this film it was a great summer comedy players can win digital Collectibles within this game minted on the Aptos blockchain by identifying hidden bugs in these stylized photos Aptos Labs is a layer 1 blockchain secured by proof of stake with a market cap of 2.35 billion and Partnerships with Google cloud and moonpay this next project we've never talked about it on the channel before I think it's relatively new I'm bringing it to your attention because Joe Rogan is bullish on this crypto project specifically it's kind of a way to bet on MMA fights but the players also get rewarded I need to dive deeper into this this may be one of the first signs of early adoption of web3 I do know karate combat has an interest in gaming but this is massive for sports too let's highlight it karate combat this is what Joe Rogan has to say on Karate combat it's great so they listen to the fans they get 10 of the fighters and if a lot of people are betting that could be really good for the fighters as well to get a little bit of extra dough I really like the idea of a token that's attached to an organization that makes me excited about crypto tokens because look at this okay all new Karate Combat app is now live so that's a great idea it's a great idea also that it goes to the fighters as well ten percent if the UFC implemented something like that I think that would be very successful I think it's a very very good idea I think so too probably one of the most unique ideas that I've heard in a long time and an implementation of crypto token that I think is fantastic uniswap still the leading decentralized exchange out there making new all-time highs in monthly active users uniswap monthly active users about to hit 1 million eth layer 2 polygon is changing the game in many ways Reddit seems to be one of the only platforms that cracked the code for nft adoption on ethereum are specifically on polygon Reddit the only big Tech firm that cracked the nft code polygon co-founder says polygon co-founder applauds Reddit success and onboarding millions of users to crypto during a wide-ranging discussion this was during an AMA session on Reddit no doubt polygon's co-founder said the social media giant cracked the code for nft adoption besides sharing pro-crypto and polygon views like how web3 will complement web 2 in areas like Finance gaming social media the founder also explained how Reddit managed to win over its Community with the launch of its digital Collectibles the social media platform introduced nfts they didn't call them nfts they called them collectible avatars on polygon July 2022 smack dab in the middle of a bear market via airdrops and early sales of digital Collectibles for up to 100 the early nfts went on to sell for hundreds of dollars on the secondary Market overall Reddit was just able to drive tons of Engagement with Reddit nfts perhaps because nfts went out to specific communities already established subreddits within reddit reddit was responsible for adding 3 million crypto users in the first three months following its nft launch over the last 10 months the company has successfully onboarded 9.7 million users to reddit's nft platform and this is all happening on polygon polygon represents a multi-chain ecosystem of

Here are the cryptocurrencies I‚Äôm buying this month.  The first is Pulsechain.  Ethereum did 14,000X from its lows and Pulsechain has already done more transaction volume than Solana and Avalanche.  And it was even beating Binance Chain at one point last week.  And at more than 14,000X that means one $PLS token will reach over $0.10 if not more.  The second is Hex.  Since the Ethereum Hex and now Hex on Pulsechain have split, it has caused mass confusion and chaos between holders.  Hex still offers trustless yield of 38% APY if you stake for the maximum length.  And I think Hex could rich $1 if not more on both chains in the next bull run.  The third is XRP.  Rumor has it the lawsuit is ending in the next few weeks to month, and I think XRP could pump has high as $5 if not more if they win the lawsuit.  Like and follow for more.

top tokens of the crypto Market are moving sight words but all coins are pumping with multiple mean coins up over one thousand percent in just two weeks and various other low market cap all coins spiking in price this might not be a great time to buy Bitcoin but altcoin prices are still low and it is a really good time to pick up lower market cap all coins before it's too late that's why in today's video we present you five well-established projects which we have been buying this week in the crypto Market rebound we have included a range of low risk to high risk Investments with number five being by far the most lucrative in our opinion so make sure you stay until the end of the video to see what the best crypto to buy right now is also just before we go any further this channel has a daily giveaway of 1 million Sheba tokens to enter all you have to do is be subscribed to this channel like this video and comment hashtag Shiba Inu good luck also guys please beware of scammers in the comments I will never ask you to send me money and I do not have WhatsApp or Telegram and of course this content is not Financial advice anyway let's not waste any more time and get into it now the first token of the video although is not our number one pick I still feel it is an amazing project that you can't miss out on number one hetera currently hedora is priced at around 5 cents with a market cap of just over 1.7 billion dollars what is hetera in simple terms hbar is a digital currency used to power transactions and operations within the hedora hashgraph ecosystem which focuses on offering an alternative to blockchain technology for creating fast secure and scalable decentralized Solutions why do I think hetera's price will explode unlike traditional blockchain platforms hetera hashgraph uses a unique consensus algorithm called hashgraph which aims to provide high throughput low latency and strong security but the main reason that I believe h-bar's price will explode is because it is ISO 222 compliant for those that don't know the iso 222 standard is the new protocol being adopted by the international financial industry due to h-bar's Advanced and patented technology it sticks out in the crypto market and could be one of the best cryptocurrencies for financial services hetera's price targets and predictions hbar has previously hit all-time highs of 56 cents but the crypto had a lower Supply so the market calf didn't need to be as high but now there is a bigger supply the token will need a higher market cap to get to 56 cents but h-bar is a great cryptocurrency and I believe it will get to a 10 billion dollar market cap this would give the crypto a price of 31 cents using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around two thousand dollars in profit if the token was to hit just 31 cents number two Quant ly is priced at around 112 dollars with a market cap of 1.6 billion dollars the token is currently down 73 from its all-time highs what is Quant Quant is a cryptocurrency that powers the Quant Network which focuses on connecting and integrating disparate blockchain networks and traditional systems to facilitate efficient and secure communication and data Exchange why do I think quants price will explode Quant Network aims to address the critical issue of interoperability in the blockchain space enabling seamless communication between different blockchains and Legacy systems which is a much needed functionality for widespread adoption not only this but similar to h-bar Quant is also ISO 222 compliant meaning the chance of major adoption within Financial Services is highly likely quant's price targets and predictions I think it's fair to say Quant could have a similar market cap to hbar so we will say it could reach a market cap of 10 billion dollars this would give the crypto a price of 685 dollars using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around two thousand five hundred fifty dollars in profit if the token was to hit 685 number three Aptos currently Aptos is priced at around 9.59 with a market cap of over 1.8 billion dollars what is Aptos Aptos is a layer one blockchain focused on scalability safety reliability and upgradability as its key principles it is designed to run a variety of decentralized applications and non-fungible tokens and users can be reassured of a secure key recovery system why do I think Aptos price will explode my main reason for believing apto's price will explode is that the project has a strong partnership with Google Aptos also just recently announced another new collaboration with Google which will provide startups with the support and resources needed to develop infrastructure Bridge platforms and Foster the future of web3 Aptos price targets and predictions earlier this year Aptos hit all-time highs of 19.92 but the market cap was only 2.9 billion dollars I could see Aptos hitting a market cap of 15 billion dollars giving it a price of 78 dollars using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around three thousand five hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit just 78 number four injective currently injective is priced at around seven dollars and 48 cents with a market cap of 597 million dollars what is injective injective protocol is a decentralized exchange that offers cross-chain margin trading derivatives and forks Futures Trading the injective protocol is built on the cosmos blockchain as a layer 2 application the protocol uses cross-chain Bridges which allow traders to access cryptocurrencies from platforms such as ethereum and polkadot why do I think injectives price will explode unlike other popular decentralized exchanges such as uniswap or Banker injective protocol does not use an automated Market maker formula to manage liquidity instead injective follows the order book model that has been widely used for years across a centralized stock and crypto exchanges in doing so injective aims to match the efficiency of traditional Finance with the transparency of decentralized exchanges injective has also been making lots of positive developments throughout the bear market and has recently started integrating with multiple other blockchains injective price targets and predictions I believe that injective could reach a 10 billion dollar market cap which would give it a price of 125 dollars using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around seven thousand eight hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit just dollars now time for the final token of today's video this one is currently at a very low market cap valuation and has the potential to make you millions of dollars in profit so drop a like on the video to support me for finding this gem number five wojak currently wajac is priced at around 0.0004 dollars with a market cap of 31 million dollars watch Act is a meme coin and is extra volatile so take Extra Care investing in this project it is also down 17 for today but it could definitely still bounce back soon what is wajac wojak is a mean coin based on the famous internet logic character why do I think wajac's price will explode at the end of the day it is a meme coin and the reasons it could explode are mainly due to buying volume and popularity I believe the people who missed on initially buying into Pepe will buy into wajac and when the token is listed on more exchanges it will sustain more buying volume 's price targets and predictions I believe that if wajac's price pumps it could reach similar market caps to the Pepe coin Pepe hit a market cap high of 585 million dollars if one Jack Hits the same it would have a price of 0.008 dollars using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around eight thousand eight hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit zero point zero zero eight dollars but these aren't the only tokens you should be buying up at the moment if you want to find out the five best AI cryptos to buy now then check out the video on screen now trust me you don't want to miss out on these 100x potential coins

Will the best cryptos to buy now blow up?  Will the top cryptos to buy now include Ethereum?  Will the best metaverse cryptos to buy now include Mana?  This is a good look at the Sandbox price, Shiba Inu price, Dogecoin price, and Ethereum price compared to the Bitcoin price as well as some of the other best altcoins to buy now.  Will Shiba Inu come back to crush it or is it old news?  Will Dogecoin stop Shiba from that?  I go over three of the biggest market cap Metaverse cryptos out there.  The first is one that I own already, which is the Decentraland Mana crypto.  I am excited to see it rising from where I bought it already.  The Mana price prediction is under pressure, but could bounce back after the halving of Bitcoin.   The next of the best Metaverse cryptos to buy now is the Sandlot token SAND.  I can see SAND price prediction doubling as well from the current price over the next few months as more attention is paid towards this space.  We will see if the SAND token can grow from its current market cap up to where I believe it should be...about 3-4 times current price.  The metaverse crypto to buy now.  Top metaverse crypto to buy now is out there.  The Mana price prediction is big and so is the Sand price prediciton.  The Sandbox token is one not to sleep on.  I can see these metaverse cryptos blowing up over the next few years.    üí†Stock Moe's Patreon  https://www.patreon.com/stockmoe Stock Moe Discord is included with a Stock Moe Patreon Tiered Pledge.

back this has to be one of the best asset classes out there that I like and yes the equities Market is sleeping right now it's just kind of enjoying the weekend but you know what never sleeps crypto it's always running it's always doing something sometimes it's a trip and fall but it has gotten up every single time will this be the same thing or are we in the the crypto winner that has years and years to go we'll go over that as well as we'll take a look at some of the price predictions for some of these coins out there and tell you where it's going to go but right now this is my best crypto to buy now the list of course we'll go over the ethereum price prediction the Bitcoin price prediction I've done some videos on it but it's been a while now before we get into it of course make sure you take advantage of the MooMoo link down below put 100 in using my link you get 10 free stocks worth up to 2 000 a piece then of course if you go over to the Weeble link down below any deposit a dollar or more and you will get up to 12 stocks worth up to thirty thousand six under and friends I am going to be buying stocks and of course crypto if you'd like to join us along with that all you got to do is come on over to the patreon link down below sign up you can join up you can see all the different posts everything else we got going on there and of course follow along with the buy sells and be a part of that Discord that's what it's about now we gotta talk about this where is crypto been where are we gone is it over is the winner over of course I thought we already had the low for ethereum was it I've said this before I thought the crypto winner was over for ethereum when we hit that 800 and something that to me was the ultimate low and from there on out we will not get back down below the 800 now I could be wrong maybe a major recession out there could cause something like that but I don't think it will be the major oh my it's a repeat of the Great Recession of 2008 I don't think we're there I do think we'll see some pain and that includes any riskier asset classes such as Crypt though but is there room for crypto to explode over the next two to three years I think the answer to that is yes so much so that I've been putting a lot of money into ethereum building up my position have it staked enjoying the returns and we'll see where it goes but the first we got to go when we're talking about the best cryptos to buy now you can't you got the big dog on the porch it has yet to be dethroned how can you come out here and say well why are you adding Bitcoin listen bitcoin's the big dog he's up there he doesn't have to howl they howl at him all right here we got uh 27 000 right now over the last week of 0.55 so this is kind of the and we're going to look at the week and the month for each one of these down 4.16 for the month for the week up 0.55 percent less than the s p the s p was up more than this so I think it was like 1.8 or nine so we look at Bitcoin and I still think the energy usage is gonna come back to bite this thing in the in the butt someday and we could could see a change down the road like we did with ethereum I definitely think that so 0.55 so we'll just throw it out there you guys know I I'm not into Bitcoin I am into this this ethereum is my favorite when we look at the cryptos the best cryptos to buy now to me there is no other that beats this one could you make a little bit more with some of the others maybe but you're rolling the dice and I think the odds are against you picking the right one personally I think ethereum is where it's at others would say that bitcoin's where it's at my ethereum price prediction I think will hit 10 000 sometime before the end of 2025 doesn't mean we're gonna but if things add up right we're not in a recession we're out of that the feds are cutting rates aggressively put all that together after the having of Bitcoin it usually starts in this next Bull cycle so I would argue with the ethereum being deflationary that we could get to the point that we see this thing close to 20 000 during the next top off of the bull cycle I actually think it could get above there but we'll see because a lot of people are disagreeing but you can see over the last week point nine percent did beat Bitcoin over the last month down six percent did not beat Bitcoin so we're seeing a good week last week but we'll see how it goes going further you guys know this is it that's where I'm putting most of my money I do have some other smaller positions and then we'll start into that the next of the best cryptos to buy now in my portfolio I have cardano in there uh I like the I like cardani you can see over the last week point three one up let's just follow along with ethereum and Bitcoin over the last month down 8.64 so crypto's been struggling last month you see that through Bitcoin you see it through ethereum you see it through Ada I like this for a D5 play that's where a lot of this I would say value could come from as it I always think of some of the old banking services as dinosaurs and crypto is going to be able to do that lightning quick and at a fraction of the cost and so we'll see if that plays out over the next 10 to 20 years but if you're just buying this for a day or two and probably skip this video and this I'm talking about long term I'm talking about possibilities down the road these are the ones I like the next of the best cryptos to buy now Solana over the last week under pressure down 3.17 percent and over the last months a lot of down 8.59 for the month not too bad it's just like the other ones you're seeing them on in the single digits down but I think there's potential I think there's potential like I said we got we got these issue and when I say potential I'm not saying the next week or two because for anybody following my channel and I got a lot more to go over here but for those five on my Channel I want to make make this perfectly clear I believe a recession is coming and it's a haircut to the entire economy including crypto I think crypto could see a hit as we go through this recession but I also believe that crypto is going to be the first to rebound out of that recession that crypto is going to give us the biggest bang for the buck once we get out and I think it's going to happen before we're out of the recession that will start to get that ounce back how bad of a drop I'm not sure it'll probably be very correlated to the overall markets and so if the markets are down 10 I think crypto drops 10 maybe a little bit more usually does go a little bit more down or up but there is last time I was looking it was between 30 and 40 correlation between equities and crypto so we'll find out next of the best cryptos to buy now this is what I want to buy and Avalanche I'm watching I got it on my radar over the last week down 2.14 down 20 percent thankfully I didn't buy it but I still like it and we're gonna I'm keeping an eye on it is this one it's going to pan out I'm not sure I don't have it but we will look and be loading up on this as we go forward not sure we'll see how it goes now uh Mana decentraland the next of the best cryptos to buy now and these are the best this is my best met of cryptos to buy now the metaverse cryptos to buy now I only have two on the list basically it's man and the next one of course over the last week man I got a a lot of love 8.68 might be the biggest I don't remember uh down 17.06 over the last month that tells you even with the eight eight percent up last week that's how bad thing this got hit beforehand you can see I had a little pop up and I was coming back down it's partner in crime here sandbox and this is the other best cryptos to buy now for the metaverse and you can see 5.23 is this the best investment to have is it not the metaverse was getting a lot of love from meta AKA Facebook but now they're cutting back looking into AI instead everybody's following the Hot Topics out there when metaverse was it everybody was jumping in now it's AI so we look at this down uh you can see down 13.98 good week last week but over the last month not so much then we move into the retail Place Dogecoin down are up 2.46 over the last week actually doing well down 12.24 so this last month has been brutal for crypto why do I bring this to your attention because it's all crypto take a look at Shiba Inu the shiba inu you can see down point one three percent for the month down 17.46 so everything's been getting absolutely slaughtered over the last four weeks last week was a little bit of a reprieve but we saw that in the equities too is this temporary or is there are we going to see a continuation of this pop-up and lastly Matic we're talking polygon I like this one as well have this in a portfolio last week 2.66 percent over the last month 16.23 we'll show a year for this one of 34.48 through all that madness out there so these are the cryptos I've been watching I got to tell you something I I look at Bitcoin people say do you think it can go up to a hundred thousand your bitcoin price prediction yeah I think I think Bitcoin will eventually break through hit that hundred thousand dollar Mark but here's the thing that puts it up around four times where it's at now I think ethereum gets up over 10 000 which would be about five to six times its current value and I do believe over the next five years I think ethereum will overtake Bitcoin in market cap and be the largest crypto out there in terms of market cap now some of the things we've been waiting on with ethereum as we're waiting for the SEC to go ahead and I'll allow us to put this thing out there in ETF form and we're talking about the physical backing of these Bitcoin and ethereum but right now you're seeing a lot of offerings being pulled I don't know what's going on is a commodity is it security that's the argument that everybody's waiting here from The Regulators of where we're going it's going to play into at the end of the day crypto's not going away after what happened with FTX and some other some other companies out there the platforms we knew that massive regulation was coming because when the when the hedge funds in the the billionaires start to get hit that's when they get their friends down in DC involved and now they're involved and so now we got to sit back and wait see where it goes but post that time frame with the positive things I've talked about especially for ethereum like I said the deflationary pressures you got once uh we get through the having we got some the sharding that'll that's always a good word to use but once we get that all involved we can get up to 100 000 transactions per second that is in saying how quickly this could go for ethereum this is big stuff so we'll keep an eye on all that and I think the the potential for massive growth for this is big and then from there we got to watch some of these all so some of these alts will probably outperform both Bitcoin and ethereum but at the end of the day it doesn't mean that I'm going to be like Oh I'm going to chase it right now I'm going with the big dogs I should say big dog ethereum I don't got the Bitcoin I think ethereum is worth zapher I'm taking a chance I got 97 percent of my money in ethereum for those that don't know I have well over a hundred ethereum trying to get up to 200 and then I kind of want to sit back and watch I'll probably continue to buy a little bit weekly with my DCA but that's where I'm at right now for those who

with AI cryptocurrencies taking over of course AI cryptocurrencies pumped earlier on in the year but most of these projects have now had some price correction and it is an amazing time to buy while prices are low that's why in today's video we present you five well-established AI crypto projects that I have been buying this week we have included a range of different AI crypto that all have the potential to 100x from their current value number five is by far the biggest investment opportunity of the year so make sure you watch until the end of the video to find out what the best crypto to buy right now is also just before we go any further this channel has a daily giveaway of 1 million Shiba tokens to enter all you have to do is be subscribed to this channel like this video and comment hashtag Shiba Inu good luck also guys please beware of scammers in the comments I will never ask you to send me money and I do not have WhatsApp or Telegram and of course this content is not Financial advice anyway let's not waste any more time and get into it now the first token of the video although it is not our number five pick I still feel it is an amazing project that you can't miss out on number one singularitynet currently Singularity net is priced at around 28 cents with a market cap of over 343 million dollars what is singularitynet it is a decentralized Marketplace for AI the business value of AI is becoming clearer each day with things like chat GPT blowing up in businesses throwing literally hundreds of billions into building the next big AI it's clear there is a ton of money to be made however there is a significant gap between the people developing AI tools and the businesses that want to use them Singularity net wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with each other if you look into the background of the project it has an amazing team of over 50 AI developers and with AI being the hyped thing in 2023 I think we could see Singularity becoming worth multiple billions I think a big but also Fair prediction is that the token could reach 5 billion dollars in market cap this would give the token a value of four dollars and 20 cents using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you can make around seven thousand dollars in profit if the token was to hit four dollars twenty cents number two ocean protocol currently ocean is priced at around 33 cents with a market cap of over 144 million dollars ocean is currently down 82 percent from its all-time high of 1.90 what is ocean protocol the ocean protocol is an ecosystem composed of data assets and services where assets are represented by data and algorithms and services are represented by integration processing and persistence mechanisms ocean protocol facilitates Discovery by storing and promoting metadata linking assets and services and provides a licensing framework that has tool sets for pricing I believe ocean could hit a price target of at least three dollars in the right market conditions using the crypto profit calculator from just a five hundred dollar investment at the current price you can make around four thousand dollars in profit if the token was to hit just three dollars number three or I chain currently aurai is priced at around three dollars and 64 cents with a market cap of just 18 million dollars what is Ori Ori chain is a cryptocurrency that powers the origin Network the RHA network is an AI powered Oracle and blockchain ecosystem oracles are systems that feed real world data into blockchains and origin uses AI to provide accurate and secure real-world data for smart contracts on the blockchain the Ori token is used for various purposes within the origin Network including staking governance and pain for services Ori is a great token that could go really high in the right market conditions I think orai could reach a market cap of 250 million dollars giving it a price of around 48.70 using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you can make around three thousand four hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit 48.70 now everyone we are getting into the really strong buys these next two projects have very low market caps and both have the potential to make you a lot of money in the next couple of months number four anus Network currently EOS is priced at around one cent with a market cap of over 17 million dollars what is AOS network is a blockchain based content delivery Network CDN the project aims to create a decentralized platform for streaming audio and video content by leveraging blockchain technology ao's Network intends to reduce the cost of content delivery improve speed and provide a more efficient and user-friendly streaming experience as token is used within the network for various purposes such as rewarding content creators and users and for governance decisions within the as ecosystem EOS is a cool project that offers something different to web3 I think in the right market conditions we could see as hit a market cap of 1 billion dollars this would give the token a price of one dollar and four cents using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around twenty eight thousand three hundred dollars in profit if the token was to hit 47 cents now time for the final token of today's video this one is currently at an under 1 million dollar market cap valuation and has the potential to make you millions of dollars in profit so drop a like on the video to support me for finding this gem number five AI write currently AI write is priced at around 0.003 dollars with a market cap of around 888 thousand dollars what is AI right AI write is a cryptocurrency used within the AI right ecosystem which is the world's first complete system for AI nfts and defy users in this system can generate AI nfts protect origin with copyright issuance trade and tokenize unique artworks and benefit from a complete royalty mechanism for contributors on chain origin the ecosystem provider of AI write secures AI functionalities via AI Oracle access is the marketplace organizes galleries for defy and enables cross-chain bridging for nfts the big thing that makes AI write different from other nft marketplaces is that it has AI content authenticity mechanisms to stop copyright infringements one of the biggest issues in nfts is fraud and plagiarism AI right solves this now a really big reason why I think this project could reach insanely high valuations is that it has patented technology this means they completely own the rights to this technology and no other project or business can copy them AI write has the potential to soar to multi-billion dollar market caps in the long run but you are so early that if this project reaches even a 100 million dollar market cap then you could get yourself a 100x for this video we will say that it could hit a 150 million dollar market cap but I do think in the long run it could reach way higher if it hits a 150 million dollar market cap then it would give the token a value of 50 cents using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could make around 82 000 in profit if the token was to hit 50 cents but these aren't the only tokens you should be buying up at the moment if you want to find out the top 5 best cryptos to buy now then check out the video on screen now trust me you don't want to miss out on these 100x potential coins

what I'm about to explain now this isn't some charge or technical analysis or whatever you see online this is something that's much much bigger so please I urge you watch this whole video through because I promise you whatever game plan strategy that you guys have right now it'll change after knowing this now this video is going to be a little different from what I usually post instead of just mentioning the coins that you guys should buy which I still will be towards the end of the video I'm first going to mention what's happening in the markets right now because this will ultimately help you even more but before we get into it I just want to quickly mention for those of you that don't know I actually have a newsletter where I send out Daily Business trends that haven't hit the market and how you can be the first to it and make money off of it it's completely free and if you guys want you can sign up by clicking the link down below and as always make sure you guys smash that like button subscribe if you guys haven't already for all your crypto updates and without further Ado let's get into it alright so the stuff I'm going to share with you guys I'm going to be honest I'd even find out for myself until recently so I'm gonna try breaking this down as simple as possible for you so if we look at the price of Bitcoin the all-time high we hit was about 64-65 000 and right now we're sitting at around 16 000. now judging by what everyone else is saying on Twitter and all these other videos I'm pretty sure you're thinking that we're at the bottom and we can't go any lower for bitcoin's price I mean you can tell that just by looking at the chart or just seeing everything that's happened recently with FTX black five Voyager Luna all these liquidations heck even if you were to look at a technical point of view everything indicates that we're at the bottom so realistically we can't go any lower and that's what a lot of people already think I mean even with one of the largest lenders Genesis going under the market barely even moved three percent if if this was any other time period we would have easily saw a 10 to 20 drop but we didn't so in order for us to see the price come down lower substantially we're gonna need to see some crazy stuff happen like like Finance going under or uh usdt getting pulled or something of that nature something large has to happen for the price to come down further than it was already at so like I said everything is pointing out for the market to be at the bottom already and everyone kind of already figures that and if it wasn't for what I'm about to share with you I honestly would be buying all this up in dollar cost averaging in but there's something really big happening that a lot of people are overlooking and I was too onto I watched another video and realized just how big this actually is now to understand this we're gonna need to zoom out instead of just looking at the crypto markets we have to look at the traditional markets as well so stocks equities bonds real estate because everything is all tied together now whether you like it or not now I'm going to explain it just as it was explaining the video because it did a really good job getting the point across so basically think of a big skyscraper and within that skyscraper we have all the markets that I mentioned so stocks bonds Equity Real Estate everything is within the skyscraper and then in the basement all the way at the bottom of the skyscraper we have our little itty bitty crypto market so in our tiny Market in the basement everyone is partying having a good time thinking crypto has finally bottomed out and things are only going to go up from here but what they don't understand is that we have all these other big markets right on top of us so when all these markets end up crashing down what do you think will happen to the price of crypto now we don't know how low we can go but the point is there is a huge possibility of this happening and it could send prices crashing and the reason I know this can happen is because of what I'm about to tell you now what people need to understand is yes we're in a crypto bear Market but this is the first time that we're in a macro bear Market as well meaning all the other Investments are down as well because previously in history every time crypto would be in these beer markets um 2013 2017 2022 these other markets were perfectly fine if anything they were thriving so even though at the time of those crypto bear markets large investors or whales that were in crypto and that saw other portfolios getting crushed they were perfectly fine with it because all their other Investments were doing well now imagine all these other Investments they have which probably make up like 90 of their net worth crash as well what do you think they're gonna do with their crypto we're talking about something that's never happened in history but for people would even know how to react and this is also one of the main reasons why people don't do well in crypto and I was the same way as well you think crypto is its own thing and it was at one point but now there's just so much tied into the crypto market and the one who understands this will end up making a killing also another thing I wanted to mention is this chart now this is the Bitcoin rainbow chart and it shows where we are in the market every time we were in the bear Market it predicted it and it showed the rally afterwards as well now I've seen a lot of people refer to this chart and I myself have used it as well as it's a very popular chart so if you use it I encourage you to stop because everything about it is wrong because amongst the whole chart we've never seen one bad macro environment meaning all the other investments in the world are crashing There's real estate crashing credit debt is skyrocketing layoffs are everywhere home prices are skyrocketing retirement is plummeting we didn't see any of that during this chart so this is a good chart for you know when everything is going well in the world when there's no worries no tension when every other investment is doing great but overall this chart legit doesn't even make sense to use then I'm embarrassed that I've used it before myself because just imagine how this chart will look when every other Market is falling on top of crypto and people have insanely High credit down on top of that they're not being able to afford their house their retirement money is pretty much crashing that that would be insane now if we look at the top of Bitcoin again the reason why we saw such a huge drop in its price from 65 000 was because in November that's when inflation was really starting to pick up and there were talks that the Fed was going to start to raise interest rates and what happens when interest rates increase normal finance and everything else crashes now how does not have this inflation problem that we had back in November would we have past 65 000 I really think we would have because there was nothing stopping us at the time so everyone who was buying up here at 65 000 were only focused on the crypto market and weren't taking into account the macro lens and seeing that their rate hikes were coming and because of that they ended up getting crushed so if we look at the bottom of crypto right now which everyone thinks we are in they aren't taking into account that everything else in the skyscraper is going to fall right on top top of us and bring down the price even more now if we look at one more thing this is a chart that shows what happened every time the FED started to raise interest rates and we can see from this chart that when the FED begins to Pivot we can see an even more drop in the market value and what you have to understand is the second interest rates increase the market doesn't just come down right away it can take months to years before we see the outcomes of a rate increase because what will happen is businesses will start to lay off people people will start to spend less money the stock price will start to come down the real estate prices will start to come down and all this is what brings down the market overall and all this takes time to happen and that's what we're seeing happen right now with tech stocks getting hit like crazy layoffs starting to occur in mortgage demand dropping these these are all side effects of increased interest rates so what do I think is going to happen well I honestly feel like the general Finance market so stocks uh equities bonds is most likely going to crash there's just so much going on right now we saw 10 years of legit perfectness and now we're finally starting to see the side effects start to roll in so what does this mean well the price of Bitcoin right now is was about sixteen thousand and this is with all the other markets you know just being average and nothing crazy happening to it but when we start to see the effects of everything and traditional markets start to crash I honestly think Bitcoin will go lower than 16 000. how low will Bitcoin go I honestly have no clue but what I do know is that there is no way that Bitcoin will stay stagnant while all the other markets are crashing that's just impossible and won't happen now there is a slight possibility that we avert all of this and the traditional markets don't take that big of a hit and we don't see the markets crash but that's something we just can't predict so that brings us to the question what can we do well we have two outcomes all the markets could crash bringing crypto down with it as well or we could hit a soft bottom and we don't see any crazy crash and we just start picking up straight from there so let's say the markets crash hypothetically if we look back at the chart we can see that every time the FED pivots we see the price always recover eventually so if you buy any time during this time frame you're good now you don't need to time it perfectly but just buy Within These time frames and the thing is you can honestly buy anything and you'll be good because there'll be so much blood in the markets that anything you buy will legit be a good investment that will pay off eventually and you can even just buy the top cryptos and you'll still see some crazy gains I'm talking ethereum cardano BNB Ripple but we aren't in that time period not right now so the best course of action right now is to hold off and see what is going to happen with these markets now I know a lot of you guys just love to dollar cost average so if you guys want to continue that go for it but just have enough on the sidelines where if this does happen your fuel is ready to go and if by some miracle we don't see these crashes and we see a massive Boron instead which which is slightly possible then you just go straight into all coins and you just ride the wave up because remember first bitcoin's price will go up and then the all coins price will follow after so once we start to see Bitcoin go then you can start getting into these smaller all coins and make more money that way now crypto has definitely gotten it the worst with all these liquidations and everything else going on in the markets but these other traditional markets are holding pretty well but soon that won't be the case and we're gonna start to see more layoffs start coming in debts start increasing people start to spending less money which was going to cause stocks to plummet as well which will bring down the crypto prices as well but yeah this is the big picture that's happening in the market right now and it's honestly a huge thing that I don't see anyone talking about now yes crypto is down right now and everyone is saying that it is the bottom because it looks just like every other bottom we had but you have to remember those bottoms happen when the traditional markets were doing just fine crypto just went down on its own but now we have the chance of this huge skyscraper falling right on top of us but yeah that's all I have for you guys hopefully this opened your eyes to actually what's happening in the markets right now I know this video was a little different from what I usually post but this really needed to be said and if you guys have any insights make sure you guys let me know down in the comment section below also I know a lot of you guys are into trading or want to start trading so I highly suggest you guys looking into Lux I'll go now I talk about them all the time and I just love promoting them because they've helped me so much but it's an algorithm that tells you exactly when to buy and sell stocks crypto and Forex I've been using it for over two years now and it's honestly a game changer for me they have so many special indicators you can use as well to help make better trades and like I said I've talked about them plenty of times in previous videos but if you guys want solid signals that are actually correct and tell you when to buy and sell you guys can check out Lux I'll go about kicking the link down below but I hope you guys have a great rest of your day and I'll see you guys in next week's video peace

exploded onto the scene everybody's talking Ai and no I'm not talking about Allen Iverson after all this isn't just practice we're talking about practice man but the fact is is that Chad gbt is ushered in a new level of interest for this technology now everybody's asking the question will AI replace all human jobs or even more Sinister replace humans let's get it welcome to bitwood crypto my name has been make sure to smash that like button or have your AI do it for you also don't forget to subscribe to the channel makes you a member of the bid Squad alright guys let's talk AI in 2004 the Blockbuster film iRobot bust onto the scene and made waves and really caused a lot of people to think about the future of robots in Ai and by AI of course we mean artificial intelligence as we move forward in entertainment and movie business we saw films like dudesmashina and shows like black mirror that demonstrate the pros and the cons of this powerful technology some of it has quite the dark side and of course in November of last year now almost everyone has gotten a chance to be exposed to AI in the form of chat GPT it's absolutely exploded in popularity growing faster than any other social media in history even though it's not technically a social media site but you get the point and now there is money everywhere pouring into this industry and as the crypto markets have turned around a plethora AI projects have popped up or some refreshed in order to take advantage of this hype and craze so in this video we're going to be highlighting our top three AI coins in crypto they're taking advantage of the hype but also have the substance to back it up the first project we got my eye on is fetch AI a project I've actually known about for quite some time it's been hard to ignore lately as it's pumped 200 since the new year of course almost all AI projects have been pumping but this one in particular has been moving and it's the number three overall market cap coin in the AI Niche and in zero to 100 real quick it went from 30 cents to well over a buck now the coin is called fat f-e-t and it's utility of fetch so let's look at what it does the gist of fetches combining AI with blockchain to build a decentralized inclusive digital economy it will enable people to be able to trade goods and services in the most optimal way on their Twitter bio it says they're building the autonomy of things they do this through their interchange Bridge which autonomous agents and their open economic framework Now The Interchange Bridge is a key feature of fetch AI because it allows interoperability that's what Bridges do connects now this is D5 so things work very interesting here what this project does is it combines all of the strengths of certain blockchains and gets rid of some of the weaknesses of other blockchains to create a monster AI transaction the bridge allows it to move fluidly through all the chains imagine a transaction with the security of Bitcoin the privacy of zcash the speed of hbar and this is all possible with fetch AI now these autonomous agents they're not like agent Smith they're peer-to-peer computer programs so I guess maybe you could say they kind of are they make decisions based off data that they're given fetch AI gives these agents the ability to interact with each other and negotiate and solve real world problems of course these agents are self-governed they don't need humans watching over them they use Ai and machine learning to collect and analyze data then they make improvements think about how this is going to work in robotics computer networks or self-driving cars the autonomous agents and The Interchange Bridge what really packed the punch in this project what allows them to get things done of course their end goal well that's to create an open decentralized Digital Economy based on their open economic framework or their oef it's actually the most crucial piece to this puzzle kind of like the corner the oef is an open source platform that integrates smart contracts AI endows to automate and optimize trading into Quick secure transparent way it leverages all the other pieces of the puzzle to make this economy work as a star this month fetch well the heated Milestone five million transactions on their main net all in all fetch AI well it's a very impressive project it's got a lot of substance behind it now it's already pumped huge will it continue certainly you can have a retracement but when it does it might be a good one to take a position in but just remember right now ai is the trend we've seen it with metaverse and FTS supply chain tons of other niches so remember the hype always does die down in crypto the next one we're going to cover Singularity net AKA AG IX that was a lot of letters in a row right now it's ranked number two in market cap and all AI projects it's already pumped over 900 since the beginning of this year and there's a reason for it built on ethereum Singularity net is a Marketplace for AI Services the AGI Network what breaks barriers down and allows people to offer these AI services and for users to be able to access them their ticker agix it stands for artificial general intelligence exchange and the developers who contribute these Services well they're paid in agix the singularity net Dow well it allows users to vote on which AI projects to fund next also the services from The Exchange their used upon those projects as well powered by Cosmos is sdks it's a perfect place to access AI technology on a decentralized platform and just by scrolling the services on their marketplace now in the demo you'll see how impressive the list is these Services include multilingual speech translator to allow any human to talk to any human image generation textual emotion recognition which gives real emotion to monotone text in my favorite neural music demixing where you can separate the drums vocals bass Etc into separate files you can choose to have just the drums or just remove the vocals so you can freestyle over your favorite hip-hop beat that's what I do definitely go scroll their Marketplace is going to be huge competition for chat GPT Singularity net while they're also behind hits and Robotics who've built Sofia the robot who's very lifelike also don't forget about her sister Desi Desdemona that's right I met her and we kind of had a thing what I like most about Singularity net is that it's making AI accessible everyday people can now use these and developers who didn't really know how to offer their services well now they've got a channel to do that Ben gurtzel and his team are years ahead of everybody else in this game and Ben gergel in my opinion I've met him talked to him consider him a loose friend only met him a few times but we along very well and I'll tell you this smartest guy I ever met nothing about this chat gbt they averaged 13 million users a day think about the unbelievable amount of people that Singularity net and agix has to draw from that's why I think even though it's about 900 percent can certainly waiver retracement it's got bigger and better things in this bull run ahead third project we're looking at is Althea AI it's been the idea of a metaverse and a time machine and sent it Forward 100 years their Twitter bio states that they're building at the intersection of generative Ai and blockchain and it's not at all an exaggeration the end game for this project is to build an intelligent metaverse where intelligent nfts or infps are on the same infs are built on character GPT AI it's a protocol that would be similar to chat GPT so the difference is you can actually talk learn and interact with it it's launch it on polygon and then a single prompt users will be able to create any character any voice any look they want and also their personality and their skill sets and once you have your character you can tokenize it also don't forget to customize and train it once you do that you'll be able to trade its generative outputs across other dapps and protocols although they're intelligent metaverse well they're calling it Noah's Ark and it's still being built but you can already create and interact with your own custom AI Avatar you can do that at micro character.ai well Noah's Ark well to be here in no time maybe 40 days and 40 nights Mark Cuban actually called this one back in 2021 but he also called iron Finance Valley Quinn itself well that stands for artificial liquid intelligence and it's without a doubt one to watch between February 3rd and February 6th this year it pumped over 300 percent just like the other ones wait for a pullback do not sleep on this one or I'll create an AI custom avatar that has a special skill set of not sleeping now obviously another one that's been blowing up is the graph so we're not covering in this video we've covered it before we're going to do a deeper dive into the graph in a future video but I want to know what are your thoughts and opinions on those three coins drop them down below that's all I got be blessed way out [Music] thank you [Music]

The crypto market has started rebounding and it looks like we could be entering into this year's bull run, either way, prices are still low and it is a really good time to pick up lower market cap altcoins before it's too late. That‚Äôs why in today‚Äôs video we present you with 5 well-established projects which we have been buying this week in the crypto market rebound, we have included a range of low-risk to high-risk investments, with number 5 being by far the most lucrative in our opinion, so make sure you stay until the end of the video to see what the best crypto to buy right now is. Also just before we go any further this channel has a daily giveaway of 1,000,000 shiba tokens, To enter all you have to do is be subscribed to this channel, like this video, and comment #shiba inu, good luck. Also guys please beware of scammers in the comments, I will never ask you to send me money and I do not have Whatsapp or Telegram, and of course, this content is not financial advice. Anyway, let‚Äôs not waste any more time and get into it. Before we get to the first token I do want to just say that these are mid to long-term buys so don‚Äôt get expect to buy these tokens and to see Lambo‚Äôs within 24 hours, be ready to hold these tokens for at least 12 months and make sure to aggressively take profits when you can. I also just want to mention that I think dollar cost averaging is a good strategy for all of these tokens. Now the first token of the video, although it is not our number one pick I still feel it is an amazing project that you can‚Äôt miss out on. Number 1, Woo Network. Currently, Woo is priced at around 23 cents with a market cap of just over 393 million dollars. What is Woo? Woo Network is a network that helps traders, exchanges, institutions, and Defi platforms connect with each other easily. They can easily trade and get access to the best deals at lower or no cost. The network uses a token called Woo Token that helps users with lower fees and also allows them to earn rewards by holding it. Why do I think Woo‚Äôs price will explode? The woo trading platform is very good and it is used by many traders, the platform has proved its reserves and it also has a 24-hour trading volume of around 68 million dollars. I feel like woo is massively underpriced and that the token should be much closer to a 2 billion dollar market cap, it currently has a market cap of 390 million dollars and a fully diluted value of just over 500 million dollars Using basic mathematical calculations, if Woo were to reach a 2 billion dollar market cap it would give the token a price of 1 dollar and 20 cents. Using the crypto profit calculator, from just a 500-dollar investment at the current price you could make around 2000 dollars in profit if the token was to hit just 1 dollar and 20 cents. Number 2, Frax Share. Currently, Frax Share is priced at around 9 dollars and 17 cents, with a market cap of 681 million dollars, the token is currently down 78% from its all-time highs. What is Frax Share? But first, we need to tell you what Frax is, The Frax Protocol introduced the world to the concept of a cryptocurrency being partially backed by collateral and partially stabilized algorithmically. With the vision to create highly scalable, decentralized money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like Bitcoin. Frax Share is the governance token of the entire Frax ecosystem of smart contracts which accrues fees, revenue, and excess collateral value. Make sure not to mix up Frax Share with their stablecoin called frax. Frax could become a major player in the crypto space and I think the token‚Äôs price could hit 40 to 60 dollars this year. Using the crypto profit calculator, from just a 500-dollar investment at the current price you could make around 2700 dollars in profit if the token was to hit 60 dollars. Number 3, Nervos Network. Currently, Nervos Network is priced at around 0.004 cents, with a market cap of over 156 million dollars. What is Nervos? Nervos is a layered crypto economy network. Nervos separates the infrastructure of a crypto economy into two layers, a verification layer known as layer 1 which serves as a trust root and smart custodian, and a generation layer known as layer 2 for high-performance transactions and privacy protection. Why do I think Nervos price will explode? Nervos Network is one of the more well-known crypto projects, aiming to facilitate flexibility in the world of crypto. The project‚Äôs team has far-reaching plans, which give the crypto investors a lot of faith in the CKB crypto, it has a good community and a great team behind the project. In the right market conditions, I could see CKB hitting above its previous all-time highs and going to a price of 5 cents. Using the crypto profit calculator, from just a 500-dollar investment at the current price you could make around 4800 dollars in profit if the token was to hit just 5 cents. Number 4, Illuvium. Currently, Iluvium is priced at around 76 dollars and 37 cents, with a market cap of over 180 million dollars. Illuvium is currently down 96% from its all-time high of 1911 dollars. What is Illuvium? Illuvium is a decentralized gaming studio that merges online gaming with cryptocurrency. They create uniquely functional, evolving, and high-production-value NFTs that are playable in a universe of play-to-earn gaming titles. Illuvium, their first game in development, is positioned to be the first blockchain-based triple A gaming title offering high-fidelity graphics and addictive gameplay. Their decentralized NFT collection and auto battler game is built on the Ethereum network and integrated with the hyper-scalable ImmutableX layer-two solution. ImmutableX gives the players of Illuvium access to zero gas fees for minting or exchanging assets, as well as sub-second transaction times, all with user-maintained custody. Illuvium‚Äôs game is looking really good and when it officially releases I could see Illuvium going parabolic back up to 1500 dollars. Using the crypto profit calculator, from just a 500-dollar investment at the current price you could make around 9,300 dollars in profit if the token was to hit 1500 dollars. Now time for the final token of today‚Äôs video, this one is currently at a very low market cap valuation and has the potential to make you millions of dollars in profit, so drop a like on the video to support me for finding this gem. Number 5, Insure Defi. Currently, Insure Defi is priced at around 0.003 dollars, the token currently doesn‚Äôt have a market cap or a fully diluted valuation. What is Sure? Insure Defi is a community-based crypto asset insurance ecosystem, where users can insure their crypto portfolio by buying Sure tokens with fiat and other cryptocurrencies. Insure is designed to distribute crypto ownership risks amongst a liquidity pool, with insurance premiums determined by a dynamic pricing model. Sure is currently the 2nd highest-valued insurance cryptocurrency, the entire crypto insurance market currently has a market cap of 560 million dollars, I could see this industry being worth multiple billions and Insure defi being one of the main players in the industry. In the right market conditions, I think insure could hit a price of 12 cents. Using the crypto profit calculator, from just a 500-dollar investment at the current price you could make around 16,800 dollars in profit if the token was to hit just 12 cents. But these aren‚Äôt the only tokens you should be buying up at the moment, if you want to find out the 5 best AI cryptos to buy now then check out the video on screen now, trust me you don‚Äôt want to miss out on these 100x potential coins."

sold ethereum near the top¬† of the following bull cycle when ethereum was four¬†¬† thousand seven hundred dollars you'd have made¬† five thousand seven hundred percent gains meaning¬†¬† if you would have invested one thousand dollars¬† into ethereum at the bottom you could have cashed¬†¬† out that ethereum and made sixty thousand dollars¬† at the Top If you want to make money in crypto do¬†¬† two things right now number one follow our channel¬† for daily crypto coverage and two thumbs up this¬†¬† video now obviously it's near impossible to buy¬† the exact bottom and then sell the exact top what¬†¬† is possible is recognizing an altcoin opportunity¬† near the lows understanding the risk reward ratio¬†¬† buying holding and then selling into strength as¬† you're seeing 1 1000 gains three thousand gains¬†¬† maybe even 5 000 gains and maybe you don't make¬† sixty thousand dollars but with fifty thousand¬†¬† dollars be enough would thirty thousand dollars¬† be enough how would even ten thousand dollars¬†¬† change your life this year many believe that¬† the worst part of the bear Market is now over¬†¬† not only because crypto is eighty percent ninety¬† percent corrected since all-time Highs but also¬†¬† with the collapse of big players like three error¬† Capital Celsius block five and of course the FTX¬†¬† insolvency deleveraging fraud collapse marking¬† the market bottom although I think it is likely¬†¬† that we'll probably see a lot of consolidation and¬† chopping around in the short term in the midterm¬†¬† many believe that there's a major bull market on¬† the horizon it is possible to get rich and change¬†¬† your life in crypto again you must understand the¬† risk versus rewards never invest more than you can¬†¬† afford to lose in videos on this channel just¬† like this one never Financial advice make your¬†¬† own decisions do your own research in today's¬† video I want to highlight why Solana might go¬†¬† on to see five thousand percent gains just like¬† ethereum when ethereum was just 80 in the bear¬†¬† Market of last cycle we need to answer some very¬† important questions regarding Solana and its place¬†¬† in the cryptocurrency market in 2023 and Beyond¬† but before we get to that let's answer the most¬†¬† basic question what is Solana and what makes it¬† special Solana is a platform that seeks to provide¬†¬† a foundation for decentralized applications or¬† adapts in a way that prioritizes scalability in¬†¬† this aim Solana is one of several competing¬† blockchains of course the original ethereum¬†¬† silica cardano Avalanche e-gold that hopes to¬† grow an ecosystem of cryptocurrency powered¬†¬† products and services to differentiate itself¬† Solana introduced a combination of architectural¬†¬† design choices that attempts to offer faster or¬† transaction settlement times and an infrastructure¬†¬† that focuses on flexibility that enables¬† developers to write and launch customizable¬†¬† applications in multiple programming languages¬† Solana attempts to achieve a superior level of¬†¬† transaction speed and blockchain scalability¬† Solana is doing this by building on top of¬†¬† several pillars of innovation that make the chain¬† faster and more secure these features or pillars¬†¬† are set to revolutionize the world of dapps and¬† transactions let's dig in Salon operates on top¬†¬† of eight core components or pillars to achieve¬† what it has achieved and aims to achieve proof¬†¬† of History Gulf Stream sea level turbine Cloud¬† break pipeline archivers while technologically¬†¬† complex and intricate each component is meant¬† to optimize the amount of transactions Solana¬†¬† can execute without sharding its chain or using¬† a layer 2 Network a little bit more detail Salon¬†¬† you uses a unique hybrid consensus mechanism¬† a combination of proof of stake and proof of¬†¬† work to achieve these faster confirmation¬† times to achieve the lower transaction fees¬†¬† and to reduce its energy consumption this is¬† compared to traditional proof of work the tldr¬†¬† on the architecture the way the chain is set up¬† is Solana and L1 chain offers Speedy streamlined¬†¬† transactions with instant finality low latency¬† and low cost with a peak daily average of 6¬†¬† 000 plus transactions per second it's one of¬† the fastest blockchains out there now before¬†¬† we move any further we need to address possibly¬† the biggest black mark on Solana's record Solana¬†¬† and FTX were very intertwined and getting more¬† intertwined over the past couple years Bloomberg¬†¬† had Austin Federer the head of strategy and¬† Communications at Solana Foundation to address¬†¬† exactly this along with Solana's 2023 strategy¬† in Outlook Solana became so so intertwined with¬†¬† FTX can Solana move past the FTX Fallout is that¬† possible Solana became very intertwined with the¬†¬† downfall of FTX with sambang of Reed had very¬† much been sort of a driving force in some ways¬†¬† as Solana become so popular but they held a lot¬† of it and there's a little worry that your price¬†¬† would fall on the back of for selling what's your¬† experience how do you move past the Fallout of FTX¬†¬† yeah if you look at the beginning of November¬† a lot of the headlines were Doom and Gloom for¬†¬† the Solana Network and what we've really seen¬† since then were about what two months out from¬†¬† from that initial news is active addresses are up¬† more people are using the network than were before¬†¬† there's actually more validators on the network¬† than before FTX collapsed so what we've seen is¬†¬† the community and developers all around the world¬† really come together and replace the parts of the¬†¬† ecosystem that had FTX involvement and then expand¬† from there so if you look at active addresses each¬†¬† day Salon is higher than all other blockchains¬† at this point it's just Solana had a historic¬†¬† relationship with SPF what is Solana doing to¬† move past this relationship in 2023 and going¬†¬† forward I have to ask you about Sam Bachman freed¬† the relationship or historic relationship between¬†¬† SPF and Solana what are you doing to move past¬† that relationship how what is the relationship¬†¬† in present day sure so you know in about in summer¬† of 2020 that was when Sam and FTX got involved in¬†¬† the Solana Network and they were building real¬† infrastructure on the network that couldn't be¬†¬† built on any other blockchain network serum¬† which was essential limit order book built on¬†¬† chain it was the first Central limit order book¬† deployed on a blockchain that code has been taken¬†¬† over by the community and relaunched to something¬† called open book and so that's kind of what I was¬†¬† talking about about the community healing parts¬† of the ecosystem that FTX and Sam were involved¬†¬† in I think moving past it though is really it's¬† on chain metrics right it's that users are still¬†¬† here developers are still building and there's a¬† lot of excitement around what's getting built on¬†¬† the network Solana Foundation is hoping that users¬† investors speculators judge the Solana network not¬†¬† based on their past relationship with Sam bankman¬† freed but the current state of the network the¬†¬† numbers so let's take a look at the numbers a new¬† report by Electric Capital shows that Solana is¬†¬† the fastest growing developer ecosystem surpassing¬† 2 000 total developers in 2022 its second in raw¬†¬† numbers only to ethereum it's interesting because¬† I remember in 2018 2019 when ethereum was low when¬†¬† ethereum was around 80 100 although the price was¬† low the developer metrics were just like this do¬†¬† you understand Solana has the most active devs¬† of any chain besides ethereum and the highest¬†¬† overall percent growth at 83 percent the total¬† number of developers on Solana grew 83 percent¬†¬† from December 2022 to a year earlier the fastest¬† rate of growth from any major change the total¬†¬† number of developers on Solana has grown more than¬† 10x since 2018 more than any other blockchain the¬†¬† fact is it's becoming easier to build on Solana¬† than ever before developer interest spikes around¬†¬† hackathons new courses and other developer¬† friendly in real life events you can see that¬†¬† here again Salon optimizing itself for the most¬† scalable with the lowest cost did you know that¬†¬† you need to perform approximately 2 600 priority¬† transactions to spend just one dollar worth of¬†¬† Soul even priority fees are extremely cheap on¬† Solana Solana has two modes now fast and cheaper¬†¬† or faster and cheap either way you're winning¬† with solanum so is buying Solana at this time¬†¬† like buying ethereum around eighty dollars maybe¬† even around a hundred dollars if Solana rallies¬†¬† five thousand seven hundred percent what is¬† the peak Solana price we could be looking at¬†¬† near the top of the next cycle 500 plus dollars¬† per 1 Solana coin tell me what you think in

evans",3890.0,62697,187,when would you think 27 000 for Bitcoin is a better buy something very strange just happened on CNBC you see Mike novogratz billionaire investor and CEO of Galaxy digital was brought on to talk about Bitcoin nothing new and the talking point unfortunately was bitcoin's declining price this conversation is going to start out totally normal they just say hey bitcoin's down eight percent for the month this is the first month this year that Bitcoins had a down month why are we dropping and is eight percent even a big deal eight percent with Bitcoin that's not even I mean you want a bad month 60 is a bad month for crypto Mike eight percent is like unch isn't it it's sideways it is actually it's sideways and if you think about it interest rates sold off you know 50 60 basis coins if you look at the Deferred you know sofa contracts um and so less chance of a dovish Fed should be hawkish for for crypto in general and so you know quite frankly cryptos uh laxidasical I'd say there's a constant bid from retail we're seeing it through all the platforms um and there's not a lot of institutional excitement right now and so uh the dog days of summer started early in crypto uh does it make me thrilled but that's just the reality no the female co-host as you'll hear she's actually the one shocked that Mike is taking this bullish stance on bitcoin because yes Bitcoin is dipping now but long term that said there's a couple things that happen today which are pretty interesting right WeChat just enabled Bitcoin and crypto trading on the biggest single platform in the world um that's a pretty big big deal uh Hong Kong is officially allowing crypto trading for retail customers uh through regulated exchanges first first time and so we're seeing Asian adoption uh and we're seeing you know like in some ways bitcoin's up 55 they're 65 this year ethereum up 55 percent uh on Lower volatility than we've seen and so in lots of ways there's been two of the best performing assets there are so don't just take Bitcoin on small time frames when in doubt zoom out and although Kelly the female host has yet to speak Joe Kernan like any good journalist pushes back a little uh last time you're on my someone took offense that that you you kind of conceded that a lot of the buying was by bit people that already own it or people that are already involved and there's no new Adoption and that that's a problem is that still um what we're seeing is the new buyers are all small and they're aggregated on these platforms if it's revolut or uh you know Robin Hood or or uh Square you know the cash app from Square uh and they continue to buy small amounts and hold them and so you know in some ways that makes a pretty healthy Market because these are long-term hodlers as they would say yeah we're not singers we're not seeing the institutions come in you know that that got stopped by a combination of Sam and Gary you know Sam Pacman freed and Gary Gensler and so you're seeing lots of Interest still just not a lot of activity so and here's where the conversation goes totally off the rails but very quickly I do just want to address are we actually seeing the buyers I.E the volume still today we can look at the Bitcoin price on the day chart and see a clear drop off in trading volume most other cryptocurrency YouTube channels will only share with you bullish news this channel we'll share with you all the news all the metrics so you can make the best decision for you and notice at the start of 2023 we had a huge uptick for the first time in a long time Bitcoin jumped in 2023 and then we also saw that volume profile the follow so a strong uptick in price and a strong consistent volume uptick as well this was a very good sign at the time that we may see one more uptick unfortunately after this next leg up about two months ago in March we saw a nice volume Spike to get us there but for the next two months volume was minuscule not the best sign it tells us hey this might not be sustainable I'm just as bullish as Mike novograt's long term about Bitcoin and I appreciate how he's cheerleading he's going on he's he's studying the troops but for any subscriber of this channel do not be surprised if we take a dip down in the short term just like don't be surprised if Mike is absolutely right and we keep grinding up I'm I'm going to keep an eye on these volume profiles and when something changes I will make a video I will keep you updated and finally let me share with you the end of this clip in full Joe Kernan who knows his co-host off screen is pressuring him to lay the smackdown on Mike as the harder questions the awkwardness to me is palpable will you help um Kelly with with her no no now uh you know you don't want myself no uh well we've been talking and it obviously it's totally about what your risk profile and tolerance is whether you buy a one-year t-bill or Mike or Bitcoin at 27. you don't like it no you have to tell me you would take a one-year T-Bone 5.2 all day long no you know listen you have to have someone in your T bills but right I've always kind of lived on the risk curve uh and listen we're in a bubble right now an AI bubble and so having watched bubbles my whole life it's a pretty exciting one and it's just starting and so it makes actually trading the stock market complicated because you know everyone's known that stat right 494 stocks of the s p are unchanged and the other six make up all the gains uh it feels early right the AI story is just starting in lots of ways we started using chat CPT what two three months ago um bubbles don't last three months they last a lot longer bubbles always happen around things that fundamentally change the way we live right bubbles happen around real things they just the story is so powerful people by way in advance and get caught up in the frenzy and so listen nasdaq's way outperformed it could continue to outperform it's a dangerous trade I hear him saying rather than Bitcoin rather than in the t-bill he wants to chase the the NASDAQ I don't know if you chase Nvidia that's that's what I'm hearing I'm just saying that that's having a big impact on the psychology of the market uh it's something we got to watch really carefully so what do these CNBC hosts know about Bitcoin the mic doesn't or maybe what does Mike know about Bitcoin that these hosts don't who's right today in this situation but uh in Long in you if you really were going to invest ten thousand dollars right now would you think 27 000 for Bitcoin is a better buy than a year where you get five hundred dollars back 100 because listen the FED is going to pause or skip or what do you want to call it listen to the billionaire listen to them and then we'll see the data come in and if the data continues to slow and it's listen it's mixed data right the the retail uh Services space continues to be vibrant and the rest of the economy is slowing but if if what I think is going to happen happens and we see a real slow down in the second half of the year the FED will be cutting rates by October uh and crypto is going to be Off to the Races I just think they're taking liquidity out Mike don't you I mean you you know these Dynamics better than anybody right like they're they're sucking liquidity out and what's remaining okay it's going into AI but the fact that it's going into AI is all the less reason why it needs to go into crypto yeah but they they will be hawkish until they're not and the moment this economy really turns we look at Chile all of a sudden right Chile was way ahead of America right they raised rates on 900 a thousand basis points and all of a sudden their economy is just rolled up rolled off a cliff uh and you'll see you know rate Cuts really fast I like to think that's the canary in the coal mine is one of my friend uh uh that calls it like the U.S economy will slow all these interest rate hikes will have impact the banking crisis will stop lending to small businesses which will finally show up in in employment it just takes a while and so I think if we're talking in October the FED will have a very different tone and that will be the Catalyst for assets especially gold silver Bitcoin ethereum to head higher my brother and I are speaking at the Block down Festival in Portugal link down below use

talking about my top three cryptos you should be looking into for this upcoming month of April now if you haven't noticed crypto has actually been up these past couple of weeks mainly because of all the banking issues and collapses that we're seeing around the world but people are finally starting to realize that crypto might not be a bad place to hold your money and because of that we're starting to see some more price movement but the question on everyone's Minds is will this continue or will we start to see prices come back down I personally think the bottom is in and we're only going to be going up but you guys came here to see what cryptos you should be looking into so let's get into that as always make sure you guys smash that like button subscribe if you guys haven't already I make videos all about crypto and how you can become rich from it so if that interests you guys make sure you guys subscribe but without further Ado let's get into the video all right coming up first we have a project called arbitrim now if you're a little more involved in the crypto Community you've probably already heard of this coin or project especially in these past couple of months and the reason for that is because of its Infamous ear drop where they gave away close to 10 thousand dollars for free now if you don't know what an airdrop is it's basically when a company or project provides free tokens in exchange for using their services now the thing that makes Arbitrage airdrop kind of unique is they never actually announced they were going to do an airdrop at all it was all complete speculation just the community had a strong feeling they would and they ended up doing it anyway I think the max you could have gotten was 10 000 ARB tokens and if we value that at its current price right now which is about one dollar it would be worth close to ten thousand dollars not bad for some free money but regardless that's the past nothing we can do about it how can we make money with arbitrum going in the future though first off what is arbitrum and why is everyone talking about it well Arbitrage is a layer 2 ethereum solution and I know we hear that all the time but arbitrum is a little different from the rest you can think of it like being another polygon the goal for polygon or any other layer 2 solution is to help scale and grow the layer 1 project and in this case it would be for ethereum now what makes arbitrum unique is a couple of things and I'll talk about some right now and I also talk about some more important ones on my computer so make sure you continue watching but the first thing is is they're super user friendly and that's something a lot of other layer twos aren't and nowadays that's all developers care about how simple it is to work on an ecosystem now the way they hook developers into using arbitrim is that they use programming language such as solidity and Viper which are the same exact programming languages that ethereum uses and it also runs on ethereum virtual machine or evm which pretty much makes it an identical experience as if a developer was building something on ethereum's network and because of this this allows developers with projects on ethereum to easily and quickly move it over to arbitrum's network without doing a lot of work also another reason why I think it's going to be big is because it uses something called optimistic rollups which is basically taking a bunch of transactions off the chain combining them all together into one transaction and then sending that one transaction into ethereum's Network at the same time by doing this it results in lower gas fees and faster trans action times about forty thousand transactions per second can be done on an Arbitrage Network compared to just 14 on ethereums but the main reason why the community loves Arbitrage so much is because when you switch over to Arbitrage Network for example if you're using metamask to interact with adapt it will still show up as eth meaning you're on another network but you can still use it exactly as if you're on ethereum's network but with cheaper fees and the community absolutely loves this and it's not just for metamask arbitrum is integrated with tons of other D5 protocols like sushi swap curve and bunch more alright I just want to quickly show you how big Arboretum really is so I'm on D5 llama right now which pretty much just shows the total value locked amongst all the other chains so we can see ethereum has 28 almost 30 billion Tron has almost 5 billion a binance smart chain has 5 billion as well if we scroll down look at what's in the fourth place arbitrum arbitrum is higher than polygon higher than Avalanche in terms of total value lack sitting at 2.2 billion now yes that's a high number and and probably other projects have hit that number before nothing crazy but what's crazy is Arboretum was only launched in August 2021 it hasn't even been a full two years yet and it's ranked number four higher than polygon higher than all these other cryptos that have been around for years what does that show that shows how much support Arboretum has as a community that shows how much people believe in arbitrum which is a huge sign like 2.2 billion locked in less than two years I want you guys to understand that's not something easy to do and if we look at Uni swap which probably has a total value locked amongst uh decentralized exchanges arbitrum is sitting at number two with 291 million dollars in total value locked now if we look at the chart and the price for Arbitron like I said it's sitting around a dollar but the thing is this coin is really new the project has been out since April 2021 but the coin just dropped I think legit like five days ago like a week ago before me making this video and uh it started out at ten dollars I saw a whole bunch of tweets and people are like uh the coin is gonna be ten dollars there's no way it's gonna be ten dollars it was just an IOU but a lot of people who got like 4 000 um ARB tokens were saying I just made forty thousand dollars for doing nothing but obviously when the coin launched it sitting at close to a dollar which you know still getting 4 000 ARB tokens worth four thousand dollars that's not bad for doing nothing but so far this this Project's doing really good if we go over to the markets tab finance kucoin a lot of large exchanges already support them over a over 200 million dollars in volume just on binance alone in under a week I would say that that's really good numbers and then obviously if you look at the technical analysis as always I'm using Lux algo that tells me when to buy and sell um I talk about them all the time but if you guys want signals like this I'll put a link to it down below but it's not much to go off of because the coin is very new this is honestly just a super long-term bullish play um it's a super new coin it hasn't even gone through a bull run um and we have so much money sitting inside of it so I don't know for me I see a lot of potential in this coin you guys can do your own research but this is a coin I have my eyes on very very heavily all right coming up next on the list is uni swap now this is a coin many of you probably already know and possibly own but for some reason no one's talking about it anymore which is kind of weird because when you look at their numbers and the stuff they're doing you would think everyone would be talking about this coin now I'm not gonna bore you with too much of the basics because like I said I assume a lot of you guys already know what it is and how it works but basically what makes uni swap unique is that it's an exchange a decentralized exchange meaning there's no single company that owns it for example like coinbase and binance those are centralized exchanges owned by physical companies which require you to trust your money in those companies hands and we've seen first hand how that went with all these hacks and scams on these centralized exchanges Yoni swap on the other hand is a completely different type of exchange that's fully decentralized meaning it isn't owned by anyone it's what you can call a peer-to-peer exchange now the reason you should be looking into uni swap is tour words defy and Innovation uni swap pretty much put defy on the map they made it easily accessible to a lot of people and without uni swap we honestly wouldn't have half of these huge cryptos that we talked about today and it was until after uni swap came out we started to see other competitors like pancake swap Sushi Swap and a whole bunch of other exchanges start to pop up as well but you know what's funny all those different exchanges do one thing and that's copy uni swap if you look at how they work and all the updates they make they pretty much mimic uni swap exactly and the reason is is because uni swap knows what they're doing over the past three years they've had three huge updates that consistently made the platform better to use and provided more features that people love also the way they are structured it allows new projects to be listed on their platform very easily now you can look at that both ways so I'll leave that up to you guys how you guys want to look at it but if we also just look at the future of crypto we're only going to have more adoption and with these centralized exchanges getting hacked left and right people are going to look for Alternatives and that taxes or decentralized exchanges are that next big thing they allow you to trade earn rewards have low fees fast transaction times which a lot of people are looking for a couple things about uni swap the first thing was as I was filming this I just got a strong signal that popped up on this indicator so um obviously be too late by the time you guys watch this video but this would have been a good position to take um but for uni swap the thing I want to show you guys it's it's all-time high which was close to about 42 dollars now uni swap has been like I said around for a really long time the coin dropped in 2020 but the the project has been out since I believe like 2018 2019 but the cool thing about uni swap is it actually had an airdrop just like arbitrum I remember because I got uni swaps airdrop I was using it before and they airdropped us 400 tokens and I remember when I got it here like when I got it I was surprised because if you do 400 tokens times three dollars at the time that was twelve hundred dollars that was a lot of money back then um and I just held on to it because I really saw potential and then look at the look at the price so honestly I didn't I held half so I got 400 tokens obviously I picked up more uni swap along the way but I sold half around over here around a 20 Mark but I still have the other 200 but if I were to have kept the 400 and I sold at the 42 Mark I would have made almost 17 000 off of a free airdrop that just goes to show the power of airdrops and the potential it has but regardless you can clearly see that uni swap is down a lot if we head over here to the daily chart we can see that your swaps down almost 90 percent from his all-time high just like every other crypto but uni swap is one of those cryptos that I can easily easily see it going back up to forty dollars because like I said it has the potential it's ranked number five in total value lock with 3.86 billion it's always making changes everyone loves you when you swap there's no issues with it so for me it's it's like honestly a no-brainer I've always just been picking it up and it's always been like a sleeper coin like I said that no one talks about but I know in the future everyone will be talking about it all right and finally we have a project called Aurora now I'm gonna be honest this is a little more on the riskier side but it could have a lot of potential so make sure you guys watch this whole section through now Aurora you can think of being like the polygon or arbitrum for near it serves as a layer 2 solution to make the near blockchain more efficient and easily accessible to more people and one of the biggest ways Aurora provides this is by being evm because for near the biggest drawback is it's not evm compatible and since evm is most widely known people prefer to work with cryptos that use that language so that's where Aurora comes in it allows ethereum developers to easily come over and build on near with the same language that's pretty much the biggest Pro for Aurora because unlike polygon which offers fast transaction times and cheaper fees for ethereum the year already offers fast and cheap transactions alright so a couple things about Aurora the biggest thing is a lot of people don't know this but Aurora actually offers a 30 AP staked apy which is absurd and no one talks about this because it is a lower key coin it's ranked number 500 on coin market cap with a mark a volume of only 600 000 but 30 apy is not bad but the thing is that looks good but on the back end it's not the best because when you have higher API when people get their returns or their their money back so if I deposit 100 I get 130 back because of thirty percent you're gonna look to sell it and I think a lot of people are doing that because when we go over here to the price of Aurora it's down really really bad so 34 from dollars from this all-time high down to almost 50 Cent 50 18 cents which is I would say even close to like a 99 drop in its price and another thing I'm not a big fan of with Aurora is their tokenomics they have 16 uh that's a lacked up for long-term incentives and the nine percent that's locked up for private round investors the thing is when you have this much money or percentage locked up early when people get this money they always resort to selling and taking their money back out and we can clearly see this is what happened here now obviously the bear Market played an effect but I'm 100 sure a lot of people got their money back and they just sold out of this coin and that's one of the reasons why I say it's more of a riskier play but other than that like it has a whole bunch of dapps on its ecosystem that you can use and there's some pretty big names on here um but the biggest thing is is it relates to near and I'm really bullish on the air and if you're bullish on the air it goes hand in hand so if we could see over here around like January 1st 2022 we saw its all-time high if you ever hear January 2022 we saw the all-time high for Aurora so um I'm if you want to make this bet or if you want to buy into Aurora the biggest thing would be to first you have to be bullish on near but your hope for the nearest Price to go up in the next Bull Run in Aurora's price to follow that would be the best outcome but that was it for today's video Guys these were some of the coins that I think you guys should be looking into that I think have a lot of potential in the future as always make sure you guys do your own research this is not Financial advice at all and if you guys don't know how to do your own research I just made a video last week talking about how I do my own research and how you guys can find kryptos before everybody else so if you guys want to check that out I'll put a link to that video down below but other than that I hope you guys have a great rest of your day and I'll see you guys in next week's video peace

It is time to take a look at the crypto market after the last week's run.  We are seeing a flight to safety with crypto.  The chance of a crypto crash this week is still here and I take a look at how things are going over the last few days. We look at the Ethereum price prediction and the Bitcoin price prediction.  We watched the crypto market crash last night and now it is slowly recovering.  I am taking this as a chance to add on some additional altcoins out there.  I believe that Sandbox will be one of the best Meta cryptos to own.    I also go over the Shiba Inu coin price prediction and where the Shiba Inu coin price could head.  I see some upward price movements in 2022 for the Shib coin price.    I go over three of the biggest market cap Metaverse cryptos out there.  The first is one that I own already, which is the Decentraland Mana crypto.  I am excited to see it rising from where I bought it already.  The Mana price prediction I had out there is for it to hit $5.00 a token very soon.  The Mana price should continue to rise in the next few months.    The next of the best Metaverse cryptos to buy now is the Sandlot token SAND.  I can see SAND price prediction doubling as well from the current price over the next few months as more attention is paid towards this space.  We will see if the SAND token can grow from its current market cap up to where I believe it should be...about 3-4 times current price.  The metaverse crypto to buy now.  Top metaverse crypto to buy now is out there.  The Mana price prediction is big and so is the Sand price prediction.  üí†Stock Moe's Patreon  https://www.patreon.com/stockmoe Stock Moe Discord is included with a Stock Moe Patreon Tiered Pledge.

BEST CRYPTOS TO BUY NOW {TOP CRYPTOS TO BUY MAY 2023}  #Ethereum #crypto #bitcoin",838.0,14316,96,welcome back everyone for those that don't know I'm stockmo an old financial advisor and educator now doing this YouTube thing all I ever ask hit that like button hit the Subscribe button today we're taking a look at the 11 best cryptos to buy now that's right we're gonna get out there and I'm gonna show you the ones that I personally love and if I was going to start a brand new portfolio today and you said pick 11. these are the 11 that I would throw in there for all we'll say unique reasons for each one we're gonna go through these we're gonna take a look and compare them to the overall Market in the equities what would have been better to buy stocks would it have been better to buy treasuries would it have been better to buy crypto and as you know some altcoins run some don't but at the end of the day in my opinion these are the best cryptos to buy now Bar None I love them now before we get into it make sure you take advantage of the MooMoo link down below as you can see get up to 15 free stocks if you deposit thousand dollars you get 15 free stocks worth up to two thousand a piece put 100 in you'll get five free stocks worth up to two thousand a piece now if you from Australia folks don't sleep on this get 10 free stocks for depositing two thousand or more Australian dollars deposit any amount get three free stocks so take advantage of that and then of course move uh the Weeble Lake any deposit down below you can buy crypto there and you get up to 12 free stocks worth up to thirty thousand six hundred that's with any deposit my friends now we get into it what are we looking at I want to go buy the NASDAQ right so let's go buy the NASDAQ take a look at the last month because the last time I made a list of the best cryptos to buy now we know that some of the top cryptos ended up doing well some of them other ones not so much but it wasn't a wild month for the crypto industry so the nasdaq's up 2.1 we're going to use that as The Benchmark but as we move into the first of the best cryptos to buy now of course I always want to have a little bit of the old dog in there airpod is going to set up a brand new portfolio and that's Bitcoin that to me is your your standard and look at this over the last month this coin what are we looking at oh point zero four percent nothing is basically flat so compared to the overall NASDAQ we would have been better off not to be in it now I do want to show you this I'm going to put this in each video each one of these cryptos you can pause read about it and you can go over what these cryptos are about I used to do this when I was a teacher I don't want to waste your time I know you know how to read so you can go ahead and pause the video when I scroll down to that you can read what each one's about now the next one this is my all-time favorite for anybody that knows the top crypto to invest in today in my opinion the number one crypto to buy now is ethereum at least for mine I never tell you what to buy and sell on this channel just what I'm doing I've been loading up on ethereum I have over a hundred ethereum I'm trying to get up to 200 this is what I love I have a steak I'm getting my staking rewards it is dropped though but even over the last month though even though it's dropped from up to the 2000 look where we're at still a 5.44 that's the thing about crypto is you never know where it's gonna go ethereum had the Shanghai update of course that allowed people to unstake their ethereum and that is an ongoing process so as we see that kind of work through the system you're going to see a lot of volatility out there but the good news like I said before look at ethereum up 5.44 compare that to what I just showed you for the NASDAQ we actually Beat It we more than doubled it with ethereum so I'm happy with that it's my number one investment in terms of one position having money this is it ethereum is it it's the big one now Solana I wanted to go into it but before we do I got to make sure I show you this I want everybody to be able to read about it there you go boom boom boom down we go and we're going back over to Solana now now we move into some of these uh altcoins out there that have the potential to become defy uh game Breakers if you will this could be some big stuff and Solana has quite the following but over the last month 2.5 percent compare that to the NASDAQ 2.1 Solana did its thing and is outperformed now we're going to come back and take a look at the year chart but before we do I do want to do the monthly thing so you can see what's going on here and we'll come back up and then we move on to my next one cardano now when we look at cardano I like this thing I think cardano has the opportunity to do some wonderful things and look at the last month it's gotten a lot of love 6.57 of course everything's kind of falling down uh since the middle of April and the question becomes does it continue uh now we had a nice I would say almost flat here going across so we're back down that level I think that's going to be some good support I don't think we're going to go too much further below but you never know if bad things happen the debt crisis in D.C you don't know regulations anything out there but right now I do like cardano now as we look at cardano understand the volatility for all cryptos out there I try to stick to the ones I think really could be game changers and like I said there's a lot of things out there that you can read about you can learn about these definitely pause the video if you don't know anything about the ones I'm mentioning and if you have one in particular you would like me to go over in depth tell you all about it let me know in the comments which one of these that I'm going through is going to be your favorite crypto to add to your portfolio which one of these cryptos are going to be the ones that could explode moving forward to the point that we see 10 20 30 100 times our money let me know down below now the next one Avalanche this is the one I haven't made a major purchase she's on yet I want to I'm still watching it I'm still debating it I like it uh not sure though and like I said I when you look at some of these you have the opportunity to get in at levels that we haven't seen in a while because you say what do you mean Mo well look at this this thing at one time 75 percent down uh it was up over 60 or around there uh in the last year right around 60 in the last year so you see a lot of these prices that we haven't had in a long time and so for people to have it down this low if you're going to be a long-term holder for some of these cryptos you have a chance now one of the best cryptos to buy uh in my opinion Matic it has a rough last month 9.96 but I gotta tell you I still I really really like this one for the long term you can read about it here uh built and it's a scaling solution for the ethereum blockchain has good opportunities and then we move on I know there's a lot of fans when it comes to this top crypto to buy now chain link and if I had to put it in the portfolio like I said I have some of this already you can see my portfolios my crypto portfolios and everything else over at the Discord and on patreon so it's all there I'm buying a bunch of stuff today so it's your opportunity the markets are getting open you're going to be able to see what I'm doing if you want to follow along you want to take it to the next level join the patreon down below I don't know what you're waiting for it's a good thing chain link though as you can see how has not had a good month so far that is also down about 3.44 what you'll notice with a lot of my cryptos that I like very strongly not all of them but very strongly tied to the ethereum blockchain for good reason I'm a if you can't see the Hat guy I'm a big ethereum fan the next one Mana these have been getting beat up the metaverse is not as hot as it was at one time we were hoping to see it explode or you'd like to see the investments in there we didn't get it in the last month down 6.15 for those who are taking what are you talking about you can read about it right here and of course as we move into the next best metaverse crypto to buy now there's two that I like sandbox and man if I had to get into them which I am these are the ones I would consider but I gotta tell you they've been getting beat up 8.37 down and you can read about this one as well here another very uh related to the ethereum block chain an erc20 all right now we move into the best cryptos by now for the what are we talking about with these ones we're talking about the retail place so Dogecoin this is to me I like this one the best I know others out there are Shiba Inu I like this one the best four point three one percent has the uh Elon Musk tied to it you can read about it here I really like this one I I can't remember when it went live for mining but it was back 2013 2014-ish uh I was mining this day one and when I mined this I was getting about 200 000 Doge a day which at one time was worth a hundred and something thousand dollars a day that I didn't even know it was going to get up that high that's when this was 60 something cents a piece so my nightmare story for everyone is that I sold them all back when I got hardly anything for them and then they blew up so I could have been a multi-gazillionaire if I would have kept all my dose coin and not sold them but I did I turned them into Bitcoin and as some people don't know my Bitcoin got stolen but I had it on a on a platform a platform person who uh created it the company and everything else the person who was behind it ended up stealing everyone's crypto and running away now that person's in prison I believe forever uh they caught him finally and I never got my crypto back unfortunately so now uh that's a warning to everyone be careful out there now Shiba Inu there you go and this is the other retail play for those that don't know about Shima Inu you can hear another ethereum based mean point and this has 3.84 percent down so now I gave you a list but I wanted to show you the best cryptos to buy now over the last year how they done because this has been the crypto winner are we out of the winner that's the million dollar question 56 percent down for Shiba Inu Dogecoin over the last year 39 we'll see who's the best and who's the worst uh the metaverse plays I expect to be hammered 78 in decentral land down 71 then we move into uh chain link where 45 down polygon this is Matic down 23 not bad compared to so far I think this is leading the pack and then of course we get into Avalanche 75 down cardano you know I like my D5 plays 55 Solana 78 then we move into ethereum 35 and then of course Bitcoin should be uh the one I would thought would have won not so fast my friend 29.49 which was your winner I believe polygon 23.75 down over the last year and so my question everyone here do you own any of these do you believe they should is there do you believe any of these should be on the list of the best cryptos to buy now or shouldn't be on the list of best cryptos to buy now let me know down below which crypto did I miss that should be on the list put it in the comments let's have some fun talk about about it now where do these things go and I'm going to put it bluntly I believe we're going to have a recession coming up but at and during that recession we'll probably see some selling off of riskier assets including crypto nothing too bad but once we get through that and I think that happens all within 2023 I think we run and we start the next major bull cycle for crypto and I think that's going to last a few years and we'll see what happens but that's my take on it I'm going to continue the dollar cost average come on over the patreon and see exactly what I'm buying and I do have down below the links to Weeble and moo moos take advantage of them get those free stocks I appreciate you stopping by let's get out there and make some money

I got some bad news coming out of Gary Gensler he said something in an interview that you're not even going to believe plus I have information on what happens it starts raining here uh what happens when the US government prints lots of currency what happens to the crypto Market I'm gonna get into all that but please first like And subscribe And subscribe to our uh CT Club it's down below we get our trade alerts portfolio updates and much more we've been buying a lot of micro caps lately they've been doing great okay so let me get into this before I begin on those two subjects we have the entire market cap of of uh of all coins is about 560 billion dollars all right and so a lot of people are asking where is this money gonna come from that you know that's going to make the next bull market well Tech dev has a good good statement here so he says Nvidia added 220 billion dollars in 16 hours but where does the money come from so there's a lot of people waiting on the sidelines a lot of big money way down the sidelines just waiting to buy and so there's always going to be those people and so you don't have to wonder where the money is always coming from it's like where did the money come from in 2017-2018 it was retail big money and then now we have countries having it as a re-reserved currency and also companies having it on their balance sheet pretty interesting you could not have guessed that it would come that soon in 2017-2018. so there's plenty of money are out there out there okay next we have the Chinese Central television station has just broadcasted news regarding Hong Kong letting people buy Bitcoin ethereum and all and other coins so what does this mean it means that governments are always going to change their mind you know depending on what day it is just depending on what what year it is whatever it doesn't matter governments Can't Ban crypto they just can't you can't shut down an idea like this and there's going to be huge money to be made uh regardless of what government's gonna do but you know what ride the wave the Chinese wave so now you have a lot of Chinese coins they could do really well now uh depending on you know who's going to be buying this so now we have this is from library and you know what I feel kind of bad for the library they're just getting picked on big time but they say something they brought up what Gary Gensler had to say right so they said uh us Regulators aren't misled they they are not making innocent mistakes there's not a misunderstanding or factual disagreement all right they're just lying Psychopaths I agree because look what he said this isn't when Gary Gensler was interviewed okay by Tom Barkin he says Tom Barkin asked Gary can you comment about the dispute with coinbase about the rules on crypto why doesn't the SEC want to publish rules for that market Gensler says this is really bad news for the US really bad news Tom the rules have already been published he's lying they haven't been published so literally he's letting crypto companies run blind in the U.S just waiting to fall in traps set by the US government really evil next we have the fed that's going to print four trillion dollars in two years last time when the FED printed trillions in 2020 Bitcoin went from 3 800 to 69 000 in less than two years I don't think a lot of people actually understand how bullish that is okay so let's go to Eric Voorhees now he says it took over 200 years of federal U.S federal debt to hit the first two trillion dollars it now takes one year for every two additional two trillion dollars so every year another two trillion dollars and that number is going to keep spiking up and up and up like a lot of people don't understand this like a lot of people that were worried about the debt that ceiling and maybe it's not going to be raised whatever guys we haven't seen anything yet with the amount of printing that's going to be going on and I've I've been Heidi and I have been saying this for years now ever since I first day I started on this channel because I knew that inflation was going to go ravage all right and there's no stopping this currency printing so now Eric voices to end this uh he says consider that GDP is 25 comprised of federal federal spending so each dollar government spends is going to help make GDP look like it's rising yes so the higher GD GDP grows potentially the more debt is is being created right so now even so the federal debt is growing much faster than GDP so Eric Voorhees he knows what's up he knows what's going to happen so do I this is what one of the reasons why Heidi and I started this channel is to inform others and educate people on this uh and keep in mind Bitcoin is your savior essentially that's the best inflation hedge in the world has ever seen so if you want to protect yourself from what the government is doing and will continue to do non-stop buy some Bitcoin anyways that's all I have talk to you soon bye

#xJAYAMI #crypto",743.0,25576,82,thank you to EA for giving me this opportunity and for sponsoring this video crypto has been out for quite some time his kit and playstyle has evolved meaning the possibilities are endless when it comes to mastering this Legend in which even the algorithm cannot predict join myself and the other crypto Mains as we find out what it truly means to be off the grid new in season 16 his Recon class perk allows him to scan the survey beacons to find enemies throughout the map similar to his map room but be careful and time your scans as you want to know the last location of nearby enemies before pushing them and each scan can be used once per POI that contains the beacon when in drone view an important tip is to check the banners around the map to find the amount of squads in the area the range is calculated from crypto and has a radius of 200 meters which is roughly the size of your mini-map you can use this information to determine how to approach fights and once you've finished check for nearby third parties that may have heard you as you're initiating a fight you'd want to throw your drone at a 35 degree angle this ensures that you utilize the Drone scan radius of 30 meters and its detection radius of 240 degrees tap your Tactical to send your drone 23 meters forward in theory this creates a distance of visibility to anticipate enemies like bloodhounders and just like a mirage decoy it gives enemies a split second decision whether to shoot the Drone which allows you to push and deal the initial damage or let them prepare for the push as they are continuously scanned with a cooldown of 40 seconds is important to keep your drone healthy you can do so by recalling your drone when you see its Health while going down enemies and their traps doors Supply bins and loot ticks are all highlighted by the Drone in addition to this you can pick up Fallen teammates banners and instantly revive them the ultimate can be activated in or out of the Drone you should push after an EMP as enemies are stunned for a few seconds running away or healing leaving them vulnerable and EMP without an aggressive push is essentially a waste of an ultimate can stun and deal 50 damage to yourself and enemies and slow everyone caught in the area of effect the damage also Stacks up your EvoShield giving you free damage EMP also directly affects 14 out of the 23 Legends such as gibraltar's bubble or stick traps while some fences and pylon catalysts ferrofluid and more your Tactical the surveillance drone is the jack of all trades master of none it could provide so much Intel to your game and more holding your Tactical button will launch the Drone by 4 meters which you would then be able to enter drone view throw it on the floor or by cover as you want to prevent your drone from being shot down which is a very important tip to note as I see a few crypto players throwing it in the air thinking it's the only way to go you can also protect yourself by using those few seconds of going into drone by sliding into cover to add to this utilize the buildings and environments for cover this improves your scan and EMP potential and reduces the chance of the Drone being destroyed information such as minimap ring timer how many squads left kills and damage Lobby kill feed health bar and shield and ALT percentage are displayed in your drone user interface you are able to Ping within your drone or use your will to provide information to your teammates this is very beneficial if you do not use voice chat when in drone view you can open doors Supply bins and care packages you can also open vaults if you have the vault key in your inventory if you've used up ammo in the mag going into drone view reload your weapons for you but it takes the same time as it would if you did it manually this is great for providing quick Intel by going into your drone first when the team is pushing and once you get out of drone view you'll be able to shoot your weapons you can recall your drone back or you can go out the drones 240 meter range which will automatically come back to you be careful not to recall the Drone when you're Reviving teammates or using charge towers as it interrupts the process you may notice a green circle on your reticle within 17 meters the reticle will highlight bright green meaning that when you deploy the Drone it will rotate itself facing away from the wall this is great for covering blind spots or creating a cctv-like scenario which the Drone will watch certain angles in addition to the benefits you can create a distraction by placing the drone on the wall giving you free scans and creating pressure on the enemy team you can place the Drone in bushes and trees although some trees May block Vision or pathway stopping you from going through them like in broken moon it's a great way to have free scans and also makes the Drone harder to be seen and shot down you can also place the Drone to see through Windows to scan enemies although some windows block the scan think of the Drone as your fourth reliable teammate watching your back and notifying you when needed if your drone detects enemies or is destroyed you can make the call to disengage rotate elsewhere or look to fight the oncoming team a technique to distract enemies for a split second would be to fly your drone high in the air but still be able to utilize its 30 meter scan radius to force them to look into the sky to destroy a small pixelated drone this will allow you to push up freely giving you first Contact of the fight you can also use this distraction created from the gun noise to attract nearby enemies you can leave your drone outside the ring to scan for unsuspecting teams as the Drone sound is masked by the ring audio and the orange aura Blends in with the ring this tip is more useful in ranked but use your drone to scout for unoccupied spaces for your team to push too this can give you the advantage for being in a good spot for zone or for pinching teams when looking to climb up the ranks bring your drone Up When approaching fights to earn free assists however do not stay in drone for too long and grieve your teammates a balance of drone usage and fighting abilities are needed to rank up properly look for unopened bins and open them in drone to earn five crafting materials giving you the ability to craft what you need instead of having to run around the area one of the most dangerous ultimates in the game the EMP deals a hundred to active corsic traps and destroys and active barrels 100 to octane's jump pad and removes the amp section of rampart's walls and disables stationary Sheila for around 20 seconds it also deals 100 damage to both parts of newcastle's mobile Shields and permanently disables the electricity on his Ultima it also cancels valcol if she has Shield EMP also destroys lober's Black Market Sears exhibit Mirage decoys and lifeline's healing drone coordinating emps with your teammates that use a movement Legend ability such as octane's pad Horizon Q Rave portal or Pathfinder Zips can catch enemies off guard as they are healing or running away making escapes impossible with discount Nation try to exit your drone a few seconds before your EMP detonates that gives you those crucial moments to catch enemies awaiting their Doom the Reliance on having to pick up Fallen teammate banners with your drone aren't as important anymore since support players are able to craft their banners back but still remember your drone's 200 meter range to take your time and create a safe distance between your enemies to pick up the banners you can also help create that safe distance by EMP enemies as you grab the banner lowering their sensitivity making it hard for them to track and shoot the Drone as crypto has lost the ability to scan the next ring you can somewhat determine the next Zone by looking at the enemies that are crowded together this also means you might be able to third party if you're fast enough or look for fights that are more isolated from everyone else stopping you from being third-partied as well unfortunately crypto has no moving abilities is important to learn movement techniques and memorize building layouts to Advantage for quick and easy escapes carry at least one Autumn accelerant which removes roughly A Min net of your cooldown this prepares for unexpected fights in which you don't have your ultimate already and you can use one after the fight to prepare for the next one it is also very useful to craft or carry a Mobile Beacon you can rest teammates in the safe spot instantly especially if your support Legend teammates craft the banner back some cryptos have a tendency of hitting themselves with their EMP so it's useful to wear gold armor to heal yourself quickly if there are any enemies in the vicinity you may need to self EMP if you've taken any short damage self EMP remotely and immediately pop any Shield or use armor swaps in death boxes or floor loot to pounce on your enemies quicker there's always much to learn when playing as crypto but the important tip you can take away from this video is to not stay in your drone for long periods of time the only excuse would be if your team is holding down an area or building you can use a drone to scout the area ensure you keep drone usage to a minimum especially when you're moving around the map so you can stay with your team or myself I like to keep moving and using the a few seconds of my time to check the banners and Beacon or tapping my tactical to launch the Drone for oncoming enemies that's it for this video it's been a pleasure creating these tips and tricks video and again thank you EA for sponsoring this video

guys and welcome back to another video so in this video i'm actually going to be talking about how to make 100 per day trading either bitcoin or all coins the previous video that i made on this topic actually got over 1.1 million views so i thought it's been a few years it's time to refresh and update that video with some new practices and also some better techniques there are so many more altcoins out there right now in the market and i think there is much better ways we can actually be going out there and making profit from trading them so in today's video i'm going to be going through some techniques on how you can find these coins to trade um on coin market cap and other websites how you can in fact trade them um using platforms like binance buybit femex and also how you can chart them as well on trading view i'm going to be telling you all that information completely for free all i ask for you in today's video is simply drop a like and that would be absolutely amazing so guys without any further ado let's jump into the chart so let's jump into the computer and get on with today's video all right guys so now we are in the computer if you haven't already definitely subscribe to the channel i'm going to be posting so many more tutorials like this and also almost daily bitcoin and all coin analysis so definitely subscribe you don't want to miss out on these future videos so right now we are on a website called coin market cap if you don't know what this is this basically aggregates all the different cryptocurrencies out there and it lets you see price action movements information about them and everything like that so coin market cap is pretty much where i start my day always i log on to coin market gap in the morning and check the prices check my portfolio as well you can track your portfolio on here and overall just have a look at the general health of the market one of the great things about coin market cap though is you can search by 24 hours or you can filter and sort by 24 hours and seven days for example here we can see uh ceelo has gained 24 percent that's the highest gainer today in the last 24 hours and we can also check on seven days as well and the highest gain in here again is celo we have die and quant as well um yeah basically that's what we can do there also we can select uh the the losers here for down 41 percent down 35 percent on seven days and on 24 hours down 7 down 6.5 as well this is where it starts to get very interesting and this is usually how i go about finding the coins which i want to trade one of the things if we can select a coin on the seven day chart which is actually down by quite a lot this could potentially reveal a buying opportunity right here we can see uh kusama amp internet computer near portugal phantom um ravine horizon neo polkadot as well and some of these coins are even really good like polka dots ranked number nine we have neo uh we have amp here we have kosama all these coins are great coins to ontology nexo ave thought chain all these coins are great great coins it's not like we're trying to trade [¬†__¬†] coins or anything like that these are all uh coins with a huge market cap which you can see right here also we want to check out the volume as well volume i like to have a decent amount of volume at least around 50 million or 30 to 50 million at least here we can see we have 180 million 45 million um right here 165 million all of these have plenty plenty plenty of volume here we have around um just below four million which definitely is on the lower side of things probably i wouldn't want to go ahead and trade something like that depends really on how much you're trading with you can get in and out on trades but if the volume is lower it's going to be more difficult if you make a lot of profit to in fact get out of that trade so that's the first thing you want to do you want to go to corn market cap and identify the um old coin which you want to trade also there's another website which makes it a little bit more fun it's called cryptobubbles.net and you can go over here and select for example the hour you can select the day and right here it makes it a little bit more full fun for example if we click on link right here we can see the chart overall here trending downwards we can see the volume the rank and everything like that so it's a really interesting chart to see here on the day also the week we can see as well for example if things are down in the week now in the markets as i'm filming this we've had a fairly rough week we can see many things down 20 and more percent for example um theta down 25 percent linked down 15 a ksm down 42 so we can see a lot of opportunities here in the market if we go on the month we had a few different green ones but nothing really too crazy and on the year most likely we're going to be all green yeah we can see we've had a huge year look at doge here right here uh 10.5 000 up which is absolutely crazy so then what we want to do is go ahead and find ourselves a coin to trade one thing i did want to point out though guys before we get any further in today's video if you want more knowledge about how to trade if you want more advice more strategies more techniques if you want the support that you need to in fact go ahead and make profitable trades link down below i have my bitcoin blueprint and this is pretty much your a to z guide on how to make money with cryptocurrency how to trade for long term and a day trade swing trade how to invest for the long term as well in cryptocurrency in here we've had already thousands of students and successful students as well and i would really um welcome you to go ahead and check out the link down below in today's video and you can even book a free strategy and assessment call with ben our student success manager or marty as well um and you can go ahead and talk about the blueprint for 20 minutes on a completely free call all that will be linked down below also guys all the exchanges featured in today's video we have binance we have femex as well where i have a trade open in around 66 000 us dollars in profit and we have buy bit as well all of these different platforms have bonuses for example buy bit right now around 1 600 femax is around 200 bonus uh binance as well that will be updated and linked down below all these exchanges have bonuses and in order to get those bonuses all you have to do is join using my link down there i get a bonus you get a bonus everyone's happy and hopefully we can make some profitable trades so for example what you want to do is go over to call my call market cap here and sort by seven days right here we have kosama right here and if you want to click on that like that you want to see which exchange it's hosted on for example go down here and click market and then when that loads you can see okay the most the highest volume here is on binance and it's in a usdt pairing so then what you would want to do is you want to simply um go over to binance you'd want to go over and make yourself an account if you haven't already with the link down below click advanced like so this will bring up the um the exchange if you haven't already watched my tutorial on binance femix or by bit all those will be linked down below as well and available on my channel completely free we then click up here and we want to find the identifier for kusama which is ksm so then we simply type in up here ksm then ksm usdt that's the pairing we want and we can see here it's had a fairly we see lower highs right here we see lower lows as well so it's looking fairly bearish however when we pull up the charts in just a minute we could see or we might be able to see if there is an actual buying opportunity here so next we want to go over to trading view right now i've got the bitcoin price open as i'm filming this the price is 33 000 however we want we want to focus on the asset of choice right here which is ksm what you want to do is if you haven't already got yourself a trading view account as well you can go ahead and get one i believe i do have a link down below as well if you want to help out the channel but you can use it for free or if you wanted to use more indicators then you can go ahead and get yourself a pro account then we type in here ksmusdt like so ksmustt and it's on the binance exchange let's click that and take a look at the chart then the first thing that we're going to do once we open this chart is go to the four hour chart as that gives us a lot of information on our easy to manage time frame now this is where the interesting part comes in if you want to make a hundred dollars per day you have to be in and out of a trade within the time frame of one day of course it's a hundred dollars per day so the best way to do that i find is by using two different indicators the first one is the bollinger bands click on indicators and just simply type in bb click bulger bands like so and then close it this will bring up the bulger bands now maybe it's a little bit hard for you to see on the screen right now and so maybe i can edit this to make it a little bit more um [Music] easy to see like so like so i'll just make this the lines a little bit thicker so it's easier to see maybe i make them a little bit brighter as well so it's uh easier to in fact see if you're watching at home so first of all we have the bollinger bands that has now been brought up on screen and basically what these do it's a moving average and the price trades between them and this yellow line in the middle here is a medium and usually what people say is the price bounces from the lower to the higher and vice versa from the higher to the lower band and this is where a great trading opportunity can prevail itself however we don't want to use just one indicator we want to also bring up the rsi again click on indicators type in rsi relative strength index and that will bring this up usually the values on this um are between around 70 up here and 30 down here this is what they are preset to i'm going to change the rsi colors just so you can see them a lot easier at home like so okay now basically the the way that we can go ahead and trade something like this or look for potential trade opportunities is when the rsi is in fact below 30 so we are oversold which is down here below this white dotted line here and when the bullet the price the price candlesticks are touching the lower level of the bollinger band let's see for example um examples in the past we have right here first of all a the price is touching the lower level of the bollinger band b the rsi is outside of this lower level 30 so it's oversold this would indicate a great time to buy and we can see from looking back in history if we would have bought on this time maybe we couldn't get an exact entry point down there and we were sold when we hit the top bulger band we would have a profit of around 72 percent in just one day four hours now yes this is a completely um extraordinary example it's not going to happen like this usually you'd be looking for around two to five percent profit um maybe a little bit more if you wanted to be a bit more greedy per day to make of course not every day you're going to make this some days you may make 20 some days you may lose three or four percent but overall on an average that can turn out to 100 per day if you are trading with enough capital again let's look again right here we touch the lower level of the bollinger band however we weren't here on the rsi so i wouldn't have entered that point of course you could have entered and made a profit selling on the upper level of the bollinger band so we could have entered right here sold right here however that's only using one indicator of course you can still do it it's still profitable however using two indicators is a lot safer let's take a look at another example we can see right here this is a good example right here on the four hourly chart we touched the lower level of the bulger band right here and we and also we were outside so we can see right there and also right there this is an example a more realistic example and we can see we came up here and we touched the median also you can sell when you touch the median as well you don't have to wait until the upper level of the bollinger band because when they are stretched spread quite far apart like so it's going to be a little bit more difficult for them to actually go ahead and do that so you can either take 50 100 profit when you hit the median or you can take 50 and wait until we get to the other side in this example we would have seen around about a 15 profit which is definitely something really really nice just in the space of around eight hours so it's definitely within a day time frame so now let's talk and take a look at an example um in the current live market price right here we can see we touch the the lower level of the bollinger band and again right here we in fact touch the 30 rsi which will signal it's a great time to go ahead and enter if we would have entered um we would currently be up around eight percent in the space of around 16 hours so this is just another way which we can actually go ahead and make some nice profits while day trading if you wanted to take a look more on the swing trading side of things which means a trade um kind of in a longer term you can also do this on a longer term profile as well for example touching the lower level of the bollinger band here um and almost out or out which we can say right here however this um coin on the on the longer scale is going completely crazy since it's had such a large pump up recently uh it is dumping quite a bit so i'd recommend doing it on something a little more stable but definitely for short-term trades it's definitely interesting so um yeah that's basically that on the daily chart however back to the four-hourly chart the ways we can go ahead and make these 100 is simply by finding these different coins on coin market cap going ahead and executing small trades um aiming to be in and out within within the day this is definitely a viable method which we can go ahead and do all right guys thanks for watching today's video i really do appreciate it if you did get some value from it definitely drop a like on today's video and also don't forget to check out the bitcoin blueprint which is linked down below there it is a guide on how you can make money and

Capital you actually need in order to do this the seventh one of course is the most surprising and the best to do stick around to hear about that and of course these are not all like easy right in fact some of them are actually really risky literally you could lose all of your money so do keep that in mind and no not all of them are just set it and forget it passive income kind of stuff some of these actually require you to go out and do you know work put in time and effort with research and clicking buttons and stuff like that so keep that in mind we're gonna be starting here with the most Capital intensive options but also probably the safer options before we go and get into the YOLO options that can make you rich with as little as a thousand dollars or even starting from zero yes they exist to make sure to watch the video first let's talk about crypto bonds yes you can now buy US Treasury Bonds on the blockchain which is actually pretty cool companies like Ando Finance actually offer you the ability to move your stable coins into things like money market funds and U.S treasury bills at a 4.77 rate at the time recording this video that basically lets you buy what is considered by most to be one of the safest Assets in the world and to do it on chain so what's the risk rating here pretty low although do keep in mind that smart contracts can still be hacked these platforms are accessing these do have vulnerabilities so it's not as safe as buying via a brokerage account for example and what about the capital needed in order to make ten thousand dollars a month well you're gonna need about 2.5 million dollars for this one yeah everyone has that laying around right you got 2.5 million just sitting around the second method here staking ethereum recently staking rates went as high as 8.7 percent for ethereum although they have since cooled off to around five percent let's just say for the sake of our example rates will go back up we're gonna see lots of on-chain activity we're gonna have eight percent once again being the norm for ethereum mistaking well then in that situation you can make some sweet yields off a stake in your eat that eight percent of course is paid out in eth and not in dollars like the bond example that we just gave so it means that you can either sell your eth straight away for cash in order to realize those gains lock in the ROI or you can play the markets hold the eth and sell it at the next cycle obviously in hopes of doing that for more money that can easily amplify your gains potential here now I'll break down the math in a moment but first how risky is staking your ethereum well staking ethereum is pretty low risk by crypto standards however there are a few things to consider if you're using a staking provider do keep in mind that well they can get hacked that can happen even if it's unlikely it's also something to keep in mind that if you are self-staking well self-staking can actually result in losses too via things like slashing which can result in a big loss of funds so it's not super risk-free but low risk and what about Capital allocation well to earn ten thousand dollars a month at the current prices and assuming a higher staking rate than is currently available at 8.8 percent then you would need about 1 0.5 million dollars invested we're about 8 000 eighth which will earn you about 64 eth per year soon at higher staking right now if however the price of eath were to reach say ten thousand dollars per coin next Bull Run than the ROI on that staking would be more like 40 percent but even with such Moon math it would actually require about three hundred thousand dollars invested in order to get that 10K per month Target assuming you know you're cashing out later when the prices are higher still a lot of money by any standard number three low caps now this is not something that's easy to do at scale because liquidity is often very low on these but every month we see low cap coins put in massive gains coins like radiant Capital labor Finance you know it's funny I actually told my newsletter about radiant Capital before it pulled its massive run to like 10x in a few weeks but I actually myself failed to pull the trigger I kept saying to myself I'm gonna do it tomorrow I'm gonna do it tomorrow but then you know know tomorrow came the price went up my ego got in the way because I could have bought it yesterday for less and I couldn't bring myself to do it knowing that I could have bought it lower emotions messes up sometimes anyway somebody made money off it but it wasn't me so what about the risk rating well the risk rating here is high with low caps low caps have massive failure rates 90 plus fail they can literally go to zero overnight you'll also have to really put in the homework here a dozen new semi-serious looking projects launch every single day a few of those might actually be worth your money and of those few maybe one or two will put in some kind of big gains so if you want to find these you got to watch socials for early Whispers and what about the capital needed here well it's pretty low you can actually probably make ten thousand dollars a month flipping these small caps with just a thousand dollars as your starting Capital really the great part about low caps to be honest if you put in the effort then you can get rewarded for that and you can make some pretty nice returns however if you are trading with millions of dollars then low caps won't be worth your time since there won't be the liquidity to exit those positions so you gotta keep that in mind and that leads on to number four leverage trading a high liquidity high risk and high reward game this is basically trading on steroids it allows you to dramatically increase your gains by using leverage but it also introduces enhanced risk as well as the risk of liquidation which can wipe out your entire position but riding the waves of volatility in the market has indeed made many a Trader very very rich and with a bit of Leverage a 10 percent move on bitcoin can actually turn into what was just a really kind of boring move into 100 gains that's what 10x leverage does risk levels here I'm going to say medium to high high risk if you don't know what you're doing and medium risk if you do have some understanding of how to use leverage use low leverage and use a stop loss and manage your risk with position sizing all that kind of stuff use isolate margin Etc what about the capital needed to make ten thousand dollars a month well the sky is really lit but I would say at least ten thousand dollars maybe twenty or even thirty thousand dollars don't look for those hundred percent gain moves all of the time because it's easier to compound a few nice twenty Thirty forty percent moves into bigger gains over a time period by the way if you want to try your hand at leverage trading then I recommend doing it over on buy bit is the best place for trading Futures use the link down below to start your account and you'll get exclusive fee discounts deposit bonuses up to thirty thousand dollars and for a limited time a free one thousand dollar btcusdt trading position check it out now let's talk about number five meme coins we've heard all the stories about the early investors who bought Dogecoin you bought Shiba Inu they bought Pepe they made millions of dollars almost overnight those guys are the exception they're not the rule most people lose money on Meme coins but money can indeed be made in this super super volatile niche of the cryptocurrency market but how is it done well here is what successful meme coin Apes tend to do they spread lots of little bets around by 10 neem coins put 100 on each coin with the expectation of 90 rug pulls scams whatever and go to go to zero but hopefully one moons now let's talk risk this is super high risk and you will likely lose all of your money that you put into meme coins even if you do get a quote unquote winner then you still in almost every case need to Sell aggressively because 99 of mean coins even the ones the pump like crazy are gonna be worth zero within six months heck sometimes six days the window for profit can be very short Capital needed here very little this is the attraction of the meme coin game some guy put 200 bucks into Pepe he made Millions that's the dream right but if you want to win at the meme coin game you need to be careful to not be exit liquidity seriously Hustle Hard to Find new coins early get in those Discord groups get on the Reddit groups follow small accounts on Twitter stuff like this find that early stage Alpha Because by the time everyone is talking about a meme coin it's too late number six airdrops airdrop farming in particular the general laziness of people never ceases to amaze me sorry to say it guys but look there are regular air drops and test Nets out there were thousands of dollars that literally anyone can get if you just spend a few minutes to make a few button clicks it's absurdly easy you may not be able to consistently make ten thousand dollars a month farming air drops but the occasional big payday does come and you can actually make thousands of dollars per year maybe even tens of thousands of dollars per year there are people who are making tens of thousands sometimes even six figures per year farming air drops now I personally made five thousand dollars on the recent arbitrum airdrop this year and many newsletter subscribers also got a good payday from that we had so many tutorials and notices on how to be qualified for that anyway what about the risk well it's low very low in many cases since things like test Nets literally require zero money no money at all just a bit of your time occasionally airdrop requirements may say well you have to own a certain coin you have to stake a certain coin that can introduce more risk when you see those situations so keep that in mind Capital needed again most of the time it's either a free to use test net all you have to do is click the buttons and get the money or it's an airdrop for a coin you already hold by the way we share one promising air drop every week in the free wealth Mastery newsletter link below and number seven liquidity farming many a fortune has been made by being a liquidity provider into early protocols good protocols whatever it might be the idea is pretty simple you put coin a and coin B into some kind of liquidity pool on some kind of D5 platform and then you earn a portion of the fees from that Pool Plus often an extra token on top of that as some kind of added incentive now I have been doing this with a small position on Trader Joe recently and I made a thousand bucks in the last month doing that nice nice I'll take that that's great now be pretty easy to scale it up to ten thousand dollars a month per se with some additional Capital put in and some of the other pools on Trader Joe for example have very large Awards the Joe eath Pool right now is that 324 at a time that I recorded this which to be very clear comes solely from actual yield these massive returns they're not just all inflationary tokenomic stuff this actually comes from the high rate at which Traders are buying and selling Joe and eth right thus the liquidity providers into the pool are making big bucks right now because people are just paying truckloads of fees into that pool that's where the money comes from to pay these people now let's talk risks there are of course a lot of risks here rates change at 324 might be 50 a week and permanent loss is prevalent High rate high fee coins they can go to zero leaving the pools near zero your liquidity position near zero your loss near total smart contract tax happen again result in complete losses a lot can go wrong so be careful what about the capital needed well you can start with any amount of money of course but you want to get that magical ten thousand dollar a month number well you're probably in most cases gonna need a few hundred thousand dollars sorry but higher risk pools can make you like ten thousand dollars a month with as little as forty or fifty thousand dollars again adjusting for risk here because he might lose it all okay that's it subscribe now I'll see you next time thank you [Music]

about to default on its debt lots to cover here but first please like And subscribe check us down below for our CT Club where you get our trade alerts portfolio updates you get to see what we are buying during this accumulation phase and boy we are setting ourselves up for a really great bull market okay let's let's go to this article really quick significant risk of U.S treasury running out of funds soon really so according to a May 12th report published by the U.S congressional budget office CBO the risk of U.S government defaulting on its debt in the near term stems from reaching its statutory debt of 31.4 trillion dollars on January 19th the CBO predicts that the debt limit remains unchanged um the US government could be in hot water uh as early as June now my thoughts on this is first off the US will never default on its debt they're going to print their way out if you know anything about history just go back uh countries don't essentially default on their debt they try to inflate their way out and this is what the us is going to do they're going to inflate inflate inflate so that two percent uh inflation Target that Yellen was talking about yeah good luck that's never going to happen for your entire life all right just know that their debt is going to increase and inflation is going to Skyrocket all right so let's move on to this now speaking about like the dangers of what is happening to the US dollar there's some really big risks here first off my opinion before we get into this all central banks are in collusion with each other that's just my own opinion um I think that they are just playing games with the entire world all right so let's get into this bricks in other countries to align uh against US dollar is now um irrevocable um so let's get into this this is from the daily huddle so it says so when the dollar gets higher because Powell is raising rates which they have been for a while barely raising rates uh that becomes more onerous and painful for the rest of the world as they begin to break ranks Asia in general China and Russia in particular are very rank breaking Nations and of course they're bringing 41 countries alongside to have trade settlements outside of the US dollar so it's a big deal you know um other countries are definitely looking forward to getting rid of the US dollar I don't blame them I wish them all the best but then again you know this is all going to curtail to what's going to happen in the future with the special type of currency I cannot say it on this channel because I will get Shadow banned I've been diminishing in numbers on YouTube so yeah they hate what I'm talking about but just letting you know that uh this is going to get much worse and more and more countries are going to go against the US dollar um simply because it's going to be more of a country-to-country basis in terms of a new currency that's going to be happening pretty soon all right so let's go on to tether so who's tether is actually buying up a ton of Bitcoin actually they've been bought they've bought up in in q1 they bought around 52 670 Bitcoin 52 000. in q1 so but uh now by the end of 2023 they were they will uh probably outpace microstrategies if they're doing the same amount over and over again with 200 000 coins per year so yeah microstrategy definitely has a competitor if microstrategy is trying to be the number one holder of Bitcoin well Heather is potentially going to print their way to that uh it's gonna be really interesting to find out what happens with that uh you know what I don't really care too much but um what I do care about is that Bitcoin is going to be around for a lot longer than microstrategy than binance then tether and all these other things okay because I've been in this space much much longer than any of these entities were in this space okay and the reason why I got in this space because I saw potential in 21 million of a non-elastic supply asset like Bitcoin that is like what else do you want and it's decentralized and open source and permissionless so yeah you know whatever happens I'm not worried about it um yeah this could be a good pop you know it definitely like that could uh I've been in a couple of groups uh chat groups and they're saying hey maybe this is uh where you know Bitcoin essentially pops when it gets too high or whatever it say if we reach 150 200 000 this bull market that could be the thing that pops it uh who knows I don't care it doesn't matter I'm still gonna hold my Bitcoin anyways let's move over to Jameson Lop all right he is a great person to fall on Twitter uh he says two 28 million Bitcoin addresses contain at least ten dollars worth of satoshi's each Bitcoin holder likely has several if not many addresses it's unlikely that more than 10 million people truly own any Bitcoin and to to uh tell you how small of a number that is so Bitcoin uh adoption Global adoption is at 0.125 so we are really early in this game right if you're just getting into Bitcoin right now you're still very very early in my my opinion and that is why I'm still here and I'm not gonna quit lastly kind of funny if you like Twitter well there's some drama right happening right now CZ binance just unfollowed Elon Musk yes kids will be kids whatever it doesn't matter anyways I hope you have a great day talk to you soon bye

money but the beautiful part about cryptocurrency trading is that you really don't need that much Capital at all to be able to grow a small account and create a massive income machine for yourself if you know how to do it properly so today in this video I'm going to use my seven years experience as a full-time day trader and I'm going to show you exactly how I would take a hundred dollar account and grow it into a ten thousand dollar account okay I'm going to show you how to get access to Capital I'm going to show you the exact strategy that I would use to safely grow your account okay I'm going to show you a system that you can start using today to actually take these trades and I'm going to show you case studies of the trades that I take with my core team of traders to be able to make three to five thousand dollars per week trade in cryptocurrency so if that sounds good to you and that's your goal make sure you hit the like button on this video subscribe to the channel if you like trading and investing check us out on Discord and on Instagram okay we have a whole amazing trading community so the biggest barrier to entry for most people starting their trading journey is the amount of money that they have in their account okay so I'm to show you right now how you can take a hundred dollar account and be able to use ten thousand dollars worth of capital to safely take these trades I'm partnered up with buy bitbive it's probably the best cryptocurrency trading exchange out there that's why we partnered with them okay they offer us up to 125 x leverage on some pairs you can see right here on certain pairs we only go up to about 50. this is probably the single most important thing to understand when you're getting into trading without this you're going to lose money I promise you so just make sure you pay attention to this part right here okay so for example with my trades I'm risking 500 per trade in attempts to make anywhere from fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars per trade but say we're working with a hundred dollar account okay that means at ten percent we're risking ten dollars per trade but now we need to figure out how many coins we need to buy in order to only risk ten dollars okay so leaving systems aside for a second let's say we wanted to buy apecoin at this level put our stop loss down at this level meaning that if we're wrong and it continues moving down we're selling our position and that we want to take profit at this level what we want to do is find the difference between these values and that's going to give us .057 then we're going to take the dollar amount risk we want to risk per trade which in this case is ten dollars and we're going to divide it by the difference between the entry and the stop okay and that's going to give us the amount of tokens that we need to buy in order to risk only ten dollars okay if we're just going in with 250 coins or a thousand coins we're never going to be able to dial in our risk reward and you're going to absolutely screw yourself so make sure that you're not doing that you need to have that set dollar amount okay so that means that in order to find the capital requirement or the amount of money that we need for this trade we have to take the amount of coins and multiply it by the entry price which is this level here okay so in this case we're going to take 175 coins multiplied by 3.35 and that's going to give us 587 dollars then we need to be able to get into this position when we're using leverage the only thing it's changing is how much money we personally need to put into the trade so if I have a hundred dollar account and I use a 100x leverage that means now I have ten thousand dollars to use okay because if we only had a hundred dollar account okay this 587 is already 5x the size of our cash value of our account which makes it impossible okay so let's go over to buy bit here let's say we want to take this ape trade here okay we need 175 coins we can see right here our Capital requirement for this position is 586 dollars now watch what happens when we open up our leverage okay and you're gonna get this warning that the liquidation is high okay as long as you're quantifying you're entering your exit and you're risking that ten dollars you are safe and you're doing the right thing okay so now only thing that we need to use for this position is twelve dollars which is 12 of our entire account okay so this leverage capability is changing nothing about the risk profile on the trade okay if you plan on trading anyways use the referral Link in the description okay each week we do a giveaway where anyone trading with 50k volume or higher is going to be automatically entered to win a hundred dollars per week we're picking three winners a week okay we're trying to give the fees that we're collecting from the affiliate program back into the community for you guys trading with us link is below you can check out our Discord where we announce the winners okay before we hop into the trading system that you can use to start taking these trades I want to go over the rules that I would recommend using when growing a small account okay so the first rule is start with the dollar amount risk per trade 10 of starting balance on a hundred dollar account use that ten dollar risk okay each time you double the account so when you go to 100 up to 200 okay you want to move that up to the 10 of the 200 moving it to the 20 per trade threshold get comfortable with the dollar amount and use that there until we scale our account up a little bit larger the third thing and this is super important is everyone has a psychological threshold when it comes to how much money they're comfortable risking if I'm looking at losing 500 like this 500 500 where I lose three trades in a row I don't care who you are or what the math says you're going to start feeling a little bit emotional about the trades and that's something that you really want to avoid until you come comfortable doing that okay so say you work your way up to 200 to 500 to a thousand okay and then ten percent of a thousand is a hundred dollars per trade and that's too much for you okay you can walk that back down to fifty dollars per trade pick that fixed amount once you want to preserve your capital and just pick a goal per day on the money that you want to make once you get up to a comfortable threshold where it's fitting your income goals so for me personally you know I like to make three that three to five thousand dollars per week so I'm using you know about 2.5 percent of my entire account balance right around twenty thousand dollars that I keep in my account and then I'll increase it you know a couple years from now move up to a thousand try to make three to five thousand per trade and try to double my income okay so let's get into the bread and butter of the actual trading this is a system that I've been trading the markets with for the past couple months that have absolutely been nailing trades with I'm gonna show you one of the setups that I had on xrp when I was actually in Dubai okay but what I want to do is find an area where I have a newly established uptrend first thing that I want to do is identify my wave count okay so if this is our beginning wave one first pullback is two largest waves up to three pullback is four and then the high is five and the way we can try to find the top of five is by using a Fibonacci projection off of our one wave so if this is our one value I'm gonna click here click back here and then find my factor of one and you can see the price action sort of Consolidated right along this level if we take a Fibonacci retracement off of this level and go up to the high of one if our price action comes down through the 61.8 or lower we're going to want to Target the 261.8 range okay and you can see right here we got three four reacted five came up and then we got our consolidation in here okay so the next thing that I want to do is once I've confirmed that my wave 5 is here and we get a pullback to this region is I wanted to click a trend off of the high of three right here down to the low of a this is going to Give Me A Channel Of price action to follow okay then I'm just going to clone this up by right clicking on it put this at the high of five right here and I click at my high of five down to the low of a and then I'm going to set my entry to you get short a lot of people don't know that you can take the short side of markets but basically I want the price to go down and that's going to allow me to make money as well okay so if I want to get short in on the 61.8 level here I'm going to put my stop loss to get out of the position just over my five here and this profit Target is going to be to be determined for the moment okay so if I play this forward price action comes up gets me filled in this level so now I'm short okay and the way you do this on buy bit okay see this sell short button that we have this instance we wanted to get short at 41 cents okay so the next thing that I'm going to do is find my position size okay so I'm going to take 0.411 subtract that by my stop loss value at 0.4203 that's going to give me this value take my 10 risk and then divide it by that value to get my unit amount for a ten dollar risk on this trade okay so that means I need a thousand xrp tokens with my 10x leverage it's gonna cost me 37 I can crank this up to 50 hit confirm okay so now you can see my Capital requirement for this trade is going to be eight dollars and I put my stop loss at that point four two level and then I would just hit open short position and that's going to make it so that when this price trades back down to this level or wherever my profit Target is I'm going to make money on the position going down okay you can trade both sides of this Market this system works in both directions okay so if I play this forward you can see price comes down once you see the a level break or at least touch like that so we have price moving down boom we have a break we can start setting our profit Target and the way we do that is we go over here we go into our Trend based FIB extension I'm going to click at the high of B down to the low of a and then back up to this level here okay so what I want to do is drive Fibonacci off of this overall trend up to my high here and you can see here's where my 61.8 is and see how this is matching up perfectly with the 2618 projection off of our a b that's going to give us our projection for c for a profit Target okay and I did this in real time in my Vlog so I'm not just looking after the fact and knowing that it happened I literally showed it in real time because this stuff always works Fibonacci is the answer to life it's the Key of Life okay so make sure that you learn Fibonacci if you learn nothing else from this okay so you can see price is trading forward comes back retests our Trend a bit and then overnight we get a massive dump off in price low is broken see where this bottom forms right here and then we get our exact profit Target hit okay and then this ends up trading back up and coming up higher okay so you can see how if you're only risking ten dollars on this you would have already made forty one dollars in profit on this trade you can see by that ratio right in that box right there so even if you're wrong like more than half of the time okay if you're making a one to four risk reward you're gonna break even being right twenty percent of the time okay if you're right 30 of the time you're profitable forty percent fifty percent and so on you can use this table with your trades to figure out how much money you're going to make over time with your system okay so you really don't need to worry about always being right you just need to make sure that you're setting up these trades properly and in conjunction with the proper sizing and the rules that I set up there's no reason why you can't take a hundred dollar account and trade that up to a thousand five thousand ten thousand and continue growing till you get to that comfortable range okay and if we look one of our students recently was able to take our training take all the things that we're basically talking about in this video right here was able to lock in twenty six hundred dollars on his first trade okay and then he was closing out all sorts of crazy profits and you can see he did give us a little bit of shout out there which is amazing people here know what they're doing bought the course seven days ago and is already making crazy Bank like this so there's a lot of misinformation there's a lot of people who don't know what they're doing these are the types of things that you need to learn and this is how you're going to scale your account up and that being said if you made it to this period in the video it means you're very committed if you've been following our Channel you know we have a little joke going on with Pellegrino because I tried to partner with Lacroix they didn't let me and now you know I started plugging Pellegrino because I love Pellegrino if you comment Pellegrino in the description I'm going to be giving to two people full access to our entire Suite of training which is valued at right around a thousand dollars all you have to do is comment Pellegrino something that you liked about the video join our Discord and in about a week or two I'm going to be announcing two winners also I don't have a paid partnership with them but kind of a running joke that I'm trying to get one so we'll see what happens but anyways guys I hope this video was helpful for you if you're still here make sure you hit the like button make sure you subscribe to the channel if you like trading and investing and you appreciated this but until next time guys I will see you all in the next video foreign

youtu.be/WLckSKzFpE8",4093.0,72141,760,is the king of bitcoiners a fraud is the SEC going to label everything a security and why are nfts dumping like crazy is this a buying opportunity if you're interested in all of these topics keep watching and if you enjoy these updates hit the like button and hit subscribe because we put out videos every single day this is crypto tips my name is Heidi you might also know my husband Toby who also contributes to this channel as well we do daily videos and if you want to know what we're doing with our cryptocurrencies and why if you want to know nfts that we're holding if you want to know when we're taking profits which all coins we are accumulating now in preparation for the next Bull Run you gotta check out our CT Club where we let you know what we are doing with our cryptocurrencies and why a link for that is down below in the video description so first of all there's a lot of talk about how now the US is not discussing any outright bands of cryptocurrency but what they are discussing according to Janet Yellen are strict regulations a rigid framework of regulations for cryptocurrencies they want to know who's buying crypto why what you plan to do with it where you're sending it and they're going to go ahead and tell you which ones you will and will not be able to gain exposure to unless you know how to use a decentralized exchange and you use a wallet that you yourself control by having access to something called a private key if you want to know what I'm talking about check out the links for all the videos Down Below in the video description they're there to try to help you gain more understanding of how to take real control over your cryptocurrencies if you're a US citizen I think that's going to be increasingly more important if you want to participate in this cryptocurrency market as freely as you would like to so they're not talking about an outright ban of crypto but probably this this regulatory framework this rigid regulatory framework framework that they're talking about they might as well ban it because what I just said it's going to be suffocating especially for anyone who's trying to build a cryptocurrency focused business in the US I think those are those days are long gone I think there are far greener pastures and I know Toby again agrees with me the innovation of crypto is not going to be found in the US and in addition to this the SEC Gary ginsler our favorite guy our favorite regulator who likes to not actually protect as investors but actually just you know try to get as many paychecks as he can from legitimate cryptocurrency projects uh he is again saying anything that isn't Bitcoin is a security or will be a security showing time and again how much he doesn't understand about cryptocurrencies because there's quite a few cryptocurrencies that do not pass the Howie test which is the only thing that he has working for him which is a a basically a test that was developed over what 80 years ago like so long ago uh that cryptocurrency does not fit into that box however he wants he wants it to uh and so anyway Michael Sayler the new savior of Bitcoin they never last too long you know the guys who are championing Bitcoin the guys who are always looking for the spotlight of cryptocurrencies they all fall under their own weight and ego and Michael Saylor I believe is another one of those guys and when he makes statements like this I'm going to provide a link to the Tweet Down Below in the video description he's saying basically consensus is being built that every crypto besides Bitcoin will be a security that makes Bitcoin the only cryptocurrency workable as a a global crypto payment solution because he thinks that the U.S is the only country in the world what a fraud what have bitcoiners turn into I totally agree with it there's a lot of comments interesting replies to his tweet and I totally agree with that sentiment is that crypto is reliant on the US I do not think so and I think in the next five ten years when Innovation leaves and those fruits start becoming apparent internationally not in the U.S I think the us is going to change it soon real quick and Michael Saylor is going to be awfully disappointed that his number one country the US is actually a succubus it's a Cancer and his government is bleeding its citizens dry of their exposure to Freedom like cryptocurrency offers also there's a lot of speculation lately about nfts and that definitely I believe ties into this whole Narrative of what's happening with the SEC and the U.S saying they're not Banning crypto but they will be enforcing very tight regulations nfts according to Gary Gensler are securities and perhaps this whale that has been dumping hundreds of nfts at not much of a profit I think they're doing doing so because they're scared of what they could be liable for there might be a U.S citizen might be tied to some other centralized entities and they're trying to cut their losses now or maybe take profits what they think can just because you're a whale and you made some success success sometime doesn't mean that you can call it every single time whales happen every day where they sell and they regret it and this could very well be the case nfts classically output have actually outperformed the last bull market they've been they've done quite well in this bear Market as well uh board Apes have like 93 of board ape Yacht Club nfts have not been traded at all in this year mutinates also over 90 percent uh what other ones Moon Birds Oddities a lot of a lot of popular nfts are being held long term and that it's adding even more to their scarcity this is not investment advice it is something that Toby and I are going more and more into and exploring the options for what nfts can grant in fact we just made a post today so for those of you who are in the CT Club be sure to check your email be sure to check out our CT Club post for those of you who want to know what we've been up to you got to check out the CT Club a link for it is down below in the video description thank you so much for tuning in if you guys enjoyed hit like And subscribe see

what the heck is going on with the Ledger and their newest firmware update soon to come uh what does this mean for all ledger users what does this mean for the security of Hardware wallets in general I have a lot of thoughts about this but I'm going to talk about basically the update who it affects uh steps moving forward what to be aware of and my opinions welcome to crypto tips today is not my favorite most favorite at all video to make but probably a very very I mean I know this to be a very important video to to be publishing out so thank you everyone for tuning in and for being aware of what's happening with self-custody and with the largest Hardware wallet company uh that should be at the Forefront of this so right off the bat Ledger is rolling out a new recover tool service basically this is like the number one fear of new people coming into cryptocurrencies is that um what if I lose my private key what if I lose all my crypto where is the help desk that will help me get it back and Ledger trying to appeal to the masses the people who don't know any better the people who don't understand the importance of self self-custody they're trying to appeal to them by unleashing this new tool that requires things like uh kyc which is identifying proving your identity over the owner of private Keys um and also you know not just that but also like having a video uh FaceTime probably type of experience to prove your identity and what this process means is basically you have your Ledger you have your seed phrase that you've generated and let's say you're a crypto newbie and you want to have help you want to have a backup plan in case you lose that what you're going to do is you're going to having had this firmware update and if you're buying a new Ledger this might already automatically be installed on your device especially if you're buying a ledger Nano X which currently is the only Nano device available for this firmware update where you will if you want to do this service it's an additional 9.99 9.99 a month for this service and and what you're going to do is on your device and on your Ledger live you're going to say that you want to do the service you want to opt into this and you will confirm this on your device and they're saying that's going to create the ability for your device to generate a backup of your recovery phrase it will encrypt that recover that backup that additional backup in a certain way that will basically encrypt it will it will turn your Ledger into a multi-sig type wallet where three out of the two signatures will be required to regain access to your coins if you were to lose them the three entities being Ledger coin cover and a third company that they are not publicly announcing on their website at least I'm not sure if they said this in their announcement on Twitter I think I've read somewhere on Twitter uh someone found what that third company is but the fact that it's just two out of the three that they're being public about is enough to raise some suspicions you get let's say you lost your recovery phrase and so you go to Ledger you say okay I need to enact this uh assisted backup and Ledger and coin cover or the other company can come forward and combine these fractions uh and encrypted forms of your backup together to give your coins back here is where a lot of skepticism concerns and fear is coming from Ledger users people who have always been vocal against Ledger especially are being very loud but here's my point is that even as someone who's a Die Hard Ledger fan we should always be skeptical about anything that we cannot verify and Ledger has been great it's a hardware wallet that I've supported for years I've talked about it I've suggested it as an option for people to use as their Hardware wallet device to secure their cryptocurrencies because I've used Ledger it's a first and basically only Hardware wallet that I use most often in fact that might be changing very soon uh unfortunately but we always have to stay on our toes right and being skeptical is what will keep us and our cryptocurrency is secure in a Southern self-custody fashion so again a quick recap this is for if for those of you who are already Ledger users this is going to roll out in the newest firmware update so if you don't want anything to do with this don't update your Ledger firmware additionally this is only going to be allowed right now for The Ledger Nano X version or device soon to be The Ledger Nano S Plus and The Ledger Stacks but it will not be able to be applied to The Ledger Nano s so for those of you who are still holding on to that that OG Ledger device you might be in the clear although I know that those devices are pretty old by now and maybe a little bit dilapidated so I think if you are a user of a ledger Ledger Nano s count yourself lucky at this point because right now we don't know the new attack vectors that this is going to unleash for Ledger users I'm not I'm trying my best not to instill on any kind of fud or Panic I'm just trying to keep you guys updated so that you can make an educated decision on where you're going to hold your cryptos now this whole ability of this is where the controversy comes from with Ledger is because Ledger software is completely open source everything about Ledger is open source except their secure element which is a little physical chip that they have in their Hardware wallet devices this is closed source so because of that there's always been a requirement or a level of trust with Ledger Hardware wallets now for me my own peace of mind with Ledger has always been in the fact that they've been around since 2014 and have never suffered a hack from their Hardware wallet devices their devices have never been hacked and so for me that is still a positive in that there's now these accusations that this secure element maybe has always had a back door or at the very least this firmware will allow it to have a back door because there's these concerns where this recovery system service will allow your chip in your device to not only generate your seed phrase which is what it normally does but also to export that seed phrase to these other third parties that is the huge concern that's because that's something that ledger time and again and in fact in in their announcement on Twitter about this new Recovery Service they've said about three or four times the CTO so said that the secure element chip or this the chip does not have access to your recovery phrase it cannot send your recovery phrase elsewhere it begs the question well then how are these fragmented uh private Keys essentially being sent to these third parties is it from the chip or is it the user that has to physically send this private key basically to these third parties either way this is where my disappointment comes in because in my opinion Ledger is and has been maybe that's changing right now in my opinion a Cornerstone of self-custody and cryptocurrency and a company that helps people take real true ownership over their cryptocurrency and should be at the Forefront of that type of education now they're going soft in my opinion very very soft and at the end of this video I'm going to explain why that might be happening with some recent regular patients coming out of Europe but now they're saying you know what we need to be more marketable to the masses we need to appeal to the masses so now what we're seeing is one of the the greatest crypto companies in my opinion are are succumbing to the pressures of the masses instead of trying to encourage these people to rise up to this ability to self-custody their cryptocurrencies instead of you know they're not trying to now educate people on the importance of self-custody they're saying you know what I know it's really hard why don't you um trust third parties who you don't know personally and who can very easily be changed in the future if these companies were to go out of business if these companies were to suffer data breaches themselves these companies not to mention this whole multi-sig recovery service requires two out of three to come together to sign to re uh to gain access to your coins that's a pretty small number for for multi-sig not to mention the fact that they are now publicly announced for the world to know for governments to know for hackers to know if they wanted to Target or put pressure on these companies to Fork over information for the sake of let's say National Security or whatever reason they might want to portray to gain instant access to the fact that not only you own crypto but this is your private key and they have your name full kyc information a video of your face basically saying yes this is really me this is really my cryptocurrencies there's a whole lot of conflict of interest here that I am really turned off by and I am not alone and I have to apologize if this does end up being the worst case scenario for Ledger then you know I've only done as much as I can based on what I've known about this company and it was always in a good faith basically and always in an effort to help you self-custody so if Ledger isn't the end-all be-all which it never really was but it was a great it is maybe it was I don't know my tenses are going to be mixed up here a little bit um one of the best hardware wallets especially for things like decentralized exchanges and D5 it had a ton of uh interoperability and Integrations on a lot of innovative new cryptocurrency platforms so you know what the next best option is and maybe the first best option right now is trezor I think that treasure is going to be probably inundated with orders at this point because trezor is 100 open source there are pros and cons to this now the pros of Ledger having the secure element being closed source is that it's never been hacked treasure several years back um during a hackathon basically was uh found out to have a type of vulnerability where if your treasure is in the hands of someone who has a very specialized type of computer for let's say 15 minutes and they have your treasure device they do not have your private key they do not have your password they could basically Brute Force into your treasure device so there is trezor isn't uh the end all be all Hardware wallet but in my opinion it still is very very good and secure option because especially if you're able to secure your actual device in a very uh good way that keeps it out of the hands of someone who might have a super powerful capable computer able to uh to make that hack happen I think trezor is an excellent resource also cold card is another one that's been uh you know talked about is I think it's specifically for Bitcoin most most other Hardware wallets are specific for Bitcoin and don't have so much interoperability with things like D5 staking decentralized exchanges before I go into all of that maybe that will be the next video or a video in the future of next steps and Best Hardware wallets that are an option for you guys I've done tutorials on trezor in the past if you guys want to check that one out there's also a link for you can just go to treasure.io and order your own Hardware wallet there I have an affiliate link down below if you want to help support this Channel with trezor I'm really trying to keep an even mind here in that we don't know everything maybe this announcement from Ledger wasn't as best planned as it could have been I don't think they shed a lot of info information especially considering the fact that most of Ledger users are pretty intelligent in terms and literate in terms of cryptocurrencies and so they can see these huge red flags for what they are is ledger sacrificing their old customer base in favor of trying to be marketable for the millions and hundreds of millions of masses that they're trying that they're kind of slobbering uh you know after to get in in their market share so anyway we're still figuring out the best case scenario we're trying to get as much information as we can and I'm sure I'm going to be making several updated videos for this we haven't heard a whole lot from Ledger themselves in regards to this backlash there now what I mentioned earlier in today's video is uh could this be that ledger is being pressured by Regulators by governments around the world to the need to identify who owns Which cryptocurrency wallets that has a lot to do with the new Mica regulations coming out of your Europe that will be tomorrow's video so if you guys want to learn more about those crazy new regulations and my thoughts and if they're actually going to be able to be enforced and what that means for crypto users in Europe go ahead and hit subscribe because that video is coming out tomorrow you don't want to miss it if you guys appreciated this update I know it's not good news but it's much more important in my opinion to keep you guys updated rather than make you you know feel super good about yourself all the time I think it's much more important to be educated and furthermore I just want to end this video with the always the reminder that you guys are absolutely capable of self-custody that is where we should be elevating ourselves and our expectation because coddling new cryptocurrency users is a disservice to those users and to the cryptocurrency industry as a whole let's be better let's do better let's self custody and do so in a safe manner is ledger still that option I don't know yet I'll keep you posted anyway thank you guys for watching I'll see you tomorrow

these strategies I'm gonna show you to do so it's very important first of all that you know that this video is not a financial advice it's all about just providing some strategies that I'm using and it's up to you if you want to use them or not to get started you need to deposit funds either in the form of Fiat or crypto over to buy bit for this you can click my link in the description to buy bits if you click my link you can get actually up to 30 thousand dollars in deposit bonus now that you have a buy bit account and that you have up to thirty thousand dollars in bonus there so let's get straight into how to identify a coin or token to trade so in part one I talked about um how you can trade ethereum but today I'm gonna show the Bitcoin chart but this doesn't mean that you cannot use other altcoins personally I'm gonna use coin market cap today because it allows us to check many different cryptocurrencies and analyze them and also sort them by the highest gains and losses in the past 24 hours to see which tokens are trending you can even search new tokens for a category we can consider using this method for checking an altcoin trending tokens are always good so right now there's a lot of uh trending AI tokens crypto games trading there are E5 metaverse you have so many different trending coins and tokens and I would suggest trying to go with those and of course meme coins is the latest big thing people are talking about would be great to trade for sure so after selecting your altcoin or Bitcoin it's time to show you this part number two here so you need trading patterns to identify them in the charts to trade them now to trade up to 100 per day you need trading view I do have a link down below to trading view if you want to use it personally I'm using the pro version but it is completely free if you want to use it and as I mentioned earlier I have selected Bitcoin however you may choose any other token that you prefer it is essential to keep in mind that besides Bitcoin all other altcoins are even more volatile which indicates that while there is potential for more profit there is also the risk of bigger losses very important so it is very crucial to use risk management and whenever we do trading we have to make sure that we don't use too much leverage never more than 20x in my opinion so we have to create a market order you choose your leverage and then you determine whether you prefer a limit order or a market order then you choose the amount of usdt you wish to allocate towards opening this trade click on either long or short depending on the trading pattern and then that's done as I said in this video I'm going to use Bitcoin against USD pair and I will use trading view website to explain to you some of these patterns and as I said earlier I'm using buy bit but you can also use bitflix actually with bitflix you can get 50 sign up and deposit bonus if you deposit 100 so go below this video and try bitflix if you haven't tried it already it's a great alternative to buy bits bitflix buy bit binance okx there are so many exchanges out there they all do pretty much the same thing but I choose buy bit for this video so let's talk about the bull flag Bear Flag a great way to make you 100 per day is the Bull and Bear Flags let's start with the bull flag one of my favorite patterns because it's very easy to trade the bull flag pattern consists of two main components a flagpole and a flag the flagpole is an initial sharp and strong upward moving price often characterized by high trading volume it represents a period of intense buying pressure and indicates a significant surge in demand on the other side the flag starts to be created after the flagpole where a period of consolidation follows the uptrend where the price retraces in a relatively structured and restricted range these consolidation forms a rectangular shape that we call the flag the Flag represents a temporary pause or a period of profit taking after the initial price surge as you can see here in the Bitcoin chart this bull flag has this descending parallel lines indicating a relatively stable range of prices this one is the support and this one is the resistance and it should not slope downwards or exhibit significantly volatility usually the price stays between this support and resistance lines during the flag formation the trend of the volume usually goes down when volume goes down that's usually a great sign that a huge breakout is coming so how do we trade this how do we measure the target as as I said earlier a bull flag is followed by an uptrend so to measure the target you can use a line here you take the pole you put it up like this and then you get the potential Target remember when we trade this type of pattern we should take profit before we hit the target because as you know the crypto Market is volatile sometimes things change fast so take profit slightly before the target but when do we enter the trade you should start the trade when the pattern concludes with a breakout to the upside where the price breaks the resistance line of the flag this breakout is often accompanied by an increase in trading volume and signals resumption of the initial uptrend you should use this breakout as a Buy Signal to enter a long position and if you add leverage to your position you can profit even more but it's also important to use a stop loss and take profit you can place a take profit before the target like I mentioned earlier and your stop loss should be in the strong support Zone under the support line like this the second pattern you can use is a bear flag and in fact everything is the exact same instead of longing you can short A Bear Flag so it's really the same no need to go through the same thing again the target is the exact same as you can see I take the line I put it down and the target is same and also how to enter the trade is actually the exact same as well the next pattern you can trade is the symmetrical triangle here we can clearly see a symmetrical triangle we just need to connect all these descending resistance points and all the ascending support points and there is a symmetrical triangle here now this can be a bullish or bearish pattern and to measure the target of a symmetrical triangle you need to measure between the support and resistance of the symmetrical triangle and from the breakout this should take you to the Target perfectly either to the up or down side now where's your entry the entry is at the very end of the symmetrical triangle when you see a candle breaking the resistance or support if it breaks the descending resistance line it's time to open a long position if it breaks the support line however it's a time for a short position our last pattern is the ascending wedge before I dive into the important part of this segment make sure to go and watch part number one of this how to make a hundred dollars per day by trading that video is very very important and also very important is to sign up to buy a bit or bitflix with buy bit you can get 30 000 bonus if you deposit some crypto with bitflix you can get fifty dollars if you deposit only a hundred dollars so for all of you whales out there keep trading on buy but if you are smaller you can definitely go to bitflix with just a small 100 deposit to get your fifty dollars so yeah links down below so an ascending wedge is a technical pattern often observed in crypto trading charts it is a bearish reversal pattern and indicates a potential Trend reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend the pattern is formed by two converging trend lines with the lower trend line acting and support and the upper trend line acting as resistance both going to the upside as you can see right here usually there's a significant uptrend in the price of the cryptocurrency before the ascending wedge formation then the lower trend line connects the price lows acting at support level while the upper trend line connects to price highs acting as the resistance level to measure the target you just take the height of the pattern like this and then put it like that and then you want to know where to enter the trade eventually the price of the crypto typically breaks out of the ascending wedge pattern the breakout could be bearish and could be bullish obviously if you break the resistance here you want to put in Long position if we break the support here you want to put in a short position it is very important to know everything about patterns if you want to make a hundred dollars per day if you really want to make a hundred dollars per day then for sure subscribe to my YouTube channel follow my daily videos because in my daily videos I make technical analysis on bitcoin ethereum meme coins and D5 coins crypto gaming coins because there I show you this strategy in practice how to actually put these trades in real time so make sure to subscribe

you guys remember when Bitcoin Unleashed Tap Root upgrade and that enabled smart contracts on the Bitcoin Network and then remember when they created ordinals which are also kind of like nfts on the Bitcoin Network and uh basically with Taproot it allowed and the smart contract implementation it allowed for arbitrary data like photos and videos additionally to be stored within the blocks of a Bitcoin blockchain and so that led to basically half a million transactions having to wait to be confirmed on the blockchain at the time of this recording that number is down about half to be about 200 give or take a thousand transactions still waiting in the mempool to be confirmed on the Bitcoin blockchain it's not clear if like if it's only these nft type transactions that are the ones waiting or if it's just people who haven't bumped up their transaction fees that are waiting uh personally I've done many Bitcoin transactions that took basically the same amount of time as usual about 10 minutes give or take now I did a video about this and uh what it means for the future of Bitcoin is it going to be changing from like the tried and true simple uh foundational thing of just pure peer-to-peer transactions on an immutable Ledger is it now doing fancy things like nfts and smart contracts and how does that affect how Bitcoin is is used and who uses Bitcoin there's a lot of people who are maximalists who are Bitcoin purists as of being a Bitcoin maximalist isn't enough there's Bitcoin Maximus and then there's the purest of the Bitcoins crowd and they think Bitcoin should just be pure and simple stick to what it does best being simple and robust in that um there's other people who think you know this uh ordinals and these smart contracts on bitcoin is going to open up the door for different types of users to be actually be interacting with a Bitcoin Point network if that means that transactions are going to be slower or more expensive is yet another incentive to work on layer twos they do have lightning network but there's probably going to be much more because now there's actually a use case for a layer 2 on bitcoin because believe it or not there's been some two vocal Bitcoin devs who have been trying to cancel ordinals trying to cancel the ability to create nfts and have these smart contracts on bitcoin basically so at first glance wow that's kind of uh alarming as these two people are especially if you read how they're talking they seem to be speaking with a lot of authority and to be like representative of the whole Bitcoin development community and as the days have gone on we've seen some obviously uh some other people being quite vocal saying that they don't represent the whole Bitcoin Community but here's what these two devs are saying basically we can address this and undo it and act like it's a bug fix making an overall update to the network it's a very official update compared to something like a VIP or a Bitcoin Improvement proposal which that actually gets voted on by the node operators to actually implement it or not this is a great reminder of the type of governance happening on bitcoin it is all on-chain governance if you guys are worried about how Bitcoin develops and if you don't have a say on what kind of upgrades happen on bitcoin well if you want to say you have to run your own node your node is a computer that Taps into the Bitcoin Network and you are either a lot you're either running the updates or choosing not to update and not to Signal towards any updates so uh it's there for you it's why Bitcoin is called peer-to-peer it's why it's called permissionless you don't have to ask permission to run a node you are going to need an awful lot of storage and computing power because it's going to have to be running 24 hours a day to keep up with the growing blockchain but it is certainly possible and that's how the Bitcoin network runs fortunately I travel too much to actually facilitate and make it feasible to run a node myself otherwise I definitely would for those of you who do have the capability of doing so and you care about the future of Bitcoin and you care about you know any anyone having too much power over the development of Bitcoin you can always run your own node and Signal towards the updates that you want to see implemented so anyway just to wrap this all up uh Bitcoin ordinals seem to be here to stay it doesn't seem to be a very pressing matter that people want to take it out so for those of you who have invested in ordinals or paying a lot of attention to these it is not all for nothing I think they're going to stick around it's certainly not a super pressing issue at the moment and again I think it's going to prove a use case for other layer twos in addition to lightning Network to be functioning to to broaden what's happening on bitcoin while still facilitating the core layer the layer one of Bitcoin layer one of Bitcoin is always going to be there so that's going to wrap it up for today if you guys enjoy this please hit like hit subscribe see you tomorrow bye

youtu.be/WLckSKzFpE8",1336.0,11484,110,well we have the creator of open AI create a coin but there's a catch plus uh coinbase is in trouble with the US once more and also Paul Tudor Jones says something that I actually kind of agree with uh but first like And subscribe check us down below for our CT Club where we get our trade alerts portfolio updates and you get to see what we are buying during this accumulation phase all right so this is from Mark Jeffrey all right so he he's quoting off a telegraph which said Sam Altman the CEO of open AI uh has close to clinching 100 million dollars in funding for a cryptocurrency called World coin hmm strange why not just stick with Bitcoin because it's pretty good coin right well here's the catch it requires an eyeball scan to create private keys which is he says is is as dystopian as it gets so yeah I'm not going to be promoting that coin on this channel I don't promote very many coins and definitely not that one next we have Paul Tudor Jones who says BTC has a real problem now because the entire apparatus of the U.S Regulators uh are now against it and yeah he's right it's unfortunate Bitcoin is going to flow to places where it's least restricted that's just how things go that's how money flows you know so for instance the UAE you have uh El Salvador money's flowing there because they have an open arm policy essentially over there and it's tax-free so yeah you can't beat it right so unfortunately this is only going to get worse as Heidi and I have said for years now many people have like really bashed Us in the beginning saying no you're crazy stop saying this garbage but now it's coming out like hey they're really cracking down on bitcoin and and also crypto as well all right so now speaking of cracking down we have coinbase which is likely to face SCC enforcement action similar to bittrex and Kraken I mean I hope nobody is surprised with news like this uh you know like I said Heidi and I have been telling people this is only going to get worse and by the week it's getting worse which is ironic that they're holding the Bitcoin 2023 conference in the US considering how badly they have treated this space let's move on to another Western superpower we have the European Union passing laws requiring identification for all crypto transactions ah really that's probably why Ledger has come out in the open saying hey they're just getting people used to probably uh kyc and their customers so here's some of the details that you finance ministers have approved the world's first comprehensive cryptocurrency rules coming from the financial times all exchanges and wallet providers must be licensed names of senders and recipients of transactions must be recorded regardless of the amount uh yes so they're going to be really cracking down we all know why they're doing this this is this shouldn't be a surprise to anybody you know for the new currency that is coming out I can't say it because I'll get Shadow ban uh but that is what is happening right now it's a com a uh Bitcoin is in Bitcoin and and all other cryptocurrencies are a direct competitor to a centralized Fiat system okay this is why we promote Bitcoin you know okay uh next we have Elon Musk who says Twitter plans to create a more efficient Financial system than traditional banking now here's the catch here a lot of people trust Elon Musk I personally don't and why don't I look at all the funding that he got from the US government I'll just say one 500 million dollars from the Department of Defense to help him out with his neural link program why would they give him 500 million dollars yeah doesn't make sense so I don't trust the guy whatsoever and if he's going to and look at who the new CEO of uh Twitter is she is a a lover of the world economic Forum say no more next we have U.S citizens debt passes 17 trillion dollars for the first time in history yes so no matter how much you vote for whoever or how much you hope that a country is going to get better this stuff is out of your control because you are not a central bank that entices this stuff and and controls the amount of currency that is out there this is what central banks do this is what happens when you have a central bank that is out of control they in debt their own citizens especially since 1971 since Nixon took the US off the gold standard so if you look back at 1971 when Nixon took the US off the gold standard the money supply has increased crazy amounts right and the US dollar has lost about 80 percent since then right and actually in the past I think it was the past three years the U.S money supply or currency Supply big difference uh expanded 86 percent and you wonder why you're experiencing more and more inflation even though the the Federal Reserve saying oh yeah we are quantitative tightening bullcrap so guys that is all I have today I hope you enjoyed it um sorry there's a lot of bad news but there was also good news because we do have a way to preserve our capital and to keep up with inflation at is Bitcoin and that is why it's number one in our portfolio and if you want to see our portfolio a little link is down below for our CT Club talk to you soon bye-bye

tips for beginners to be using in 2021 and beyond now if you're thinking about getting into crypto i highly recommend it i've been involved in this space for the last six or seven years and i'm gonna have both my coinbase and etoro accounts pulled up and i do want to show you you know where i've been for the last year it's been actually a really crazy year for me so my account grew from 3 000 over 100 000 and we're back down to 30. i've taken some profits along the way which you're not really going to be able to see here but i have learned a few things that i do want to pass along to you now if you guys could also smash like when on this video i would definitely appreciate it and obviously if you haven't subscribed please do that as well now the first thing and this is very important research before you buy anything now there are a few different ways that you can do this on both etoro and coinbase which i'm going to show you here now any coins that you look at buying there is going to be a news feed there's also going to be built-in communities into some of this stuff and you can also you know check the websites out for the different projects now i'm going to pull up the graph real quick here you can pull up different price charts obviously you also want to take a look at the price because you don't want to be buying coins that are like skyrocketing normally you want to wait for the price to be going down a little bit before you buy in that's kind of one of the keys here but you know the graph crypto you can check out their website you can check out all the websites for these different coins so you can at least learn a little bit about what they're trying to accomplish and uh you could also head over to google type in whatever the coin you're looking at is you can find different groups like they have do reddit groups in different communities as well so research guys that's very important right uh the next thing i would recommend doing is sticking with the top 30 coins there's a website called coinmarketcap.com this pulls up all of the coins out there you know from the top coins like bitcoin and ethereum all the way down to coins you've never heard of before but i would stick to the top 20 and top 30 coins because i just think that's gonna give you the best results for like success you'd want to be buying coins that are ranked like 200 hoping that the price is going to go up you want to get some coins that have been around for a while and if you look at the top 10 or top 20 or top 30 you know you're gonna find some coins with some stable price points uh the next thing you're going to want to do here is buy five different coins and i'm going to go over some coin recommendations this isn't going to be financial advice do your research but let's say you have a thousand dollars i would put 200 bucks into five different coins so you kind of like spread your money out and uh you know if one coin goes down a lot you don't like freak out and uh panic but ethereum would be a coin i would recommend i'd also recommend checking out chain link uh it is up a lot for the last year but i do think chain link could get up to 20 to 30 bucks for sure another coin i really like is uh gonna be stellar xlm this coin's also up a lot for the year but it's got a lot of potential to go higher it's taken a little bit of a downtrend recently but i think if you can get this one between like 10 and 13 cents and you're willing to hold on to it for a while i could definitely see it going up quite a bit now i'm gonna pull up etoro because there's a couple coins i like over here as well uh i do like tron trx this is a top 20 coin it's down right now um for me personally but it's up for the year uh i do like this coin a lot and if you can get it under three cents i think it's a good buy i could see it getting up to like 10 to 15 cents for sure i also like xrp now there is a lot of speculation around this coin um you know it's been in the top three to top four coins for a while it's taking a price beating but there is opportunity here if you can get it between you know 17 and you know 25 cents you're willing to hold on to it for a while i definitely think it's a good one now you also need to figure out how long you want to hold these coins for so you can do what's called swing trading that's what i've done here on coinbase it's allowed me to you know grow my account to what it is over the last year that's where you buy in um and then you hold for a little bit and then sell at some point whether it's a few days or a few weeks and then you kind of like rinse and repeat you could also hold for the long term where you hold for over a year if you're just trying to do it that way you can do it that way as well um and then another thing guys don't get emotional if a coin goes down you know i've had times where i've been down thousands of dollars and i haven't like panic sold uh you got to remember why you bought in a particular coin and as long as you kind of stick with those fundamentals and you don't forget that just don't get emotional and just sell because it does suck losing money so anyways hope these five tips help you guys out uh if you have any questions feel free to message me below please smash a like button subscribe if you haven't thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next one

the crypto industry Elon Musk actually just tweeted about the project and its price is already skyrocketing by over 11 600 percent in the past 24 hours but the crazy thing is this isn't the only project Elon Musk could be involved with as there is another secret project that Elon could be about to send to the Moon so what are the two projects that Elon Musk could potentially be invested in and what is your best plan of action to make the most money possible in today's video I will be answering these questions and I will also be updating you with the latest big news in crypto also just before we go any further this channel has a daily giveaway of 1 million Sheba tokens to enter all you have to do is be subscribed to this channel like this video and comment hashtag Shiba Inu good luck also guys remember this content is not Financial advice and beware of scammers in the comments now just before we get to the Elon Musk news we first need to quickly update you on the biggest news in crypto today PayPal holds over one billion dollars in cryptocurrencies what projects are they invested in payments Behemoth and Elon Musk founded company PayPal has disclosed in a form financial report filed with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission that it is holding nearly one billion dollars in cryptocurrency assets this news comes on the heels of PayPal's announcement that venmo now facilitates external transfers of cryptocurrencies to wallets and exchange platforms PayPal's latest quarterly earnings report filed with the SEC reveals that the payments giant is sitting on a substantial stash of Bitcoin and ethereum as of March 31 2023 PayPal's crypto Holdings include 499 million dollars in BTC and 362 million dollars in ethereum with an additional 82 million dollars in other cryptocurrencies that the company supports impressively PayPal's crypto cash has surged by a whopping 339 million dollars since December 31st 2022 when digital currency values were significantly lower PayPal currently has four cryptocurrencies available to buy on the mobile app these four cryptos are of course Bitcoin and ethereum but also Litecoin and Bitcoin cash so we can assume part of that 82 million dollars is invested in Litecoin and Bitcoin cash but the other projects are still a mystery at this point remember we are going to be showing you two projects that Elon Musk could potentially be invested in so make sure you watch until the end to find out the name of both projects now let's get to the first project the first project that Elon Musk could potentially be invested in peaked and over 11 600 percent gains in the past 24 hours completely insane gains and could have made millionaires but the market cap is still only 100 million dollars so therefore the tokens price could still go much higher not only this but the project also has an nft collection that more than doubled in floor price since Elon Musk tweeted about the project Elon musk's tweet triggers nft projects priced to Skyrocket boost sales by 500 percent Twitter CEO Elon Musk has done it again the crypto evangelist recently tweeted a gif of a subculture nft boosting the digital Collectibles sales to its high as 500 percent and sending its floor price to Skyrocket allowing it to Surge to the top trending spot on the marketplace over the years musk has had a sweeping impact not only in introducing game-changing Technologies and products to the world but also in sending the prices of crypto assets like Dogecoin to Skyrocket musk's tweets have in the past caused the price of the world's first ever mean coin Dogecoin to Rally last month the tech billionaire changed his profile picture Toshiba Inu the popular mascot of the mean coin causing it to rally over the course of April in the past elon's tweets have sent tokens prices Flying in October 2021 Elon Musk tweeted a picture of his Sheba Inu dog this tweet directly caused Shiba inu's price to Skyrocket to all-time highs and reach a market cap of over 38 billion dollars this week musk shared a gif of a Milady nft saying there is no meme I love you which significantly impacted the non-fungible tokens performance in ways never before seen musk's simple tweet triggered the nft floor price to see a 59 percent boost over the past seven days pushing it to hit an all-time high 4 price of 7.3 ethereum worth 13 700 before it slowly fell back to 5.6 ethereum worth 10 509 a few hours later moreover musk's tweet boosted Milady sales increasing it by a factor of 500 percent over the previous 24 hours milady's recent performance also allowed it to climb to the top trending nft spot in the popular non-fungible token Marketplace Open Sea but the Tweet didn't only affect the nft collection's price it also massively impacted a crypto project with a project called Milady meme coin up over 5990 percent in the past 24 hours the token currently has a price of the number on screen right now a market cap of 148 million dollars and a 24-hour trading volume of 202 million dollars it is also the number one trending project on the crypto price tracking website coin gecko meme coin Pepe recently got to a market cap of 1.8 billion dollars if Milady mean coin were to reach the same market cap you can make over 5 500 in profit from just a 500 investment if you want to buy the project it is currently listed on the mexc exchange you can sign up through the link in my description and you will be eligible to receive free crypto it is also really important to note that on coin gecko it says please note that this project is in no way affiliated or associated with Milady the nft project please do your own research before proceeding but just because it isn't officially affiliated with the nft project doesn't mean it won't continue to go up in price whenever Elon tweets about Dogecoin it also makes sheaves price go up even though the projects aren't affiliated and the really interesting thing about this project is that according to Cone Gekko the project was made on May 9th exactly 36 hours before Elon musk's tweet this almost seems too convenient but of course this is just speculation but I know what you are thinking if this project is up over five thousand percent you have already lost early movers Advantage but the other project that Elon Musk could potentially be involved with hasn't spiked in price yet and at the current time only around 10 000 people know about this secret project what is the second project to find out information about the other project you have to go on to Elon musk's Twitter account and then click on the three dots then you need to click view lists once you click this you will be shown a list created by Elon Musk the list is just called monkeys the list currently has only 10 000 people following it this has led to many people thinking that Elon Musk could be about to start tweeting about a cryptocurrency with a very similar name with people on Twitter saying yeah we saw that join our tribe they are speaking about the monkey's crypto project this is a crypto project called monkeys token watch until the end to find out how much you can make from this project and how you can buy the project currently monkeys is priced at 2 200 units with four zeros the token also has a market cap of 11 million dollars it also has a DEX tool score of 99 out of 99. so what could monkey's price get to again if monkey was to get to a similar market cap to Pepe which peaked at 1.8 billion dollars that its price would be 36 units with only two zeros using the crypto profit calculator this means you could net a profit of over eighty one thousand dollars to invest in the project you will need to go through the uniswap exchange I would advise going to the token's official website where they have a link that brings you directly to the uniswap by page but this isn't the only crypto project that Elon Musk is potentially involved in because he could actually be incorporating a decentralized projects technology into Twitter find out what the other crypto project is by checking out the video on screen now

multiple things going on the next one may be multiple things um it's no longer a single thing that drives adoption I think because the industry is bigger there's more players so there's different sectors we should be looking at what's the next big nft thing and what's the next next big D5 thing what's the next big new things maybe social media for crypto has not been invented yet right so and there's some old use cases that have not taken off but are slow are starting to payments millions of cryptocurrency investors developers Executives of exchanges and other crypto related firms and other stakeholders in the industry are on the lookout for the next big thing in crypto in previous years we've seen things like decentralized Finance defy non-fungible tokens initial coin offerings

against the industry everyone is quite ready for something huge according to binance founder and chief executive officer Chang Peng jio popularly known as CZ the cryptocurrency industry is at a stage where one can expect multiple money making opportunities to pop up almost at the same time CZ and binance are expecting and preparing for such opportunities to pop up anytime soon in a recent interview the chinese-born Canadian business executive was been the subject of several mainstream media smear campaigns in the past few months highlights his outlook for the cryptocurrency industry amid the many problems currently facing the global economy during the interview with the beckless podcast CZ gives a recap of previous Bull and bare crypto markets and what the past could be telling us about the present state of the industry the binance CEO believes we are in the recovery stage from last year's turmoil and lots of new and revamped opportunities will soon begin to pop up for investors with enough motivation and funds to jump in Caesar also discusses Market cycles and why the world urgently needs crypto we will now bring you clips from cz's interview don't forget to smash the like button drop your comments and observations in the comments section and subscribe to the channel if you are yet to do so you can also check out our other videos featuring interviews tweets and price predictions from some of the industry's brightest Minds thanks and enjoy the video it's a mixed mood right now it's an interesting mood right now I think so um from my experience uh from I joined like I got into crypto from 2013 right so that was one bull market um that year and so went from 100 to a thousand dollars and then you know there's a one year drop in 2014 and then 2015 we started to recover and so it's one year sharp drop and the one year recovery and then wow two years of all-time highs so that's 2016 2017. 2017 21 000 um That Was Then everyone's rushing at the 2013 was like a Bitcoin cycle everyone's like well what was this new thing about Bitcoin 2007 he was an Ico year so ethereum erc20 tokens anyone can issue a token a white paper you know a fundraising um and then so and then you know 2018 happened crash and then 2019 was paying for recovery and then um 2020 21 again the sort of all-time high years again and you know there was D5 nfts uh gamify matter servers all of this stuff and all of this stuff are still quite new but a lot of money put in and then 2022 you know there's three arrows there's Luna uh there's FTX so it was Crusher so I think now even if we look at the price chart we're kind of recovering so now it's kind of a recovering mood and people are still very cautious it's not like fomo yet but now there's like meme coins which I don't really afford which I don't really fully understand um but there's also at this stage is unclear in wow two years what's the next drivers that will cause explosive growth right um uh is it is it I don't think I think I think it might be something new right I think nfts D5 they'll continue to grow but those those were inventions of the last cycle um they will continue to grow um and there will be they may actually be more realistic realistic use cases Etc but um from the pers from the from the angle what's going to drive the next one I think the the mood is everyone's looking for that right now we don't we're not sure and this is why and when we're not sure this I think this is probably why a lot of people part into memecoin and they couldn't figure out what exactly is the next one meme coin sounds fun and but it shows that they are funds uh uh that are ready to be deployed right so people people want to buy stuff and they look at meme points they Pile in so that's my read um uh so if we are at uh I believe we're at an interesting inflection point uh again I could be I could be very wrong um hopefully we are at the we passed the bottom of the of the bear market and hopefully we are in the start of a bull market but again this is not Financial advice this is just a feel a mood thing um but you can I could very well be wrong yeah there's nothing says we have to get another cycle um history uh the history pattern is quite clear if you look at it but you know all ones were white until you saw a black one so um and so history doesn't predict the future and um it it we can't we can't just say because previously there was fairly distinct four-year Cycles there's going to be a new one so I think we got to take uh take that into consideration um maybe it may not and so the way I usually uh well the way I would position businesses are we should be prepared for a bull run so we just got to make sure like our systems can handle another 10 20 30 x volume um but we should also be prepared financially for for another 90 crash right so we got to have the we gotta have the stamina to last so that's how that's how we would run a business that's how binance is structured today um so we can we can survive on both sides uh for people um I would usually recommend similar um uh similar situations during discussion on the podcast one of the hosts asked CZ what he believes could be a next big idea in the digital asset space as a result of the bear market and recent price declines the cryptocurrency industry is not as exciting as it was for investors during the 2021 all-time highs period or even last year before the terror Luna collapse many investors are wary of the lack of Regulation and the impact of macro issues on crypto asset prices but even one or two promising developments will bring back some of that excitement and Euphoria we saw that with a fraud themed meme coin Pepe according to CZ there are millions of investors on the sidelines waiting for the next big thing so they can jump in and make some profit the Canadian business executive believes it might not even be one development but a string of new and revamped ideas that would awaken investors and the crypto markets in full force here are more clips from his discussion with the bankless team I think the question should be changed uh it should be not singular but multiple so um the quest if we talk about internet right we wouldn't say what's the next big thing that would drive internet adoption there's so many different things there's video conferencing there's you know social media there's Google as an information hive mind there's a lot of different things going on so in the early days you may say like what's the next thing I think for crypto crypto blockchain is beyond one single thing now so 2017 there was icos right that was erc20 tokens basically um and 2020 even 2021 there's multiple things going on the next one may be multiple things um it's no longer a single thing that drives adoption I think because the industry is bigger there's more players so there's different sectors we should be looking at what's the next big nft thing and what's the next next big D5 thing what's the next big new things maybe social media for crypto has not been invented yet right so uh and there's some old use cases that have not taken off but our slow are starting to payments right payments was one of the most obvious use case but there wasn't stable coins there wasn't lightning Network there wasn't a real-time fast payments uh and now the faster block chance there's been you know there's there's been many new developments and then we also have technologies that allow users to pay in crypto and the merchants except just Fiat and it's the trans as the transaction happens in real time like balance pay bonus card a few other credit card Solutions on in the market so and we're seeing uh um the global economy in turmoil so there's a lot of uncertainty in traditional Financial Industries uh in the in the global economy uh we're seeing like uh Africa you know now the the the the mobile phone smart the smartphone penetration is getting there uh and now they're latching they don't have Banks um only lastly less than 11 of people in Africa have Banks and they're just latching on directly onto blockchain so all of those things can be potentials um I don't know which one I think we'll see multiple um I will I guess you call them unicorns or however you call them multiple successful uh new startups new Concepts and plus old ones um together that will shape the industry actually I did do a talk in um United Nations in Geneva I think four three for 2018 uh maybe 2019. um so I did do a talk but that was more about how to use blockchain to enable um transparent charity philanthropy efforts um but I think today if I was gonna do another talk I would say Financial inclusion Financial access um if if that was if we're talking if the audience is United Nations there are many nations many many people uh without Financial access um people in less developed countries take them days to pay a bill um they don't they don't they don't have access to loans they don't have access to many many of the financial tools that we we in developers are quite used to so that would be the message I will stress and blockchain is that right technology um there was this uh fund that I just in that just gives loans to women um that need loans to run their businesses in Africa um they have the lowest default rate of any loan business on the planet so there's a there's a real woman that want to do business but they have no access to financial to financial tools and they run very simple businesses that do make money and they're able to return the loans in a period of time and this really helps their lives so I actually the name of the of the fund is just on on the tip of my town but I can't recall it so these are these are great things and they can do this with blockchain they can do this with much bigger scale um using the new technologies so all of this can be done so if I was doing a talk like that I probably researched this a bit more on financial inclusion and just stress use cases in those areas a few days ago CZ celebrated China's Central television crypto Focus broadcast alluding that such developments historically lead to bull runs his tweet reads CCTV China central television just broadcasted crypto it's a big deal the chinese-speaking communities are buzzing historically coverages like these led to bull runs Matt saying a pass predicts the future and not Financial advice according to reports the broadcast aired on May 23rd and covered Hong Kong Securities Regulators creating a mandatory licensing system for digital asset providers Julia Leon the chief executive of Hong Kong Securities and future commission SSC noted that clear guidelines for crypto and other digital assets will help the industry sustain itself and Foster more innovation in the region she said and I quote providing clear regulatory expectations is the key to fostering responsible development Hong Kong's comprehensive virtual assets regulatory framework follows the principle of same business same risks same rules and aims to provide robust investor protection and manage key risks this will enable the industry to develop sweatenably and support innovation according to the SSC which has a consultation with industry leaders in February the licensing system will kick off on the first day of June and firms that do not comply could lose their businesses operators of virtual asset trading platforms who are prepared to comply with the sfc standards are welcome to apply for a license the regulator announced those who do not plan to do so should proceed to an orderly closure of their business in Hong Kong about two weeks ago strike founder and chief executive Jack mallers also announced the global launch of the platform's app in over 65 countries expanding access to its revolutionary payments and Bitcoin services to almost 3 billion people worldwide these developments show that despite the bear Market there are lots of moves being made to prepare for the next Bull Run and the many opportunities that will come with it when it does begin the industry will be fully prepared for it what are your thoughts on cz's discussion with bankless what do you think will be the next big thing in the crypto and overall digital asset space please drop your comments and observations in the comments section below also

today Rishi Sonic becomes UK prime minister he wants to make Britain a global crypto investment hub Rishi Sonic who served as Britain's Chancellor of the exchequer from 2020 to 2022 and chief secretary to the treasury from 2019 to 2022 has become the prime minister of the UK he succeeded Liz truss who resigned after four to four days in office as prime minister Sonic formally accepted his new role from King Charles during a meeting at Buckingham Palace on Monday after winning the conservative party leadership many people have called Sonic Pro crypto for his efforts to make Britain a global hub for crypto assets technology and investment as announced by the UK government in April he said at the time it's my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology and the measures we've outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest innovate and scale up in this country the British government also affirmed that it will see stable coins recognized as a valid form of payment as part of wider plans to make Britain a global hub for crypto asset technology and investment moreover the government noted that it will explore ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system to encourage further development of the crypto asset Market in the UK Sonic also commissioned the Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token we want to see the businesses of tomorrow and the jobs they create here in the UK and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term Seneca Pine this is part of our plan to ensure the UK Financial Services industry is always at the Forefront of technology and innovation however the new prime minister is also pro-central Bank digital currencies which has caused concerns among some crypto advocates in October last year he explained how cbtc's could benefit businesses and consumers as the G7 issued report on the subject Sonic also set up a task force to lead the UK's work on a central bank digital currency Central Bank digital currencies are a very controversial topic so let me know what you guys think about them in the comments below if you are still watching it would be massively appreciated if you could go ahead and smash the like button it costs nothing and really helps support the channel also keep watching to find out the cryptocurrency that could completely take over the social media industry now let's get into the main story of today's video some musk officially owns Twitter something that I'm sure lots of people didn't see coming a few months ago but this is one of the biggest business moves in the past 10 years but what does this have to do with a social media cryptocurrency well a couple of months bacolin musk tweeted saying free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle this poll resulted in 70 percent of people saying no illin musk replied to the Tweet saying the consequences of this poll will be important please vote carefully it has been sent before that Twitter has a political bias this was made clear with the Banning of controversial ex-president Donald Trump with lots of people thinking he was unfairly banned due to the fact that Twitter is one of the biggest Platforms in the world it's extremely important that there is no political bias as the power of Twitter could literally control elections now there is no stopping Elon Musk from having his own political bias except there already is a solution completely trackable blockchain algorithms to prove that no opinion is being Shadow banned and hidden from most users on Twitter now what if I told you that there was already a token which is specializing in developing a decentralized social media this token has also raised over 200 million dollars and is backed by Sequoia and recent Horowitz coinbase Ventures Social Capital polishing Capital Winklevoss Capital Pantera and many others this token is called decentralized social ticker diso is musk's endorse's answer for decentralized social blockchain the deso foundation announces the release of its ambitious roadmap to decentralize social media and build the social layer of web 3. Milestones on the roadmap will be executed over the next two quarters to solve the major problem with social media today most people don't realize that social media is more centralized than the financial system was when Bitcoin was invented only a handful of companies currently control what we see and do online we can solve this problem by decentralizing social media and storing all content on a blockchain said Nader Al Naji founder of to sell the road nap release comes as new messages emerge between Ellen musk and Jack Dorsey showing their ideas for a blockchain-based social media protocol that does payments and short text messages the two billionaire entrepreneurs discussed how Twitter would be better off as an open source protocol funded by a foundation instead of a company Dorsey expressed regret over making Twitter a company calling it an original sin the foundation's role in an open source blockchain-based social network would be to finance and Advance its development musk called it a super interesting idea and offered to help however once Dorsey failed in his attempt to get musk on the Twitter board he eventually left the company but now that Ellen musk owns Twitter this completely changes everything it is the only answer to creating a completely unbiased decentralized social media platform many experts expect decentralized social media to be the next huge Market opportunity which top crypto research firms have assessed to so ranked first in massari's seven other crypto Trends analysis due to the overall addressable Market in the next decade social media is predicted to attract 6 billion users and be worth trillions of dollars a blockchain-based social network would highly appeal to the 50 million creators in today's economy who are always looking for new platforms the Creator economy is currently valued at 100 billion dollars about the diso foundation to sell is a new layer one blockchain built from the ground up to decentralized social media and scale storage heavy applications to billions of users to sell the native currency of the DeSoto blockchain is listed on coinbase daso is currently priced at around 16 with a market cap of over 168 million dollars if this token is incorporated into Twitter's software it's safe to say we could see the market cap completely Skyrocket to over 2 billion dollars this would give the token a value of one hundred ninety dollars using the crypto profit calculator from just a 500 investment at the current price you could see yourself making over five thousand dollars in profit before ending this kindly note that the prices of cryptocurrencies frequently change so by the time you watch this video it might have changed to a whole new value the information provided in this video does not constitute investment advice Financial advice trading advice or any other sort of advice and you should not treat any of the content as such the content in this video is for educational purposes only and hence should not be considered as Financial advice do conduct your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions now if you want to hear more about some undiscovered crypto gems with market caps as low as 3 million dollars then make sure to check out the video on screen now you won't regret it

altcoin Buzz have discovered the next big game-changing crypto narrative for big gains we've been talking about it plenty it may not necessarily come as a surprise it is privacy but the fact is there are lots of projects in the space chasing after this narrative there are at least two dozen projects out there by our account whose major focus is privacy So today we're reviewing three of our favorites three privacy focused altcoins that we ourselves have invested in [Music] oh welcome to the channel my name is Maddie and this is altcoin Buzz do not forget about our new partnership with Bible they are giving away 30 000 in bonuses you also stand a chance to win a new iPhone 14. check out the links in the description of this video or stick around till the end and I'll explain it in a little more detail best of luck as always if you choose to invest just remember that I'm not an official Financial or investment advisor and so this video of course is not official Financial or investment advice we're starting off our list here at number one with a look at Mina protocol ticker m-i-n-a Mina and the protocol is unique first of all its size is Tiny it's only 22 kilobytes and although usage can grow its size always remains constant and Mina works with ZK snarks so this means zero knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge that's in a nutshell what this is but here's an even simpler explanation you prove something without providing any insight into what needs to be proved in other words you confirm information without revealing that information in the process that's the same as with all ZK technology but here's what Mina protocol can do specifically so it can run Mina on your mobile phone at the same time you run a full node by the way and it can verify long calculations for accuracy it can also verify data sets without knowing all the details and these are very much the ZK snarks at work and in action Mina does not share the data even if requested however it does share proof of data and it can also interact with websites other blockchains don't or can't do this but Mina can access real-life data it's almost like an Oracle in that sense because Mina's ZK apps take care of this seamlessly so those are some of the pros of mina now let's take a big picture and consider some of the cons to be fair so for instance the biggest issue is is that it's got a pretty low and slow transaction speed it has a TPS or transactions per second of 22. now that's marginally better compared to bitcoin with seven TPS however if we look at other chains Solana for example it has 50 000 TPS or sui with a potential of 200 000 TPS that's really our only knock against Mina hopefully in the future it's something that will be remedied but on the whole we love this project and if you do as well you can buy it on buy bit and take part in that promotional campaign that I talked about and we'll also mention again at the end of this video privacy altcoin number two that we're looking at today is secret Network ticker s CRT and secret network is really one of those quiet builders that keep working in the background without necessarily a lot of fanfare they are all about privacy they are ogs in this space as you may know secret is one of the 59 owns in the cosmos IBC also known as the internet of blockchains and secret has some pretty interesting and new recent updates let's take a look at these there is for instance their latest Network upgrade I am happy to report that the network is now on version 1.9 however the team calls it IBC V4 plus vrf it's kind of like a revamped version of the IC protocol it now offers secret surge this is a defy incentives campaign you can earn extra rewards up to four million dollars actually when providing liquidity in secret apps so for instance shade blade Sienna swap or secret swap you can take advantage from April until October there's secret vrf a verifiable random function which is an API it randomly generates numbers and works cross-chain so for instance and just as one example it makes nft minting gaming or Dows secure and when it comes to minting it adds random traits and numbering so in gaming boot boxes or gambling all of this needs to be random and the vrf takes care of this it also emphasizes the start of privacy as a service they also offer packet forward middleware this moves assets or data around in a much simpler way you can now route IBC packets with a single transaction and it's between various chains by the way there's also the IBC emergency button and this can temporarily halt IBC transactions so for instance when somebody steals funds on an IBC Dex it needs a multi-sig address and governance approval and finally there's the secret tunnel this replaces older bridges for ethereum and BSC and the tunnel is on axillar so on the whole we have another privacy chain with plenty of impressive features change that key building during the bear Market are always going to catch our attention and in this case they're building great things we are impressed and they're most likely going to Surge in the next Bull Run at least in our opinion this is certainly a project that we have placed our faith in and another such project last but not least on our list at number three today is LF zero ticker a-z-e-r-o and for context the original cyberpunks who helped get Bitcoin started in the first place were all about privacy that was really a top priority they were all cryptography guys and they shared this belief that Tech could either improve personal privacy or destroy it really it had the potential to do both and with that pedigree in mind it's exactly what lf0 is trying to accomplish they are very much trying to preserve personal privacy this is one of our favorite projects overall that's one reason it is at least and it's definitely a favorite in the Privacy sector and they have a couple of exciting new features on the horizon and they're all private see enhanced so for example there's tangent this is a hardware wallet and has the size of a credit card however it requires an NFC phone and this is technology that allows for contactless payments it's open source and does not collect user data then there's also signer this is a browser extension that helps you manage your private Keys it's not a wallet but think of it rather as a solution that can hold a secret there's also dashboard and this is already live you can manage your a0 and related coins here so for things like staking bonding or unbonding and it has a very friendly user interface a0id this is the first ever private domain system liminal 1.0 so the Privacy enhancing layer for lf0 with ZK technology this is going to hit the streets this year in 2023 and liminal 2.0 will soon follow and is the full version and finally we have common a decentralized exchange which will launch in 2023 if you stake a0 you are eligible for a common token airdrop just want to remind you once again and as I talked about at the beginning of the video you can win up to thirty thousand dollars just click the link in the description below and if you have any

going to be a super important factor in blockchain technology moving forward this is my position as a channel it's our position we've mentioned this already many times across various videos really for years now and lap zero is setting itself up to become an important player in this field of privacy it's a layer one blockchain so in other words lf0 provides the infrastructure so that other projects can build on top of it we really like this project in fact we just featured it as our number one pick in our 50x crypto strategy video a few weeks ago check it out of course if you've not already and in order to promote privacy alef offers a public blockchain but with private smart contracts and so as a result lf0 offers good use cases for real life businesses this includes fast transactions for example a TPS that's transactions per second of one hundred thousand it also uses state-of-the-art tools for developers and in addition you can plan your costs for chain usage and the liminal privacy layer makes all this possible it integrates ZK that's zero knowledge technology and a second popular privacy technology late in March of 2023 these smart contracts went live and at last the lf0 ecosystem kind of came to life so to speak let's dive in and take a closer look to see who these new players are [Music] foreign guys to the channel my name is Maddie this is altcoin Buzz I wish you luck if you choose to invest honestly but I'm not a financial or investment advisor and so this video is not official Financial or investment advice let's start off with number one mainnet 10.0 on a left zero so until late March you could stake your a0 that's a-z-e-r-o coins on lf0 mainnet the devs were building their dapps on the test net but this change with the upgrade to mainnet 10.0 and so now the Inc 4.0 base smart contracts come to life there's also an ecosystem funding program to attract new projects and developers of course and this allowed for over 20 projects to launch on the mainnet and this includes all kinds of projects from a wide variety of sectors for example defy nfts metaverse explorers privacy wallets and identity T management projects and others in general though just a quick word of advice and hopefully Common Sense these are all new projects so be aware of potential scams or in the case of nfts flat out drug polls it's not unheard of with new mainnets so don't be too eager and of course always do your own research at number two we're looking at defy and right now there's quite a lot of interest in defy on lf0 these are mostly dex's decentralized exchanges but there are also lending protocols they are not all live yet however so a few of them that we'll look at here include common a multi-chain DEX that is not live yet they will be on near Solana kusama and ethereum and this is a project by the lf0 team another is Andromeda Swap this is an amm an automated Market maker Decks that is already live we also have z-stake where you can stake access liquidity pools and a casino and this has been live since the 7th of April they have their own z-stake that's z s t a k e token Panorama swap a swap with liquidity pools and soon to be multi-chain as star Network and Shibuya Network are going to join soon there's also ink whale where you can earn fixed interest on tokens or nfts on the out of 0 Network abacs a lending and borrowing protocol soon to go live but not yet sidekick finance and together with jumpstart they created a way to crowdfund your project with nfts it is a cross-chain platform and the idea is that you can have your campaign up and running in minutes and last of the D5 group here is sinther Omni chain synthetics and this is going to be available on eight chains including ethereum polygon Avalanche BNB Aptos and sui third category we're looking at here is nfts and there are a few nft Collections and launch pads some are already live not necessarily all but a few examples here include art zero an nft Marketplace and launch pad so for example a0 punks and bitfunks both launched here they also have their own nft PMP or praying mantis predator and this nft generates passive income a0 punks the first NF ft collection that dropped on lf0 it has a size of 10 000 Collectibles and currently 40 percent are already minted and bitfunks which is a collection that has three thousand three hundred and thirty three pixel art Collectibles The bitfunks Have A doxed Team all right category number four and which is perhaps the most important on this list is privacy liminal is alavzero's native multi-chain privacy layer and it works with zero knowledge technology and secure multi-party computation otherwise known as smpc that's probably an acronym that you're going to be hearing more about in the future again secure multi-party computation smpc and with ZK or zero knowledge technology you can prove something without revealing important information so smpc keeps sensitive information spread over many nodes instead of only in one place which means that no one can Reveal Your sensitive data because they don't have it only part of it a single computer can't access the information and there will also be Bridges with Cosmos kusama near binance smart chain and ethereum this year we see liminal 1.0 and then a full version liminal 2.0 will follow in due time and with synchra you can create privacy enhanced Dows it offers a no code solution as a matter of fact and as a result you can set your Dow up in minutes the liminal privacy layer plays a big role in this as well and finally the fifth category that we're counting down and kind of celebrating I guess is explorers which play a significant role in blockchains because they show you the immutable on-chain data if you are looking for new blocks investigating your transactions or looking for staking information it's all available on explorers and currently there's one dedicated Explorer subscan there's also a0 live this is a validator that offers all kinds of staking related information so for example alerts for validators changes in commissions top gainers and a lot of other metrics as well but to be clear a0 live is not a block Explorer where you can search for transaction info but it does have excellent Network information that you can freely use the final category that we're briefly going to touch on today is the metaverse and we're looking here at the dark verse drk vrs no candy colored theme metaverse approach here this is a beautiful gloomy kind of aesthetic so if you're an outcast and you don't fit in and anywhere else in any of the candy cane metaverses that Exist Elsewhere maybe this one is for you welcome to the dark side of the metaverse so to speak right now it's a work in progress but it promises to be something entirely different and we look forward to the finished result

Although Ethereum isn‚Äôt done‚Ä¶in¬† this first quarter of 2023‚Ä¶a game-changing¬†¬† upgrade is coming for ETH that will push it¬† to new heights, reinforce its position as the¬†¬† DeFi settlement layer, and the upgrade will¬† rocket certain altcoins to the MOON. What‚Äôs¬†¬† the upgrade & which altcoins? Find out in about¬† ten minutes, because it‚Äôs time for Chico Crypto! What is this game-changing upgrade¬† coming to ETH this quarter?¬†¬† Well pulling out the Ethereum roadmap, we can see¬† the next upgrade after the merge is withdrawals What are withdrawals?? Well the ETH2 chain¬† is now secured by staking validators,¬†¬† who are required to have a 32 ETH stake on their¬† validator node‚Ä¶.but since December of 2020,¬†¬† any person who staked, had their¬† 32 ETH locked, unable to withdraw‚Ä¶ Well with Ethereum‚Äôs next upgrade, named Shanghai,¬†¬† withdrawals are a confirmed GO!!!¬† And Shanghai is coming very soon,¬†¬† the Ethereum devs just had their execution layer¬† meeting, where they told us when‚Ä¶.lets listen in‚Ä¶. Public testnet this month, and then¬†¬† Shanghai on the mainnet in March because¬† the news about is already releasing!!! Why is this BULLISH!!?? Before Shanghai,¬† Eth2.0 staking was unavailable for withdrawal,¬†¬† which made many users skeptical of¬† staking ETH. With this barrier out¬†¬† of the way come March, the demand for¬† staking ETH will rise exponentially‚Ä¶ Checking out the beacon chain website, we can¬† see Ethereum is coming up on half a million¬†¬† validators‚Ä¶with withdrawal implemented the¬† amount of staked ETH is going to explode.¬†¬† A Mark of DeFiYield App tweeted ‚ÄúAfter the¬† Shanghai Eth update, developers expect that¬†¬† by the end of 2023, 80% of the $ETH supply¬† will be staked. At the moment it is only 14%‚Äù (Link #2 Solana Validators)(Link #3 Cardano¬† Validators)(Link #4 Avalanche Validators)¬† 1 million ETH staking validators¬† would put Ethereum into a category¬†¬† other blockchains could only dream of‚Ä¶checking¬† out ETH ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù Solana has barely over¬†¬† 2000 validators, Cardano has just over¬† 3200, and Avalanche has just over 1200‚Ä¶ Even where Ethereum is right now, with 500k¬† validators‚Ä¶it has 15,525% more validators than¬†¬† the next most robust, Cardano with about 3200¬† validators. Withdrawals are just going to push¬†¬† this number up even further‚Ä¶to where these¬† competitors will never be able to catch up‚Ä¶ So my friends, I solo stake ETH & that is¬† what I recommend everyone do. If you have¬†¬† 32 ETH don‚Äôt stake with centralized¬† entities like Binance‚Ä¶not your keys,¬†¬† not your coins!! To stake, I use an avado i7,¬† the plug and play staking hardware that takes¬†¬† the complexity out of the staking process‚Ä¶you¬† don‚Äôt need to be ‚Äúsuper‚Äù technical with avado. And guess what? One of the Chico¬† army members heeded my early advice,¬†¬† getting 32 eth and an avado‚Ä¶and¬† they just found their first block,¬†¬† which means they get the¬† transaction fees for that block, Link to purchase avado can be found at¬† ava.do/shop/cc which I‚Äôve included in¬†¬† the comments and description of this vid if¬† you are thinking about solo staking soon!! Although, regarding withdrawals this is¬† going to open up a new narrative & major¬†¬† opportunities for altcoins who focus¬† on liquid staking derivatives‚Ä¶. Liquid staking derivatives? What are¬† those?? Well many people don‚Äôt have 32¬†¬† Ethereum to stake so liquid staking protocols¬† were created where users pool together their¬†¬† Ethereum and the protocol stakes it¬† on their behalf, in return users are¬†¬† issued Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) to¬† represent their stake of Ethereum in the pool. And again, with withdrawals opened¬† ....those without 32 Ethereum,¬†¬† the people who have just a couple or¬† maybe even a half an Ethereum‚Ä¶will¬†¬† be more inclined to stake with¬† these Liquid Staking protocols. Now the most popular LSD protocol?? That has¬† been LIDO since it launched in December of 2021,¬†¬† 1 year after ethereum staking¬† went live in December of 2020. As we can see from this dune analytics dashboard¬† on ETH 2 and staking, LIDO is #1 with over 146¬†¬† thousand validators giving them a¬† market share of nearly 30 percent!! This isn‚Äôt good, having nearly 30 percent¬† of ETH validators controlled by just 1¬†¬† entity‚Ä¶.but let me tell you‚Ä¶LIDO is a short in¬† my honest opinion, and with Shanghai coming in¬†¬† the next couple of months, other LSD‚Äôs are¬† going to eat heavily into that market share‚Ä¶ Why? Nearly 30 percent of¬† all staked ETH is in Lido,¬†¬† because of the high emissions of $LDO¬† token for staking with them‚Ä¶which is¬†¬† a big incentive provider in Curve for¬† the ETH/stETH from Lido liquidity pool. Now emissions of $LDO tokens is ending and will¬† not be able to support the incentives they ahd¬†¬† been providing in the ETH/stETH LP on curve, which¬† was a BIG reason people were staking with LIDO.. In my opinion, because of the token¬† emissions going away, many people and¬†¬† even large funds are going to look for new places¬† to stake, where they can get Higher rewards!! Soooo where will they move? Well you guys¬† know I‚Äôve been a big fan of Rocketpool¬†¬† for the longest time, providing updates¬† and providing the alpha on the regular‚Ä¶ Well things have paid off lately‚Ä¶last week¬† the RPL token was added to the big exchanges¬†¬† like Binance and Kucoin‚Ä¶leading¬† to a big boost in the price‚Ä¶ Checking out dune analytics, we can see RPL¬† market share is way down there compared to Lido,¬†¬† just above 2 percent share‚Ä¶.so obviously¬† Rocketpool still has a ton of room to¬†¬† grow‚Ä¶and the BIG exchanges see that, it‚Äôs¬† why they listed their governance token‚Ä¶ Rocketpool is going to rocket come March‚Ä¶.but¬† there is another LSD protocol which is seeing¬†¬† massive growth lately, and in my¬† opinion will also steal a bunch¬†¬† of LIDOs staking market share‚Ä¶and¬† this one has the most room to grow‚Ä¶ Checking out the dune analytics dashboard‚Ä¶.FRAX¬†¬† Finance has under a .3 percent¬† market share of Ethereum staked‚Ä¶ Why will people move to FRAX? Well¬† Frax offers the highest APR in the¬†¬† business for staking with them, which¬† hovers in the 6 to 10 percent range,¬†¬† while the closest competitor¬† rocketpool is offering about 5%... How are they able to provide such high APRs?¬† Users deposit ETH and receive frxETH. frxETH is¬†¬† backed 1:1 with ETH but It has no¬† attributes like rebasing and does¬†¬† not accrue any staking yield. So where¬† does that yield come from? Well frxETH¬†¬† can be used in DeFi applications such as the¬† ETH/frxETH Curve pool & since Frax Finance is¬†¬† one of the largest $CVX holders, users can¬† earn a high yield (~10%) on Convex Finance! Basically, Frax is replacing Lido and that is oh¬† so bullish. Cheers viewers I‚Äôll see you next time"

20 on the week and certain projects of 50 it honestly brings happy tears into my eyes but the real question is will this last though or will it just turn out to be another pump fake where we have a

cryptos that you guys should be looking into for the month of March 2023. now this is gonna be be a good one so make sure you guys watch all the way through and as always make sure you guys smash that like button subscribe if you guys haven't already I make videos all about crypto and how you can become rich from it so if that interests you guys make sure you guys subscribe also congrats to those that picked up Aptos after watching my last video I mentioned it when it was about three dollars and now we're sitting at close to 13 so Props to you guys all right first up we have xrp or Ripple now before you guys click out of this video hear what I have to say because if it wasn't something big I wouldn't be mentioning this to you guys anyway now as we all know Ripple and the SEC have been going through a lawsuit for well it feels like forever at this point I think it's been like over two years now which is honestly insane also I just want to clarify because I see a lot of people confuse the two Ripple and xrp are two completely different things people think they are the same but they really aren't Ripple is a technology company that develops blockchain based solutions for payments and other things and xrp on the other hand is a cryptocurrency that is used to facilitate transactions on Ripple's payment Network and the SEC is suing the company Ripple not the crypto xrp now I'm not going to bore you guys with all the details of why the lawsuit is going on I'm sure you guys already know or you can obviously just look it up I'm here to show you guys why I think xrp will be a good buy because of this lawsuit now recently the CEO of Ripple came out and said the ruling of this lawsuit will most likely be reached towards the first half of 2023 which leaves us with only about one to two months before we hear what the final verdict is now the reason this is big is because one this has been going on for over two years now so there's a lot of eyes on this lawsuit and two the verdict or the decision that's gonna happen is not only important to Ripple an xrp but also for the whole crypto ecosystem because xrp is a top 10 coin so if Ripple wins this we're gonna see some crazy stuff happen because for the past two years xrp has just been there no one's been talking about it exchanges like coinbase and crypto.com have even removed it from their exchanges because of what's going on with the lawsuit and even with all that xrp still managed to hold its rank as a top 10 crypto which is honestly super impressive and it just goes to show how much people believe in this project and not to mention xrp didn't even get to partake in the biggest crypto Boron that we saw in history yes people could buy and probably were at the time but no one was because there were just so much uncertainty with this lawsuit and with everything going on I mean xrp did even pass his all-time high from back in 2017 which every other coin did from what I can see there is just so much tension and pressure built up within xrp if if that makes sense to you guys because tons of people truly do believe in the project and do want to buy it I mean it's an OG coin back in 2017 everybody was going crazy for it but now people are hesitant and just waiting and waiting for a result and I think with all this pressure being built up for almost two years now once the result does come out whether good or bad we're gonna see some really big effects in the market and I want you guys to know xrp and ripple are not just any other project in the crypto space I'd go far as to say no other project is doing or can do what they're doing especially with global banking so how this all works on a large scale is global Banks use Ripple's payment Network to send and receive payments with other banks that are also on Ripple's Network so for example if a bank wants to send US dollars to a bank in China it could use xrp to convert those dollars into xrp and then convert the xrp into Japanese Yen on the other end now because of this you can get faster and more efficient Global Payments and transactions can be settled in seconds rather than days and it can also be a lot cheaper and eliminate the need of middlemen and foreign exchange fees which will save the banks a lot of money that that's one of the reasons why these large Banks bank xrp because it'll save them a lot of money and just make things very easy for them now like I said xrp and ripple have been at this for years now and have huge probably the biggest banks behind them and if it wasn't for this lawsuit I honestly think xrp would be closer to 510 maybe even the 15 price ranges so in my opinion I think the price we're at right now is still very cheap compared to the long-term potential that xrp has now obviously a lot of the price ties down to what the final verdict of this case will be but remember even if Ripple loses this lawsuit that doesn't mean xrp will just vanish because remember they are two separate things from one another now yes the effects will still have an impact on xrp's price but the way the Ripple team has been fighting for this for over the past two years and just how much work they put into everything I don't doubt they have a good contingency plan set as well alright if we look at the price action for xrp currently it's ranked number six for coin market cap price of 39 cents um up only two percent on the week when all these other coins are up 16 10 13 only up two percent um obviously it's because of the lawsuit and everything going on xrp just doesn't get any attention like I mentioned um if we head over here to the technicals um if we add in some trend lines we're definitely like an upward Trend over here and we also for the Lux all go indicator we also have a strong signal so honestly in the short term if you want to trade this xrp is a good buy obviously this is not more so of a technical play it's more so of a fundamental play but if we compare the old all-time high three dollars to where we're at right now that and if we were to buy at these price levels right now that'll put us at a 669 return if we end up going back to all-time high levels which I really do think we can if not even pass it and head over to five ten dollar levels because xrp is solving a multi-multi-trillion dollar problem and it has Banks legit the largest banks in the world in its pocket so I really do think once we see the outcome of this lawsuit and if we really do see it in the next couple months not only xrp but the whole crypto ecosystem will have a big effect also I I forgot to mention uh for these indicators a lot of you guys are always curious about them um I use Lux algo it's basically an indicator that tells me when to buy and sell it works with a whole bunch of different assets you can go over here and use it for stocks Forex crypto anything on Trading video just sits on your trading view chart and then you can customize this to however you like I've been using this I've talked about them plenty of times I've been using them for years as well definitely an awesome indicator if you guys want to check it out I'll put a link to it down below definitely change this is the whole trading game especially for me and I know it'll help you guys as well if you guys are into trading so this lawsuit even though a lot of people aren't talking about it right now and there's not a lot of press around it I promise you when the time comes in one to two months everyone is going to be talking about xrp in this lawsuit and it'll have a huge impact on the crypto Market all right next up on the list is H bar or hedera hashcraft now I feel like I talked about this coin before but honestly it's such a sleeper coin that a lot of people still aren't paying any attention to it so it needs some more attention now the reason to look out for hbar is because it's the only project of its source nobody else is doing what they're doing and nobody can do what they're doing either see what makes hbar unique is that it's governed by a council of probably the most elite companies in the world companies like Google LG T-Mobile IBM Tata and tons of other ones and how this console works is each one of these companies has an equal voting right on decisions for the project and they can only be on the council for six years so there's always a new set of ideas coming in as well now what also makes hbr unique is that as of right now they are the only hashgraph coin and the hashgraph protocol is an open source protocol so other projects and coins can be built on it as well so hbar has a first movers advantage and they also partner with Dell and added them to their console list as well now if you look closely at the companies on their Council they have huge internet companies like IBM Dell Google these are companies that pretty much run the internet so hpar has this huge network of elite companies pretty much just in their hands and just imagine how much potential and the things they can do with this alright if we look at the price action for H bar hedera currently the price is eight cents down four percent on the week which I I don't know why it's down because every other crypto is up on the week but nonetheless it's a good opportunity to buy in that case because you never want to be buying when crypto's up so that's a goodbye if we look over at the price action um remember like I said in the last clip if you guys want these Buy sell signals which what I use when I make my trades or make any decisions on buying um I use Alexa I'll put the link to it down below you guys can just insert it into your trading view chart but um if we look at the four hour chart for hbar we're definitely an upward Trend I mean look at this where we hit a low of around three cents 3.8 cents um what is this 3.7 cents we hit a low and we've just been climbing ever since the thing with h-bar is it ties very well with xrp because it has those companies in that traditional factor to it you know like traditional companies traditional Banks tied to the coin so if xrp is lost to whatever happens with that I really think um it'll have a strong correlation with hbar because usually whatever happens with xrp I've noticed the same thing happens with uh H bar now obviously xrp doesn't move as much and there's different considerations to take with that coin I'm also going to be watching hbar closely as we get closer to the as we get closer to more information with the lawsuit but as far as price predictions I mean 50 cents was an all-time high I've seen a lot of people who are backing hbar and say each bar can easily go to you know a couple dollars five dollars um honestly I think that might be the case it just we just have to see how everything plays off with all these companies because yes they're on the council but are they really making any changes like are we going to see anything big is hbar gonna be integrated with these companies that's all for us get to see what happens and then that obviously will have a correlation with how high the price will go finally we have file coin now this is also a coin a lot of you probably already heard by now and I know I've talked about this plenty of times before but I can't stress how big this coin will be in the future currently it's around eight dollars but it's had an all-time high of close to 200 now file coin is all about storing data in a decentralized way basically today how Company Store data is they use platforms like Google or Amazon to store it and then Google and Amazon will build these massive server warehouses to store this data the problem with this is the servers that they build are centralized so if you're on the west coast and your server is on the East Coast you'll have performance issues and not to mention how long it'll take for you to access your data because the servers are just so far apart there are different parts of the country centralized servers are also very vulnerable to natural disasters like tornadoes or floods so if your server ever does just get knocked out because of a natural disaster well you can say bye bye to all your data and for big companies that's a very big issue everything you do online today is stored on a centralized server that can have power outages or just be shut down at any time with no notice to you I mean think about it if YouTube or Netflix just goes offline you have no videos to watch and that was all controlled by one company who owned that server that probably had no control as to why the server even went down we've seen this happen time and time again with Instagram for example there's a always some glitches going on our DM's not working apps crashing features just disappearing but if we had a peer-to-peer system like both filecoin is offering something like Instagram or YouTube or Netflix would never crash because all the data is stored on a decentralized server so it removes the chance of Errors happening so that's the issue follow coin is trying to solve their idea is to have someone like me or you'll be able to allow a big company to store data on our own personal computers and we'll be able to make money off of it as well this also makes storing data for these companies a lot cheaper because it brings more servers into the space that they can access from all over the world in different countries rather than just having it all in one spot alright and if we look at the price action for follow coin currently it's rig number 23 on coin market cap with a price of 8.26 up 64 on the week which is insane now I I look more into this there was never like a real reason why the price is up the best thing I found was there's some like changes coming to follow coin where they're implementing the filecoin virtual machine which will bring smart contracts to a file coin but I I don't think that's really the reason why they're up 64 on the week I mean just looking at this is honestly absurd um going from five dollars all the way up to eight dollars or even four dollars on here I mean the the awesome thing is this indicator called it out so if I was really looking into this and I bought this over here I could have made a really good uh profit but um as of right now if we head over here to the all-time high for file coin which I was talking about earlier the all-time high was close to two hundred dollars which is very very high but I just don't see it the price going to 200 again I think a good average price point for file corn would be between 100 to 150 now but even even at the price points where I are now at eight point three dollars um and if we go to like let's say 150 that's still 1700 return on your money so follow coin definitely has a lot of ways to go but that was it Guys these were my top three picks for the month of March I also want to throw an extra coin as well I know I mentioned Aptos earlier I still think it's a great coin with a lot of potential but I'm looking more into the coins within the Aptos ecosystem so something like mosquito Finance which is basically like the uni swap of Aptos are going to be like the uni swap of Aptos so if Aptos continues this growth it's on right now all the coins within the ecosystem will grow as well and I feel like mosquito finance will be a really good pick but let me know what other coins you guys are looking to as well down in the comments section below maybe I'll check them out and maybe I'll mention it in next month's video as always make sure you guys subscribe so you don't miss out any future videos I hope you guys have a great rest of your day and I'll see you guys in next week's video peace

be happier than the person that loves the destination most of us are here to get rich quick and what's great is that desired destination has put us all on a journey that involves learning about a new speculative asset class how the traditional Financial system works how absolutely criminal central banks are in what it takes to build and maintain wealth over time so some of us will reach the desired destination of getting rich and one of two things will happen one we get rich and we are not able to maintain it and end up right back where we started or to we get rich and maintain and grow our Newfound wealth for the rest of our lives and for our legacies to come the difference between the two outcomes is determined by whether we are the person that loves the journey or the person that lives the destination so for some of us that are still focused on the destination we need to have a mind shift to instead learn to love the journey and love the process of build building and maintaining wealth not just gambling on cryptos to try to luck out and strike it big people focused on the destination of getting rich try to take shortcuts by giving their money or crypto to someone else to invest on their behalf instead of investing the time to learn about the industry and end up getting scammed because there are no legit crypto investment mining or yielding Services absolutely zero there are scammers everywhere pretending to be me guy from coin Bureau bit boy meet Kevin Kathy Wood Russell Brand anyone in the crypto or financial space or who has any substantial following at all and they lie by trying to trick you into giving them money to invest mine yield or even sometimes they claim to have fake services to recover lost or stolen funds all of those are 100 scams and to learn more about them check out this video guide by clicking on the link above another shortcut people who are too focused on the destination take is by maybe actually making a great trade realizing massive gains and then they never sell or take profits because they didn't have a profit taking strategy beforehand which you can check out this step-by-step guide on how to do that by clicking in the link above or maybe they didn't learn about the process of how to take profits in crypto because sometimes it's not as easy as selling it on coinbase directly for a stable coin or cash and transferring it to your bank account and then the value crashes down to leaving them back at square one here's the deal we cannot take shortcuts on our journey to True wealth and prosperity we need to invest our time to gain knowledge about what wealth is all aspects about generating wealth and maintaining wealth over time and most importantly we need to earn it we need to truly deserve it we need to give to others provide value to others make a contribution to humanity in the World At Large that is how we manifest true wealth Prosperity happiness and fulfillment because anyone who has realized a significant amount of monetary gain who has been able to maintain it for a significant period of time will tell you that money alone won't leave you you happy or fulfilled when a ton of money is not coupled with a sense of purpose gratitude gratefulness healthy fulfilling relationships in a balanced life overall a lot of money just makes our problems more existential and what's great what I really love about crypto is it inspires a lot of people who want to get rich to inadvertently start a journey that they will either try to shortcut rush through and most likely not end up where they intended to go or their Journey leads them down a path where along the way they learn how to practice gratitude for the things we currently have learn how to generate well how to provide value to the world find a sense of purpose and help others on their journey to a fulfilling life so why am I highlighting this fact the fact that we are on a journey and we need to fall in love with the journey and not focus on the destination if we are actually going to make it because I think this bear cycle might be longer than we originally hoped and there are two ways we can react to this get discouraged and quit or get excited because we may have another 18 to 24 months or so to build our skills increase our income in DCA or dollar cost average into crypto and other Investments at low prices over a longer period of time so when the next Bull cycle comes which it always does it always comes back at some point we can reap the rewards we will have truly earned and will have learned and grown so much along the way instead of arriving and staying at our desired destination we may decide to continue life's journey because we have fallen in love with the journey and have become lifelong Learners that constantly pursue growth who continue to have more and more to give and contribute to others and the world hello I'm crypto Casey and in this video we are going to explore my random wild guess my latest prediction about what I think may play out Market wise for the rest of 2023 and what 2024 may have in store and why we may have until q1 of 2025 and Beyond to prepare for the next full cycle let's hit it [Music] please be sure to check out our sponsors I trust Capital tanjem wallet and Morales Money Trade cryptocurrencies tax-free within your own individual retirement account or IRA with I trust Capital invest in this amazing alternative to Ledger wallets called tangent wallet that never reveals your private keys to anyone ever it's a hardware wallet that is the size of a credit card multi-currency multi-chain super easy to set up and it lets us trade all coins faster more securely and conveniently to take profits on the go and find undervalued altcoins before they pump using morale's money a tool that connects directly to several different blockchains like ethereum arbitrum polygon and more that allows us to set up filters and alerts to create our own unique trading strategies before the next mind-blowing altcoin season so be sure to scroll down and use links below to access the correct and official sites as well as redeem any special offers they have for us sweet my random wild guess is that the markets will continue to be driven by the federal reserve's actions which will involve them continuing to hike rate once to three more times before finally pausing into late summer or fall they will hold the pause throughout the rest of the year and will not start lowering at all in 2023 this will cause more Banks to collapse and merge with larger Banks like JP Morgan commercial real estate will melt down debt everywhere will continue to mount and become more expensive and like we discussed a while ago over the next six months 40 percent of Americans said they would need to use a buy now pay later loan between now and then over 27 percent of which said they would need it to buy groceries they will need to take out a loan to afford to eat to survive which begs the question of whether or not at least in bigger metropolitan areas is civil unrest on the horizon for 2023 or 2024. we shall see what this means for the crypto markets for the rest of 2023 my random wild guess is we will continue to experience largely sideways movement with a random short stints of run-ups and certain categories of cryptos like at the beginning of 2023 we had a mini Surge and useless altcoins with AI in the names from the chat GPT craze then a mini surge in meme coins like Pepe and Floki as of late with China becoming more crypto positive useless Chinese coins are popping off and like we discussed the other day the next surge could possibly be with gaming AR VR and metaverse coins with Apple's reveal of some new Cutting Edge AR VR related Tech on June 5th at the WWDC so if you're a short-term gambling Trader throughout the rest of the year you can try your hand at predicting the next narrative in trying to front run Catch the Wave and sell for potential gains otherwise choosing an amount of money you want to invest over time and choosing a specific frequency that you're going to invest in doing it consistently over time usually works best in the long run which is called dollar cost averaging so for example you decide to buy fifty dollars worth of bitcoin every Monday at 9am no matter what the price is and DCA or dollar cost averaging helps reduce your exposure to price volatility cool another thing to keep in mind about 2023 is the rollout of the new fed now payment system this July which is the foundation on which a cbdc or Central Bank digital currency will be built this is the beginning of the end of any control and freedom we have over our money and property which is why it's so important for us to get politically active because regardless of your political party there are candidates on both sides that are against cbdc's and unless they get into office the global Elites plan to enslave us all by controlling how and where we spend our money will come to fruition and if you don't know the gravity of a central bank digital currency being distributed and enforced check out this video guide by clicking on the link above next now my Ram random wild guess for 2024 this will be an interesting year as we've got the most important U.S presidential and congressional election as it relates to bitcoin so we will start being bombarded on the news and social media with political campaign ads which if you haven't yet check out this video guide on how we can get politically active to support pro-crypto regulations and politicians in just five minutes by clicking on the link above what will be interesting this time around is the fact that we know media has been manipulating and censoring a lot of information about political candidates like by saying no one noteworthy is running against Biden so the Democrats will have no primary debates when we've got pro-bitcoin Robert F Kennedy Jr ramping up his campaign to rival Biden and now we have Elon Musk and Twitter rivaling the big media Mafia letting candidates like Ron DeSantis address pretty much the entire world directly anyone who wants to tune in and listen on Twitter without the restrictions and parameters imposed by the big media Mafia and there are rumors of trump rejoining Twitter so yeah 2 Twitter Media news it's all going to get extremely political leading up to the election another important event to keep in mind for 2024 is the Bitcoin having taken place around April or May of 2024 and if you don't know what that is you can check out my video guide for beginners by clicking on the link above basically a lot of hype will start building up before the Bitcoin having event around January 2024 or so and sometimes that creates some surges and cryptos then the 12 to 18 months following a Bitcoin having event historically we see the Bitcoin price reach new all-time highs now I'm not sure if we would experience this in 2023 or 2024 or even at all but since the FED has increased interest rates too fast too high for too long it could cause a sharp painful compressed period of hyperinflation before falling back down to their two percent Target or even lower because since they default from the U.S debt ceiling has been averted this sovereign debt bubble we are in along with the rest of the world cannot be escaped it can only be worked through and the only way out at this point is for the FED to inflate the debt Away by devaluing the currency and this is one of many reasons why I think the fed and government at large is actively working to destroy the U.S and global economy at large another reason being that they want as many people as possible to be reliant on welfare so they vote to keep Biden in office so they can finish their destruction plan over the next five years the ultimate goal being to force everyone to use the US's Central Bank digital currency where they control the entire world's money however another Trend that will continue to gain momentum through the rest of this year and 2024 is the dollarization and deglobalization more countries will continue to turn away from the dollar and even within the United States we will face fracture between states and the federal government with Governors like Ron DeSantis Banning the use of cbdc's in the State of Florida at the end of the day I think all of this just keeps making a more and more compelling case for Bitcoin in that it's clear that we need neutral open inclusive Global Financial infrastructure where we can all truly own and completely control our property instead of relying on useless corrupt third parties like central banks their political puppets and corporate cronies so if my random wild guess that we have around 18 more months of largely sideways movement in the crypto markets until around q1 of 2025 when I randomly wildly guessed the next Bull cycle will start we need to fall in love with this crazy journey in this insane macro environment and start investing time and energy in learning about this new asset class practicing interacting with web3 technology like decentralized exchanges crypto wallets and more to treat this extra time we may be afforded in this bear Market as a gift in our journey to wealth and prosperity and one of the most important steps we can take as beginners

security companion to to our crypto wallet of choice so we can browse the internet and interact with web 3 more securely I've been using it for a year now and it's been working great popping up warnings helping me check everything before transacting so it's definitely worth checking out and giving it a go in this crazy macro environment when interacting with smart contracts like fermenting

#efinity #immutablex #nft #nfts",4051.0,218405,1103,foreign [Music] look if I came out here and promised you a guaranteed way to make 100x crypto Returns on coins in the current bear Market than I would be lying but what I might encourage you to do is spend a few hours researching altcoin gems in the current bear Market that are currently devalued and that are also sitting below one dollar because this has been the trend previously you look for Quality projects during the bear Market quality projects that are also undervalued and that have unit prices below one dollar that tends to be what people flock to when the bull market comes around next time and that's when they really explode exponentially in value so therefore without over promising anything we are looking at five ultra high quality altcoins all of which are priced under one dollar and we strongly believe that getting into these projects now during this current bear Market is going to pay off big time [Music] hey guys my name is Maddie and this is altcoin Buzz we are a crypto investment research company just a reminder we are talking about altcoins in today's video and crypto as you know is a very very volatile space so take this video to be informative hopefully it is but don't consider it to be official Financial or investment advice [Music] all right let's get right into it and jump right into coin number one here it is immutable X ticker I am x a coin that we've talked a lot about actually on this channel over the last little bit it's a layer two solution which means it's built on top of ethereum and in general they deal with the shortcomings and problems that ethereum presents for example scalability high gas fees and fast transactions and immutable X specializes in games and nfts and they also promise the following so a few points here instant trade confirmation near zero gas fees when minting and trading nfts scalability through ZK Roll-Ups that's zero knowledge with up to 9 000 TPS and they've already minted over 33 million nfts this year by the way with zero gas fees about three months ago back in July we did a deep dive into immutable x with this video which is being played now and you can find a link that should be popping up right about now go ahead and check out that video for more detailed information on the project if you haven't already seen it but among other things immutable X has a very strong team and big backers and some games that run on immutable X include God's Unchained which we discussed in more detail in that last video Guild of Guardians and eluvium and if you're into gaming you most likely know these titles already here's a quick breakdown of their IMX token as you can see the price is sitting at about 64 cents currently with a market cap of 368 or so million dollars the max Supply is 2 billion currently there's a circulating supply of 235 million which is about 12 percent of the total Max Supply and they're ranked number 109 here courtesyofcoinggecko.com metrics now over these last 30 days as you can see there's been some selling pressure on the 15th of September there was a supply unlock that happened although we are noticing an uptick now in the last few days maybe the last week or so it should be noted that we are down 93.2 percent from the all-time high that was achieved in November of last year that Mark was 9.52 so we're down 93.2 percent yet it's still a great project that is doing terrific work behind the scenes it's just honestly kind of been dragged down by the rest of the crypto Market as has happened to a lot of other projects so this is very much a discounted project a discounted altcoin that still presents tremendous value this is a great opportunity in my opinion not Financial advice to pick up IMX on the cheap foreign okay moving right along to coin number two on our list we're taking a look at Oasis Network ticker is Rose r o s e now Oasis network is a Pioneer in privacy enabled blockchain because they focused on defy and data economy and Oasis offers unique privacy features for example they can create tokenized data which allows you to take control of your data and as a layer one chain they have impressive scalability as well which of course enables faster transactions and high throughput but they can also use a sophisticated discrepancy detection tool and Oasis claims that this is more efficient than sharding and para chains near and soon ethereum those both use sharding and the pair chains are polka dot territory but in addition to that Oasis also boasts a very strong team a high value Venture capitalists are among their backers and they've also partnered with dap radar and furthermore Oasis has a 350 million dollar developer fund and their potential seems very high but admittedly they have a bit of a smaller ecosystem for the time being at the moment they are only involved in seven defy and three nft projects and this is exactly where they need to do some work and demonstrate some growth back in August we talked about Oasis in this video check out the link that should be popping up right about now but here's the update as far as tokenomics Rose is up at the time of this recording it's sitting at about 5.7 cents with a market cap of 287 million dollars now the max Supply is 10 billion of which we have 50 or 5 billion in circulation it is ranked number 128 by coinggecko.com it's recovering from the recent dip that it experienced in the last week or so we like the numbers overall let us know what you guys think about Rose in the comments below and let's go ahead and move on to coin number three which is Mina protocol ticker Mina m i n a this is the lightest blockchain by the way in the world it is only 22 kilobytes for context that's opposed to ethereum which is 500 gigabytes we're talking orders of magnitude here indifference and so naturally this makes it very easy for anybody to set up a node anybody can do it and that's in contrast to the difficulty presented by certain other chains and Mina protocol's focus is on privacy and security specifically for web 3 they do this with ZK snark technology Mina has various strong backers which cumulatively allowed them to raise 92 million dollars it should be noted that three arrows capital is among them that's not everybody's favorite name so just pointing it out it's still a young project similar to the last entry on this list so they also have a relatively small ecosystem but that being said they still have a very impressive and a very extensive roadmap we also talked about Mina a few weeks ago in that August video check it out if you've not already the tokenomics are as follows Mina is up 6.7 percent at the time of this recording with the current price of 57.7 cents and a market cap of just under 410 million dollars now the max Supply is infinite so if you're not a fan of those kinds of tokenomics just take note of that but the circulating Supply right now is 588 million out of a 965 million total Supply they are listed right now in the top 100 ranked number 99 according to coinggecko.com their vesting is over eight years however one thing to look out for is that their token is inflationary and as I mentioned infinite but still there's lots of potential and we don't view that as a deal breaker although we understand that maybe some of you do if that's the case let us know your thoughts about Mina in the comments below and without any further Ado let's move on to coin number four our fourth altcoin which is priced under one dollar at a bargain it is Affinity ticker EFI which is a cross chain Super Highway bringing nfts to polka dot now look we love Affinity whether or not it's below one dollar in price but the fact that it is represents an incredible bargain in our opinion and we're big fans at least in part because Infinity was developed by engine and we are big fans of what they're doing the engine network has 20 million worldwide Gamers they're also the ones that developed the erc1155 token standard but going back to Affinity it's a polka dot parachain and they want to make nfts accessible to everyone and they want to do that with low fees and cross-chain interoperability their paratoken standard accepts all tokens from other chains and they have prominent backers and have raised 38.9 million dollars EFI has been pretty volatile lately here's a snapshot of where we stand at the time of this recording it is up 10.7 percent in these last 24 hours currently sitting at 11.3 cents with a market cap of only 62.9 million dollars this is still a baby the max Supply is 2 billion tokens of which we have 26 or 518 million circulating this is a little bit further down on the list here number 352 among the crypto rankings that's according to coing gecko.com so this is a relatively smaller cap entry in our list which means it's extremely high potential a few months ago we did a dedicated video on enj and EFI the price of both if you're an Enthusiast and you think that this has as much potential and as high as ceiling as we do you're going to want to go back and check out this video from April foreign [Music] and finally coin number five on our list here of great altcoin projects priced below one dollar we saved this spot for Moonbeam ticker g l m r this is really actually an all-time favorite of mine and back in February of this year we did a dedicated video about Moonbeam you can find the link here that's popping up on screen they also build on the polka dot parachain like affinity and the project started back in January of 2020 and two years later they launched on polka dot Moonbeam effectively is all about multi-chain and they are also by the way evm compatible they were one of the first projects actually to get a pair of chain and as a result they have a very solid ecosystem this month they've been extremely busy for example the rare same nft Marketplace launched Cask protocol was successfully integrated Omni C launched that's their nft launch pad and Wormhole announced their launch on Moonbeam and keeping mind this isn't even an exhaustive list currently there's a lot of good momentum going on for Moonbeam and as you can see there are lots of Partnerships and Integrations happening glmr is the token they're up a little bit more modestly than some of the other entries on our list with the current price of 48 cents at the time of this recording their market cap sits at 200 million dollars now the max Supply is also infinite and there's a circulating Supply currently of 395 million out of 1 billion total Supply they are listed at number 159 according to coinggecko.com and by the way if you're holding glimmer you can get a 32.8 percent return if you lock your glmr for up to 120 days even if you choose to lock it for only 90 days that still returns you 19.6 so if you're holding that token on binance and you're not planning to actively play around with it in any way you may as well lock it up and stake it because those are fantastic rates so if if you're looking for that 100x crypto return at this exact moment I'm not going to promise you that I'm not going to lie to you guys but I do strongly recommend that while we're in this bear Market you check out some of these undervalued layer ones and layer twos that have massive goals and Ambitions and are building actively during this bear Market in order to achieve them next you should look at the crypto projects that are getting attention from really big investors and I'm happy to say that all of our entries on this list are getting that attention these kinds of projects are undervalued right now they're doing great work they're only being dragged down by the rest of this absurd bear Market at this point and they are poised to blow up in the next crypto Bull Run so among these entries that we talked about today let us know in the comments below which one is your favorite which best altcoins under a dollar have we potentially left off this list let me know guys of course best of luck if you choose to invest but never official Financial or investment advice you know that if you're still

it has reached its peak guys so yeah the token is picked and now it went a little long but guys this is just normal for the project that is just starting because after the peak the price comes down a bit a bit lower and then this is the perfect time to invest before the next bullish breakthrough goes so it's very transparent and very good for this community because it's it says that it has started with a good start and it knows what is doing the token and the price is going to be stable in the future so definitely very good stuff from them as you can see here is the chart showing you here you

today's video we're going to go through some of the biggest catalysts for the market the duckling weeks and also months now you've probably seen the market recently it's not the best most exciting thing at the moment but there are some really important key information and data and news and events that's going to be affecting the markets over the next few weeks and months I want to cover that in today's video and much more so stay tuned and definitely watch the very end if you're new here and you want to see more videos like this be sure to join the crypto busy family today and subscribe and if you do like the video make sure to leave a like it's very much appreciated and do comment down below your thoughts and opinion do you agree with what I've said in today's video do you disagree all comments are very much welcome so that being said guys let's run straight into the video let's have a look what's happening with the markets for today you can see right now that bitcoin's price is coming in at around 26 700 this is also affecting the rest of the market what we would usually see with the way that the crypto markets ebb and flow and we have they fluctuate is that usually the stock market or the general economic Outlook that sort of affects how the crypto markets perform it affects ultimately Bitcoin first and then it will also affect the rest of the all coins so it'll affect ethereum and ethereum's the king of the old coins and that will affect the rest of how the market will perform if we have a look at some of the key data it's important too you can see here that the Bitcoin dominance is coming in at around 46 and ethereum stoleness is staying strong at 19 we've seen ethereum's dominance over the past few years increase just that bit by bit and that is I think affecting the rest of the market in a positive way we're not seeing the majority of the capital being put into Bitcoin as much as we want to see Bitcoin do well we also want to see the rest of the market perform well as well and for that to happen we need to see the Bitcoin a dominance be below 50 and ethereum someone's you know staying at around 20 and the rest of those percentages be in the rest of the all coins the market cap as well for the rest of the market or the whole Market altogether is about 1 trillion is 1.1 trillion dollars this is a significant amount of money that's in the market but it's nothing compared to the rest of the stock market I think the stock market is something like 50 60 trillion dollars worth in terms of its market cap the market cap for gold is something like 12 trillion dollars so we're nothing compared to the traditional Financial spaces and in my opinion that is a lot of good news for the future in terms of growth so that's a big thing if we have a look at bitcoin's Price action over the past month and a bit I mean this is on the daily time frame of bitcoin's price as you can see since the beginning of May we've only really been seeing you know sort of a nearly sort of a high uh 20 000 and for the past week or so we've been seeing bitcoin's price just sort of trading nearly two weeks now at this point range trading between 26 and 27 000 many people saying well why is this the case there's a number of factors at play here I think we have a look at the general economic Outlook that's the first thing you know we're still not out of the woods just as of yet when it comes to inflation and at the moment we're seeing a lot of things for the debt ceiling I'm going to go into that in much further detail as well and so I think ultimately the market is just waiting for that big news to come into play for Capital to be deployed it's a lot of things at play here but I think there's sort of a quiet time again as well you know we have to take into account how the year plays out you know there's people out there you know the institutions the executives of of the institutions usually have their summer holidays coming up you know when you have a look into it how the year performs the Academic Year really does affect how the rest of the market performs I mean it's quite quiet between the months of July and August and then sort of we see a sudden burst in price action in September and that's usually when Executives come back from their holidays they've had a nice rest and then they come back and they say well let's buy and sell and that's where you see a bit of the liquidity get back into the market and we see something similar happen also throughout December and then also getting into the new year as well so a lot of factors at play Let's have a look at some of the biggest factors and I think this is probably one of the biggest factors we're seeing at the moment is bitcoin's price action compared to the debt ceiling now the debt ceiling limits or the debt limit itself has been in discussion for over the past few years the United States government have nearly hit it quite a few number of times over the past few years and many people were saying well you know we can't just keep on raising the debt ceiling for the United States because at some point they have to start paying it back somehow and so right now Joe Biden has a lot of headaches at play it's not just the 2024 election that's coming up next year but it's also you know domestic issues as well including the debt ceiling now it doesn't matter what department you're in whether you're in the military department whether you're in the healthcare department whether you're in the education department doesn't matter you're all affected by what happens with the debt limit the debt ceiling and can the US government pay their debts it's a big thing because at this point when we have a look at the debt ceiling when we have a look at everything else that's affecting it let's just have a look here as well and the debt ceiling why is it important it's important because if the United States government if they can't pay back their debt they can't pay back their loans then what does that mean for the US dollar I think it would signal to a lot of countries across the world who use the dollar as as their Reserve currency and the US dollar right now is the reserve currency it would put a lot of fear into those countries that trade in the US dollar it would put the dollar itself on a pedestal of well of Doubt ultimately and that would not be a good position for the dollar and would not be a good position for the United States and that is where you're potentially going to be seeing a lot of investors go into some assets that may have a hedge against what we're seeing right now against the US dollar so one of them may be gold another one could be Bitcoin and also I think we've been seeing some interesting price action for Bitcoin over the next few weeks and months as we see this debt ceiling Fiasco play out in the United States government and how Joe Biden might affect it I think ultimately I think they may raise the debt ceiling again I'll be very surprised and shocked I think the rest of the market will be if the US that debt ceiling but you know the responses to this and and you know in terms of the default of this debt scene it could happen on the 1st of June as soon as the first of June so this is going to be pretty much next week at this point which I think would Sparkle the fear into the markets that's what we could be seeing sort of an initial knee-jerk reaction in bitcoin's price potentially going sub 25k maybe even below that as well and then from there I think we're gonna be seeing bitcoin's price you know creep up a bit just again and have that next leg up to the next level because that's what we're going to be seeing sort of opinions and reasons as to why people buying Bitcoin at that point after the knee-jerk react so that's the first thing there that is what's happening with the debt ceiling it's waiting for a big Catalyst that is what Bitcoin is waiting for at the moment you can see here right now what we've been posting on our Twitter linked down the description below so you can check out yourself in much further detail and if you're on Twitter as well do give us a follow it's very much appreciated you can see here you know which way is big one going to be going is it going to be 25 or 28 in my opinion I think we're getting a new joke reaction to 25 this could go either way but I think in my opinion that's what I think things are going to be going and then from there as well again it's going to be a huge driver for the next few weeks so just be aware of that this debt ceiling talk is going to be big so I want to make sure that I've given as much you know information about how this is possible now Biden has warned of job losses economic disaster if debt ceiling is breached I think part of that is true part of it is not true I think he's saying these things because he wants to get the Republicans to vote for the debt ceiling to be raised but then again you're just kicking the can down the road for the next government or the next Administration to take hold of to deal with no U.S president whoever you may be whatever flavor of party may be either side it doesn't really matter you don't want to be the president that's responsible for the U.S defaulting on its debts that's not a good position and you don't want to go down in history because of that so of course Joe Biden's going to be saying this regardless of whether we argue seeing job losses or not or an economic disaster or not he wants to have the say from the Republicans and as I have said in the beginning part of the video a Biden Trump Face-Off in 2024 wouldn't be the first presidential rematch one of the other rematches as well but it's not going to be the only problem that mine has to face for next year so it's a big thing and then you can see as well gold could run into new high record if USD falls on his investors and they flee to safety we're going to be seeing similar situations with also Bitcoin as well in my opinion other a catalyst that are affecting the market as well as one mention as well is what's happening with the coinbase situation right now again it's trying to get a madamus from coinbase itself as you can see uh coinbase continues efforts to get mandamus for the SEC to respond to rulemaking petitions so the SEC is going after everybody at the moment if you've been part of the xrp army for the past few years you're very well aware of what the SEC has been doing with ripple labs and what they have been affected effectively doing with the rest of the market for crypto I think ultimately right now you know the SEC want to make themselves to be the Bastion for you know regulatory sense in this space but they're just coming off as not knowing really what to do and it's not really a good position for any institution to be a part of but uh you know the cryptocurrency exchange filed a petition for rulemaking with the SEC in July and was served with the wells a notice for potential violations and securities of Securities Law in March so it's not going really well for them but I do think it'll be playing out quite well another thing as well that's affecting the markets is also this Ripple or SEC case I think ultimately arguing seeing some positive news by mid-june hopefully by the end of June but we're seeing with Brad garlinghouse he said that it could be sold by the end of Q3 of this year and if we do see that then that'd be a big thing so that's I think end of September if we do see sort of announcement or a decision made at some point because the decision needs to be made at some point because it is holding back not only xrp but at the rest of the market it doesn't just affect xrp it affects the rest of the market other positive news in my opinion is that Hong Kong retail investors are to start trading a major cryptocurrency tokens from the 1st of June at the same time the US may be defaulting on their debt so it's an interesting sort of uh two things happening at one there as the new virtual assets regime kicks off this is the big thing and I think it's a really good thing I I totally support this it's amazing that we're going to be seeing different crypto hubs pop up in Southeast Asia and Asia I like it's amazing to see and I think this will bring a new wave of economies going into these areas or sort of microeconomies being formed and it's a good thing because it will ultimately lift those economies out of the different situations and I think for people who are trying to get in certain social Mobility that is also going to be a big thing as well because you get a lot of issues solved sort of inadvertently by increasing the social Mobility there and I think cryptocurrency is going to be part of that guys but do comment down below whether you agree or disagree and then the Chinese ethereum conflux draws Spotlight as Hong Kong welcomes retail Traders this is gonna be a lot of things to look out for the Asian Traders they know what they're doing it's a big thing when it comes to affecting the market one way or another it does affect things positively negatively whatever you may see from that but they do have a lot of liquidity a lot of capital to deploy so we have to wait and see where things are going to be going for that I also need the points I wanted to make in today's video is that you know although bitcoin's price is stagnant at the moment it just seems a bit dead at the moment the Critter markets don't be fooled because we've seen this many times before you know we've been a part of the crypto space for over five years now we've been training for over seven years we know what happens when we see that sort of that moment of calm it's usually a calm before the storm and the storm could be positive and negative it could go either way I think we are going to be seeing a knee-jerk reaction to sub 20 5K for Bitcoin that will affect the rest of the markets but from that new joke reaction I think we're going to be seeing bitcoin's price creep up just a little bit higher going into the end of Q3 and a lot of things that play I think the big thing we need to watch out for is that U.S debt default if we see that happen then maybe some other things happening from that as well and I don't think they're gonna be looking good but there you go that's just my opinion

UCF-i8KsrPZLDcLqAoGdXU4A,2023-05-20T08:15:01Z,,U6KKBi-b3u8,Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum: Discovering the Next Big Crypto Innovations 2023,,1.0,31,1,have you heard about ethereum it's a blockchain-based platform that is changing the financial world as we know it in this video we'll explain what ethereum is how it works and why it matters ethereum is a decentralized network that is based on blockchain technology just like Bitcoin but while Bitcoin is used primarily as a digital currency ethereum is much more than that it's a platform for building decentralized applications or apps that run on blockchain technology one of the key features of ethereum is its smart contract functionality smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code once the conditions are met the contract is automatically executed without the need for any intermediaries this can be incredibly useful for various applications from Financial transactions to Supply Chain management to voting systems smart contracts can help to reduce costs and increase efficiency by removing intermediaries and automating processes but what about the cryptocurrency that powers ethereum that's called ether and it's used to pay for transactions and execute smart contracts ether is similar to bitcoin but it's designed specifically for use on the ethereum network in order to use ethereum you'll need to have some ether you can buy ether on cryptocurrency exchanges or earn it by mining once you have ether you can use it to pay for transactions on the network and execute smart contracts one of the challenges of blockchain technology is scalability as more people use the network it can become slower and more expensive to use but ethereum is working on a solution to this problem called ethereum 2.0 which will move the network from a proof-of-work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake algorithm this will make the network faster more secure and more scalable allowing it to handle more transactions and accommodate more users so why does ethereum matter because it has the potential to change the way we think about finance and Technology by providing a platform for decentralized applications ethereum is democratizing access to financial services and online Mercury [Music]

well going forward and I personally hold these coins in my portfolio I believe that these coins are going to help me build my multi-million dollar portfolio going into the next Bull Run and that's something that I just wanted to share with you guys with that said nothing in this video or any of my other videos is an endorsement for you to go out and buy crypto right you guys have to do your own research I am simply telling you what I am doing in this market with that said on top of it I am not a financial advisor I'm just a guy sitting in a hotel room talking about cryptos that I'm particularly excited about let's jump straight into this video briefly touching on the reasons why I think that the crypto markets are gonna do pretty well going forward first of all we have a lot of talk around the town the crypto town that people are bracing for impact the market could see an explosion if China lifts its ban on crypto now right now from my understanding this is pure speculation but I would say this is probably going to happen as we see the Western countries England Australia earlier and America all turning a blind eye towards crypto having too much of a harsh standpoint on it just a few days ago we saw Australia stop people from being able to on and off board from binance using a bank transfer which is absolutely ridiculous in my eyes I think these Western countries are going to get left behind because crypto in my opinion is similar to the internet that we saw many moons ago and I think it's ridiculous they're not trying to keep up with the rest of the world and countries like China the Middle East and a number of other countries out there I believe are going to see the potential in this space and are going to actually look more favorably towards this Market going forward and these sorts of things could be the start of the next Bull Run if they happen now like I've said on this channel many times I don't believe that we're currently in a bull run we may be just starting out or we may have some other legs downwards so anything I'm talking about in this video has the potential to drop significantly if not go to zero we are also talking about some meme coins in today's video which of course hold the most amount of risk but they have a much higher risk to reward ratio with that said guys there are also other issues in the market like the debt ceiling which may be hit very soon in the next few days which could spell disaster in the short term for the overall market and we do still see a massive correlation between the S P 500 and Bitcoin itself and as you know Bitcoin tends to dictate what the rest of the Market's going to do with that said we do see meme coins basically decoupled from the market over the last couple of weeks which has seen some incredible absolutely wild gains we've captured a lot of those both here on the Channel with multiple 10 to 100 x's and also in my private group so if you do want to come over and join that private group there's a link down there in my description it's an awesome Community you get to see my trades my portfolios and you have other like-minded people doing exactly the same thing and it doesn't matter whether or not you're a beginner or you're Advanced there is something for everyone in that group so if you don't like it within the first three days you can simply drop me or the team a DM and we will give you a full refund no questions asked now with that said let's jump into all right first of all of course Bitcoin and ethereum are my number one place right those are the biggest positions in my portfolio I continually dollar cost average and add the profit that I make for example from meme coins into these two coins meme coin specifically into ethereum other plays like Leverage positions that sort of stuff into Bitcoin I am continually growing these positions and I would just make this video solely about Bitcoin and ethereum but I know that's going to piss a lot of people off so I'm not going to do that today but always those are my biggest positions that won't change when the ball run comes believe you me I'm taking profits from everything with that said let's move on to our first coin today and that is tenant now this was a pre-sale over on Dao maker down maker is one of the best launch pads out there some of the returns that they've had is absolutely incredible and I don't think tenant is going to be any different now this is a very interesting project a large scale project here tenant implements a diverse proof of stake restake your staked assets to validate of smart contract Networks cured by an omni chain governance and we can see down here that the tenant ecosystem comprises of a stable coin a decentralized exchange native gauges a lending Market Ava which is a multi-chain AI powered web3 wallet that is the gateway to crypto for non-technical people around the world and there will also be third-party applications they have huge advisors like Josh who leads product at anchor which is another huge decentralized infrastructure protocol and you guys can go check that out for yourself we've spoken about anchor here on the channel before that's made awesome gains as well and we do have other advisors here and there is a huge roadmap that is taking place as we speak of course the project did just go live on seven different exchanges just a few days ago I was part of this pre-sale now of course like I said you have to go out and look into this but they have just under a hundred and eighty thousand followers right now launched on seven of the biggest exchanges out there and they have some huge Partnerships happening in this space as we can see from the price action there was a violent move of when this project was leased onto the market and what we've seen is actually a very nice sideways action from then on out there hasn't been any huge dump downwards which is good this is the kind of movements that we want to see here yes for some reason this isn't showing the actual all-time high but it did of course go higher than this that's a completely normal thing that we see on the launch day of a project and like I say all the time on this channel if you are trying to get involved in a newly launched project it's always best to sit on the sidelines and wait for a better opportunity rather than chasing that initial pump and right now we are seeing this sideways action which could result in explosive move upwards if the market stays bullish of course we've spoken about the things that may happen like the debt ceiling which could have a negative effect on the market so please do keep that in mind if you do want to learn more about tenant you can get over the coin market cap and over here you have all of the links to their website the Twitter and everything else that you need to know about this project again guys I am holding tenant myself so of course take that information as you will and let's move on to the next project now this is moonwell moonwell has an absolutely tiny market cap at 1.6 million circulating right they also have a larger market cap of fully diluted which is 25 million just under so there is a very small amount of this Project's token out on the market which could mean that there are further unlocks which push this price even lower but I do believe that this shows some potential as a moon bag for me the project is another lending protocol built on moonwell at the moment but what they are planning to do is launch on base which is coinbase's new ecosystem that they are launching coming relatively soon now again we have advisors for this project Justin Lee is former coinbase inventures we got Alex from Dapper labs tokensoft and Ledger we got again Elias here from coinbase and someone else from Sushi swap so huge investors and investments from coinbase Ventures coinbase Ventures invested into this project at a higher valuation than it is right now this gives me an idea I'm just speculating and guessing best Ventures invested moonwell planned to launch on base which is obviously coinbase's project this is all pushing towards a narrative where coinbase has a lot to do with this project which could result in the future of a listing potentially on coinbase now I have absolutely no idea if that's going to happen there's a high probability that it will not happen but I'm willing to put a small amount of my investments into this project slowly dollar cost averaging because I believe there is huge upside potential again I don't know but today I did decide to buy some moonwell dollar cost averaging into my bag I am down from my initial investment and by dollar cost averaging at this price I bring down my overall cost basis which is something that I want to do with projects that I intend to hold for the long term now moving on from moonwell we have xtp another project that I am down on since I started slowly investing into this if you have been following my channel for a while you know my investment strategy for my long-term portfolio is simple DCA as the price falls down I can dollar cost average into the project bringing my cost basis down down meaning the second there is a bounce I'll be in profit much quicker than if I had just put all of my investment right in at the very start so that's what I personally do xtp currently sit just under a 40 million dollar market cap for fully diluted and just under 5 million for the circulating market cap now tap is of course an exchange token it's the governance token for their exchange and they are fully regulated and licensed which is something that I want to see and they do have 13 000 followers over on Twitter fully regulated in Gibraltar and their app is to seamlessly send receiver and manage your money and crypto all in one place now the reason why I want exposure to this is we've seen so many times exchange tokens do extremely well don't get me wrong we sometimes see exchange tokens do absolutely terribly like FTX going to pretty much zero those are possibilities we don't know if that's gonna happen for xtp or not I'm putting a little bit of money into it because I see potential upside and of course we've seen this a number of times on the channel BNB coin bit gets coin and a bunch of other exchange tokens all have done very very well in this space so I believe that if we do head into another bull market xtp can see some price action going upwards but of course it all revolves around the overall market and whether or not we can push out of this little bear Market space that we're in I of course also dollar cost averaged into this today with my own personal funds now moving on to another exchange this time it's a decentralized exchange it's Vella this is a decentralized Perpetual exchange so you can trade Futures using your metamask or your non-custodial wallet I believe that this is going to do very well we see GMX which is really the leader in this space at around a 500 million dollar market cap and this is during a bear market so I believe that GMX can go much higher from where it is today and in turn I believe that Vela can also do the same I think that vela's user interface is great I think the product is great right now they haven't launched the mainnet they were in beta and when they were in beta there was an opportunity to create volume on The Exchange in order to get yourself an airdrop and that's something that I did and brought to you guys here on the channel I also hope develop in my personal portfolio and our dollar cost averaged into it today because I believe that there is still upside potential for this in and around maybe a 10x in this space no one really knows how far the next Bull Run can go but again slowly dollar cost averaging for the long term when we're in a space like this which is exactly what helped me in the last bear Market to grab some awesome prices for projects for example cardano was one of the biggest returns that I made in the bear Market from Simply paying attention and dollar cost averaging now with that said let's talk a little bit quickly about the meme coins and some opportunities in this space Pepe today is up 4.36 and for me this Sparks a little bit of interest because this may mean that the meme coins can go on another run if Pepe does continue to show strength I do believe that Pepe acts as the Bitcoin for the meme market right now in this season that we're in so the way Bitcoin if it moves up we nearly always see other coins like ethereum follow it now we're seeing the same thing with Pepe if Pepe moves down we see the meme coin Market move down Pepe moved sideways we see the meme coins go sideways Pepe moves up we then start to see meme coins go up again so there are two that I want to bring up today one of which I did bring up in my private group This Is MeMe Dao today they sit at a 1.6 million dollar market cap and basically what they are is a meme coin facilitator and they plan to hold buy and distribute meme coins amongst the holders of meme Dao so basically holding this coin will give you access to other meme coins that the community decides to buy and distribute amongst the holders of course this is a meme coin it's super risky we don't know what's gonna happen we can check out the shorter term price action here you can see like a lot of meme coins it did have a very nice initial pump here pushing down to find some support Here and Now what I think is good to see is a slow push upwards a steady growth upwards which could show some potential going forward so definitely go out and check out this coin again I personally hold this in my portfolio and then moving on to another coin that I have spoken about here on the channel before it's magic Sheba starter now this launched very recently right now sitting at a fully diluted market cap of 1.2 million and the circulating market cap is extremely low right now at 150 000 so there is a lot of room for this still to grow you can see a very similar chart here an initial pump downwards finding some support and then heading upwards here something that I like to see essentially what magic Sheba starter are doing is becoming a launch pad on shiberium once aberian goes live they will Bridge the tokens from ethereum which they're currently on over to shiberium and then they'll start to incubate and launch projects directly here and then by holding the coins you get access to different tiers in the launch pad now in the last Bull Run we saw massive returns being involved in launch pads and I do believe that this still shows some opportunity going into the next Bull Run no guarantees especially this is a launch pad mixed with meme coins all right so there's no guarantees here very high risk High reward potential of Investments going to absolute zero but I personally know that I'm still currently holding this in my portfolio as we speak and with that said guys like all of the coins and projects and ecosystems and anything that I hold in my portfolio I plan to take profits all right I'm not one of those influencers who comes out and tells you that I have Diamond hands and I would never sell anything and then later on a couple of months later someone finds out that I've been selling I do take profits so when I get into something early and the price moves up I take profits from it that's how I believe we make money in this market I don't believe in having a hundred percent of my assets in crypto I don't believe in Diamond hands I don't believe in any of that I believe in trying to make as much profit as I possibly can so I can diversify yes into other cryptocurrency projects but also into stocks and shares and of course the property market so that's what I do here on this channel and if you guys do want to stay up to date with that sort of thing I would love for you to join the community by just simply smashing the Subscribe button and I will hopefully see you guys in the next video peace
