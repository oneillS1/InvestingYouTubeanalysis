on a ten thousand dollar account and i would take that thousand dollars that i made and go spend it on something that i wanted i wasn't in the right mindset of growing my account as fast as possible and once we become profitable traders our next mission should be to grow our account as fast as possible for us to be able to quit our day job and start trading for a living which i imagine is your goal i know that was my goal whenever i first started so number two is definitely do not withdraw your money what about number three this is going to sound crazy but add to your account you want to constantly be adding to your account at the beginning when you first become profitable because that's just going to help you get to your goal account size much much faster so adding to your account is obviously a great way to get there and obviously a great way to decrease the amount of time it takes to get to that goal number in your account so you can quit your day job and start trading for a living now what i want to do is take a look at two example traders one who is making the mistake of quitting his day job withdrawing his money and not adding to his account and the other doing the opposite and taking all of these steps in order to increase his account size as fast as possible and we're going to take a look at the comparison of the two returns so on the screen you can see that we have trader a on the left and trader b on the right we're gonna assume that they both have the same exact situation they both have a starting balance of ten thousand dollars they both have a job where they make four thousand dollars their expenses are three thousand we're just using very generalized numbers here and that means that their extra that they have left over at the end of every month is about a thousand dollars and their average return is 10 per month this is the same across the board for trader a and for trader b and the reason i picked most of these numbers is because 50 000 a year is an average income for america 4k a month is around that price around that amount and then 3k a month is average expenses in america so that leaves most people with an extra about thousand dollars at the end of every month if they're budgeting correctly so with this being the case let's take a look at trader a year one trader a takes this ten thousand dollar account turns it to 12 k or gets a 12k return turning his account into a 22k account now he withdraws every month all of his profits so after his first year we're going into year two so trader a quit his day job which means he's having to use all of his trading money which means he's having to withdraw all the money which also means he has no money to add to the trading account so at the end of the year one even though he came out very profitable making a 12k profit he now has to restart with 10 000 what do you think happens in year number two the same exact thing"", ""and it's one of the many useful crypto tools i detailed in a video you can find using the link in the top right after i'm done checking the news and any upcoming crypto milestones i take a look at a handful of sentiment analysis indicators and on-chain metrics for sentiment analysis i check the fear and greed indexes for the stock market and the crypto market on a daily basis and the google search trends for cryptocurrency bitcoin and other altcoins every few days naturally google search trends provides a pretty clear picture of just how much interest there is in a cryptocurrency at any given time the peak of the google search trends for these terms have historically mirrored the previous tops which is of course going to be useful once we start heading back in a bullish direction however because google search trends only updates periodically i use the fear and greed index indicators to get a better sense of how the market is feeling in the short term these indicators are updated every day and their short term historical data helps give an idea of how much influence macro and micro world events could be having on the crypto market as i mentioned in my video about sentiment analysis the fear and greed index for the stock market is often a leading indicator for what we're about to see in the crypto market again this is because cryptocurrencies are risky investments if the stock market starts to see fear chances are the crypto market will start to drop as nervous investors pull out of their riskiest investments and that cell pressure translates to fear in the crypto market as far as on-chain metrics go the only ones i check on a daily basis are the amount of btc held by whales and the amount of btc held on exchanges both of these indicators can be found on glass node if i can see that whales are continuing to accumulate btc like they are now it means that i can take any bearish articles i read earlier with a grain of salt similarly if the amount of btc on exchanges is falling in the long term this supply squeeze will inevitably result in a price pump in this case it seems that btc is moving on to exchanges in the short term which explains the crash we saw at the beginning of last week now if you're wondering which on-chain metrics i check less frequently these are the bitcoin thermo cap bitcoin hodl waves and newpo indicator which can also be found on glassnode i believe that these three combined do a pretty good job of predicting market tops but when we're nowhere near the top there's not much point in checking them since their positions are pretty predictable the next thing i check is social media specifically twitter"", ""right Charlie doesn't understand technology he's 99 years old and still is making better technology plays than Raul pal you all are getting distracted

to starve to bring down the demand on the food supply chain thus the FED at best has a very very indirect impact on food prices the FED has to go and nuke three or four other areas of the economy for food prices to go down at all one of the best ways to bring down the price of food is to bring down the price of energy and the best way to bring down the price of energy is to Nuke the entire manufacturing sector which depends on energy and bids up the price is to Nuke overall economic activity which is transported using energy and hope and pray that those pricing decreases trickle over to the food segment as we know energy commodity prices set the price for fertilizers and of course set the price for transportation of food which then gets baked into the final retail price that you pay at the grocery store the other issue driving inflation right now is the presence of heightening labor costs because of the still tight job market many employers are raising pay to attract and hold more workers holding workers for longer even if they don't need them because they're worried that if they fire them and demand picks up to three months from now they won't be able to hire anybody with the same qualifications back and job openings in September Rose alongside wages and economists are expecting October's report to show another Advance forward in wages which is not a good sign from a labor cost standpoint and suggests a lot more sticky inflation the U.S employment cost index is rising at a five percent annual clip and obviously we all want workers to do better and better and become more and more productive and make more and more money but from the fed's perspective this is a massive massive fail if they don't see employees getting destroyed they're not going to believe inflation is over and they're going to continue trying to destroy them with Rising borrowing costs pretty soon borrowing costs are going to be so high that if you take out a dollar you're gonna have to pay a hundred bucks in yearly interest and Biden's going to be like come on man the economy strong as hell fact of the matter is folks that if labor costs are going up that means that this inflation battle is prolonged folks the FED has two simple mandates to promote price stability to promote maximum employ appointment and a third unofficial one is to promote and induce widespread hemorrhoids in the American population which of course is just an inevitable result of the financial constipation that the FED causes quite frankly the lower this unemployment is the more Firepower that the FED has to unleash in order to promote its price stability goal and it's also true that at the same time keep in mind that this unemployment rate that they look at is very very misleading in and of itself if somebody looks at this they might be fooled into believing that all the jobs here are equal in quality in reality this rate does not it does not discriminate between full-time and part-time jobs or temporary or long-term jobs or if employers have a job that matches their skill set and full earning capacity if you have a surgeon working at a minimum wage job well if they can't find a job as a surgeon this unemployment rate does not take that into consideration even if every single person in this economy was working a sub-optimal job and was very unproductive at it the unemployment rate would still be virtually around but that doesn't actually say anything about the health of the economy you have to look at a lot of different factors not just this one static rate which is very much curved in favor of the government and policy makers which is a huge problem because when policy makers at the FED use this to gauge their decisions on how much they're going to raise rates or how healthy the economy is well all of a sudden the data that they're relying on isn't even real another thing which the unemployment rate is famous for is that it doesn't include everyone who doesn't have a job which means that the real unemployment rate is much higher just if you included the people that don't have a job you'd think"", ""so over the last month i've researched hundreds of different companies and this is my list of stocks i think should be on your watch list i encourage you to watch until the end to get my full analysis on each of these companies i'll go over key numbers recent news and why i expect them to grow in the long term now the housing market has entered what might be a small recession with some analysts calling it a potential repeat of the 2008 recession meanwhile inflation rates have reached historic highs and these price increases have compelled the federal reserve to raise interest rates of course nobody fully knows what's going to happen next but the best thing that you can do is just stay updated on the news and just dollar cost average into the market anyways let's get started so the first document we're talking about today is american express stock ticker axp amex is a multinational corporation well known for its payment card services so right now one share of axp is trading at 154 dollars in two cents with a 52-week low of 134.12 cents and a 52-week high of 199.55 cents if we take a look at the one-year price chart you can see that one year ago we were trading about 170 dollars per share we've seen some ups and some downs as well as hitting an all-time high of about 200 a share but since then it has corrected a little bit with a small recovery recently we have a market cap of 115.4 billion dollars a p ratio of 15.75 earnings per share of 9.78 and they do pay a small dividend of 1.35 percent yahoo finance has it listed as near fair value and if you take a look at the evaluation measures we can see that we have a five year expected peg ratio of 1.33 and a price book ratio of 4.91 the current profit margin is 15.86 percent and we have a return equity of 31.2 which is very strong this is on revenues of 47.96 billion dollars in the last 12 months and looking at their balance sheet they have total cash of 25.19 billion dollars with a strong current ratio of 1.63 their current dividend payout ratio is 19.43 now it's always interesting to see what analysts have to say so on a scale of one to five one being a strong buy and five being a sell analysts are rating amex as a 2.3 meaning it is a buy and the average analyst price target is 170 and 52 cents which is about 20 higher than the current price of 154 dollars in two cents so a recent report revealed the change in credit card spending among american express users with rapid increases in spending for airlines lodging and restaurants this is the first summer in years where the global market isn't significantly hindered by potential outbreaks and the result is a consumer market hungry for travel and spending now one of the biggest benefactors of this market boom will be credit card companies such as american express and we can see these benefits play out in the financials of the company amex recently announced second quarter earnings where the financial services company report a 31 year-over-year increase in total revenues net of interest expense we also can't ignore the fact that the company's total network volume grew by a whopping 28 year-over-year which indicates an increase in consumer usage and spending of their services steven squarey the ceo of american express expressed his confidence in amex's financial performance within a financial recession if one was going to happen he made it very clear that he didn't see a recession happening anytime soon in amex's earnings results really reflect confidence and durability in the company's ability to do business given the economic fears that many consumers have right now it would be more than reasonable to turn to a financial services company that is highly faithful in its own business and the state of the market as a whole overall i think that axp is definitely worth checking out the next stock on the list is umh properties stock ticker umh umh properties is a public real estate investment trust with a portfolio of well over 20 000 developed home sites throughout 10 states in america here you guys can see that one share of umh is trading at 21 and 31 cents with the 52 week low of 16 and 50 cents and a 52 week high of 27 and 50 cents here we have the one year price chart showing a relatively stable price between twenty two dollars and fifty cents and twenty seven dollars but a few months ago we did see a pretty big correction in the price of the stock followed by a swift recovery they have a market cap of one point one five six billion dollars a p ratio of a hundred six point five five which is very high earnings per share of 20 cents and they pay a great dividend of 3.75 looking at their valuation measures we see a price sales ratio of 5.59 and a price to book ratio of 3.75 their profit margin is currently 21.45 percent they have a return equity of 6.16 percent and this is on revenues of 188.71 million dollars in the last year look at their balance sheet we have total cash of 292.46 million dollars and a current ratio of 22.36 ants right now are writing it as a 1.7 meaning it is buy and the average analyst price target is 26.50 which is just over 20 higher than the current price of 21.31 all right so umh properties recently closed a deal acquiring yet another manufactured home community in erie michigan called hidden creek through the deal umh added another 351 developed home sites to its portfolio these home sites take up nearly 90 acres and are over 60 percent occupied so this recent acquisition shows that umh still has the means and the mindset to grow and expand its portfolio and satisfy its investors another way of assessing the credibility of this reit is by looking at who owns the stock if we look at the distribution of shareholders we can see that the vast majority of uma shareholders are institutional investors indicating that umh has high credibility amongst the biggest investors in the market this is definitely reassuring for retail investors like us but some of you are probably wondering why i encourage investing in the real estate investment trust when there is a big question mark in the housing market right now so first off reits tend to perform really well at the stage in the economic cycle with this graph in killing a 1700 percent return from reits since the late 80s but another attractive feature of umh is its dividend payments at the beginning of july umh declared common and preferred dividends with a quarterly cash dividend of 20 cents per share payable to shareholders at the close of business on august 15 2022."", ""[Music] smash the like button all right in all seriousness so far we've established that looking at consumer spending is one of the most important things when trying to figure out if we're going to be in a recession if consumer spending is strong that alone is generally speaking enough to keep the economy from slipping into a recession if consumers are spending money we can avoid a recession if consumers stop spending money then a recession is almost inevitable but the thing about consumer spending is that it's dictated by two very important things access to debt and incomes now anyone has access to debt but technically because interest rates are still really high between five and five point two five percent access to cheap debt is not actually here so that decreases consumer spending the second thing are of course incomes now according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics the real income is measured against inflation is up 0.1 percent ever so slightly month to month but the real real income is down half a percent when compared to from April last year to April this year now when incomes go down people become more budget conscious in February 2023 survey four out of five consumers said they were tightening budgets by buying Less in bulk or shopping around more often for better deals these sorts of micro decisions have a huge influence on the pace of economic growth I'm feeling it when it comes to food which is so weird for me because I've never really concerned myself with how much food costs and when people start to feel the price of basic necessities like food go up interesting things start to happen with their savings check this out this graph shows American Consumer savings now the red line represents the trend of where savings are but the Blue Line represents their actual savings and you can see that at the height of the pandemic savings went up to a peak of roughly 33 percent thanks to all the stimulus but after Q4 of 2021 savings started to go down below the red trend line and in Q2 of 2022 the savings rate reached the lowest point and all of that happened to perfectly coincide with inflation that's exactly when it reached its peak of nine percent in June of 2022 but now that inflation is coming down we can see that the savings rate is slowly starting to come back up but there's a huge catch that's a huge catch the card and fan you know how hard this is I'm an idiot I'm sorry the huge catch is that the data is actually showing people of higher disposable incomes but people with lower disposable incomes are being affected the most and that's why they're tapping into the Forbidden Shadow realm of credit card debt the economists believe that people with less money may turn to credit to cover expenses in this economy I think it's really scary how much people are using credit to be able to afford what they need to have every day that sentiment shows up in this data set from the Bank of America Institute and you can see from this data that people making fifty thousand dollars or less are utilizing the most amount in credit card debt and this is really important to look at because it helps us better understand how this consumer spending is being funded and that will help us better understand how bad the recession could get for the average consumer because are people spending money they already have from their savings accounts or are they borrowing money to do it during the pandemic for example people didn't need to borrow money because they were getting help from the government with all this stimulus but now that the stimulus is gone data shows people started to borrow more but that trend is starting to reverse at the end of 2022 the average household had nearly ten thousand dollars in credit card debt analysts believe that Nationwide credit card debt May soon reach one trillion dollars an all-time high putting everyday expenses on credit is so very dangerous because we know that as interest rates have been rising so have rates on credit cards so is the interest that you're paying on that money that you are indeed borrowing to pay for everyday expenses that's right and now is arguably the worst time to borrow on credit to buyer Essentials especially if you carry a balance when interest rates have reached an all-time high of 20 credit card interest rates have never been higher topping 20 Nationwide in February these interest rates move up and down depending on the central bank's federal funds rate and these rates are generally only charged to customers who carry a monthly balance by the way that part of cnbc's video is sort of inaccurate so side tangent here it's kind of important remember the Federal Reserve does not set credit card interest rates based on the federal funds rate it kind of does""]"

I'm willing to take on one property with such a large amount of money from their fifth you should never buy real estate with money that you need short term the one report from Forbes found that it takes an average of five to seven years just to break even on a property purchase once you account for the cost of buying owning and selling and if that sounds absurd just consider this if you buy a home for three hundred thousand dollars most likely you'll pay an addition additional six thousand dollars in closing costs insurance and fees from there you're also going to be responsible for all the miss the business expenses that come with owning a home like property taxes insurance premiums repairs random things that you'd never think about that just comes up out of nowhere which let's just say averages to three thousand dollars a year that means to break even on the property after five years you'd have to sell that property for three hundred and forty thousand dollars or a thirteen percent increase just to be left with three hundred and nineteen thousand dollars after all of your closing costs which is enough to compensate you just for the cost of buying selling and owning a property to begin with now yes of course real estate does tend to Trend upwards over time but that's not guaranteed so if you're looking for a quick way to make cash most likely this is not going to work in your favor that's why I always recommend to only buy a property that you intend on keeping for the next seven to ten years that way your chances of breaking even are significantly higher and maybe you'll even turn a profit and six the same thing could also be said about buying a property without having enough cash saved up from my experience purchasing eight properties over the last 12 years it is so important that you have enough money saved up for all all planned Renovations plus 25 because you know it's going over budget and have enough to pay for all property expenses for at least three to six months otherwise I promise you're going to be running into a situation where you have a two thousand dollar repair you'll have to put it on a credit card and you'll be scrambling to pay it down as fast as possible to avoid the high interest rates or a tenant moves out and it's four thousand dollars to fix the walls once it's empty for another few months while you try to find another tenant who pays less than expected because National rents are dropping I know it sounds excessive or fear-mongery but trust me it happens all the time and it's something to be prepared for however one of the easiest ways to soften the blow is just to plan for it ahead of time and assume it's gonna happen what I personally do is just keep a checking account for every single property that I have and no matter what I always keep four to six months worth of expenses in there at all times for anything that comes up once the amount exceeds that level I'll transfer it over to invested elsewhere it's that easy it's really simple that way anytime there's a repair there's money sitting on the sidelines that's accounted for for that exact purpose I keep it simple and it doesn't need to be complicated and finally for all of you Real Estate Investors out there do not pick a bad tenant or the first person who offers you the most amount of money I'll give you two personal stories that I've had to deal with my first was all the way back in 2012 where I picked the first 10 in new calls at the time I was desperate for money I had sunk everything I had into Renovations I had nothing left to fall back on so I just accepted it within six months he stopped paying he trashed the place and I had to go through with an eviction by the time I actually got him out it cost me about four months of lost rent eight thousand dollars in Damages and another few thousand dollars in eviction fees that was more than an entire Year's worth of profit just lost because I happened to pick a very bad tenant I've also witnessed other tenants who I like to call Professional tenants who simply put up the bare minimum to move in and then they stopped paying and they know that it's going to take them anywhere between 3 to 12 months to actually get evicted so they just Bank the money instead the point being from all of this is that you have to be very very picky because essentially what you're doing is entering into a business contract with a complete stranger for the next one to two years and you need to make sure that you both have clear expectations and can communicate with each other in terms of what each of you expect now overall though since then for the last 10 years I've been really fortunate to have amazing tenants and they credit that to picking the person not the price I typically do not take the highest offer I just want somebody who stays there long term is really nice to work with pays on time and treats the place as it's their own that's all that's why I'm never in a rush it's always better to find the right person than get the highest price I'm doing all of this I truly believe you're going to be in a much stronger position to buy or invest in real estate throughout these next few years even if the market continues to decline my personal philosophy is that there's always good deals out there even if they take longer to find and by investing aggressively for the long term you're going to put yourself in the best position possible to make as much money as possible"", ""all right so next fourth you should not buy a property if you have not factored in the transaction cost of buying and selling a house throughout the last two years it just seems like there's this mindset of buying a home getting to live there and then being able to sell it for a massive profit since prices keep going up but unfortunately this is the part of real estate that so many people don't think about until they're in the middle of a deal see as a renter it's so easy to fill out an application usually for free and you're done but when you're buying and selling this could often be a very expensive process that could cost you anywhere between four to seven percent of the home's value right off the bat like when you're buying a home you're gonna have to pay for inspections escrow charges loan origination fees and transaction costs not to mention a whole bunch of other miscellaneous charges that come up throughout the transaction like transfer taxes notary fees filing fees coordination transfer tax document certification fees it's just too many fees for me to talk about here without losing track of what i was talking about between all of this you could easily expect to pay anywhere from one to two and a half percent of the home's purchase price just for the opportunity of being able to buy so if you're purchasing something for three hundred thousand dollars expect to pay an extra three thousand to seventy five hundred dollars up front just for the privilege of getting to call at home in addition to that the transaction cost of selling is often significantly higher when everything is said and done selling a home could easily cost you another four to six percent of the home's value from start to finish that means just to break even on the purchase you're gonna have to sell your home seven percent higher than what you paid for it otherwise you'll have to pay out of pocket for those transaction costs now of course if you bought your home throughout the last few years then most likely this is not going to be a problem and you're probably sitting on a lot of profit congratulations but the future of home appreciation is not guaranteed and even though things look good with low inventory and strong demand there is a chance that the market could soften that's why i don't recommend buying a home unless you have a good idea how long you're going to be living there for and have taken into account the transaction cost of buying and selling and fifth because of that you shouldn't be buying a home unless you plan to keep it at least five to seven years that's because the shorter you plan to keep your home for the riskier it becomes that you'll make money by owning it things like transaction costs insurance repairs and maintenance are non-recoupable costs that you will not get back so you'll need to expect the property values will continue to rise to offset that expense to make buying worth it like on a 400 000 home over three years you could very well expect to pay a four thousand dollar closing cost when buying seventy eight hundred dollars a year in property taxes insurance and repairs and a twenty thousand dollar expense when selling that's forty seven thousand four hundred dollars worth of overhead and that doesn't even include your mortgage interest which could push that number even further that's why generally the break-even point for most homeowners is probably going to be somewhere between five and seven years and in almost all situations the longer you keep your home for the more likely you are to end up making money it's also important to mention that these last two years have been a complete anomaly when it comes to the housing market and it would be impossible for prices to keep rising at the same trajectory it's just not going to happen so my recommendation is if you're looking to buy a home that you're only planning on keeping for a few years it's probably not a good idea unless you're specifically going in with the intention of renovating it and flipping it for a quick profit renting it out in the future or you can handle the risk that maybe in the short term you're not gonna break even right away and six you should not buy a home if you don't have at least three to six months of your home's expenses saved up in cash at all times just like financial experts recommend you keep a three to six month emergency fund i recommend a home emergency fund that covers three to six months of your mortgage payments property taxes maintenance and anything else just in case something inevitably breaks or there's an unexpected bill outside of your control it's really important to recognize that everything in a property has a lifespan where eventually it'll need to be repaired or replaced for example roofs usually last 15 to 25 years water heaters last 10 to 15 years ac units last 10 to 15 years garbage disposals last a few days and so on and once you begin to average all of this costs throughout the course of your home ownership you'll begin to realize it adds up very very quickly on top of that most people are not fully aware that the cost of materials labor and wait times have increased substantially throughout the last two years so it could be quite a shock when you see what a 2022 repair bill looks like when you've compared that with what it used to look like back in the olden days"", ""and it's usually a combination of both in fact even though you might think that this only applies to investors homeowners do this all the time when they blindly walk into a property being completely unprepared for things to break the moment they close or even worse they didn't realize that they could have just rented the home for a fraction of the price and then waited to find a better deal on something else so from my 15 years of experience in real estate having sold over 130 million dollars worth of homes and I was working full-time as an agent I will tell you with 100 certainty expect that every repair you do is probably going to go over budget so when you're planning a renovation and you're trying to do the calculations to determine the end value just assume you're going to spend 25 percent more than you plan to I don't need to see the numbers I don't need to know how reliable your contractor is it just happens every time in addition to that it's also incredibly common for new home buyers to magically forget about all the minor day-to-day annoyances that begin to add up over time like insurance payments Landscaping utilities that run more than expected property tax increases and regular maintenance that you would never think about until you own a home all of this can easily add up to an extra few hundred dollars a month that nobody thinks or talks about until they've already owned the home for longer than a year that's why it's so incredibly important that you know how to evaluate a property understand how much it's going to cost to renovate add in a margin of error include miscellaneous expenses and realistically know how much the property is going to rent for otherwise it could be stuck with a property that costs too much to own with zero profit and without the potential rental income to cover your costs if needed a third another common mistake out there is to make sure that you do not take on too much debt now don't get the wrong idea because this can't be okay if you're safely making enough to cover the cost of the payments or you get a low enough interest rate but the problem arises where you take on too much debt to the point where you become entirely reliant on rental income a strong housing market or a strong job market to continue sustaining those payments without anything else to fall back on the fact is unless you have the income and the savings to carry through that Mortgage in the event of a loss of income or a job loss you could go broke really really quick just look at what happened in 2008 when people took out too large of a loan and couldn't write out the drop in prices in a way that's beginning to happen again now for those who have not already logged in their interest rates as prices Begin to Fall across the country the last thing you'd want to happen is that you can't make your payments you can't rent out the property at a high enough price to offset your costs and you can't sell because you owe more than what it's worth that's why I typically recommend coming in with a 20 to 25 percent down payment for anything that you purchase so that way you have a bit of a buffer to fall back on just in case fourth speaking of loans I would personally stay away from short-term or adjustable rate mortgages unless you really understand what you're doing the problem I see today is that it's cheaper to take the short-term adjustable rate mortgage than it is to take the 30-year fixed especially with the mindset that the FED is going to U-turn in lower interest rates in Q4 of 2024 because they'll have to do however this is not guaranteed""]"

the world i realized that but today because i know that tough love is important and these are things that you need to know and look out for what we're going to be talking about in this video is the top three signs that any trader will fail and not be profitable you see any problem that you have in your trading is going to break down into three very simple categories you either have a problem with your strategy meaning you're trading a strategy that does not make money over time or you're not trading a rules-based strategy so therefore you're constantly switching strategies or being confused about when you're actually supposed to place trades you have too much subjectivity all of that would fall under the category of being a strategy issue and that is category number one category number two that any trader that it wants to be profitable must master and that anyone that pushes aside will fail at trading is risk management in this case you maybe you have a strategy that proves to make money over time you put in the work on the strategy but your risk management's bad and for that reason you're consistently becoming too emotional while in trade you're moving your stop loss taking targets off early you're incapable of sticking to your plan because you're risking too much or even worse than that you're risking so much that you blow an account before you give your strategy time to actually make money those things would fall under the category of a risk management problem or you have a discipline problem where the other two are set but for some reason you're either too greedy or impatient or something is wrong in the disciplined area where you cannot stay disciplined to a risk management plan that keeps you out of your emotions and keeps you from blowing your account and you can't stay disciplined to a strategy that gives you an edge over the market those are the only three categories that you can actually have a problem in there's no other area of trading as a technical trader so right now just understand that the top three signs of any trader that will fail is the fact that they either have a strategy problem a risk management problem or a discipline problem and the reason i break it down into those three categories and as simple as possible is because it just makes it so much more easy to understand and kind of dissect what you're doing wrong if you're not quite making profit so now what i want to do is jump over to the whiteboard and discuss all three of these areas and what you can do to solve the issues you're having in those areas so i do this through something i call the triangle of trading success which you may have heard of before i'm gonna draw that out yo yo before we keep going i just wanted to jump in here real quick and say if you're enjoying this content we come out with content like this each and every week so do me a favor go ahead and click that subscribe button down below the video if you're not already if you already are awesome thank you very much click that like button for me we're going to jump back in see you guys there this is an example of the triangle of trading success let's make it a little bigger and this triangle trading success in the middle of it are all the traders that are currently profitable and where you want to be in order to get there you must first master a strategy that is rules based that you can actually follow that's not subjective and we call that an objective strategy you must master a strategy that not only is objective but also actually makes money the way i create strategies like this is something i call c e s t"", ""we have our conditions met of moving average area of value combined with our area of structure we have our entry met with a long Wicked candle followed by buying pressure for a bullish trade we have our stop in place and our Target in place this is where I would actually place the trade if I click play you'll see that price did eventually push up high enough to hit our Target anything I tell you about trading psychology will be completely useless unless you have mastered what I'm about to tell you if you have not mastered the basics of whatever Market you're trading in if you have not mastered either technical analysis or fundamental analysis or both whatever you decide to trade based on and if you have not mastered creating a strategy that's rules based enough for you to stick to and proven to be profitable over time along with mastered risk management then I can speak for hours about trading psychology and it will help you zero because until you've mastered those four things nothing I say about trading psychology is going to help you in any way shape or form so if you are currently at the position where you you don't have a Mastery level understanding of the basics of the market you're trading in or you haven't mastered technical slash fundamental analysis or both and you don't have a strategy that's rules based that you're sticking to and you don't have a risk management plan then you need to work on all of that and then come back to learning about trading psychology feel free to stick around through this lesson but understand that nothing about trading psychology is going to be applicable until you master those other four parts of your training after you have those things mastered trading psychology and discipline can still be a bit difficult and this is where this little hack comes into play so many Traders see themselves as bad or inadequate based on the results of a single trade or a single week you may go out and lose two or three trades in a row and think of yourself as inadequate as a Trader think of yourself as a as a loser in the markets for lack of better terms and think about this whenever you last joined a signal service if you ever have what if they sent you two signals in a row and they were both losing trades have you ever gotten that and been like oh this guy absolutely sucks at trading obviously he doesn't win he just lost two trades in a row if you have don't worry you're not alone when I was starting out that's what I thought too when in reality that person may be a good Trader but they just had two losses in a row they may not be a good Trader I know some signal services are a bit sketchy but the point here is no matter how skilled you become no one will ever know what the Market's going to do at a specific moment no matter how much skill you acquire at trading you're not going to know what price is going to do on one specific trade as I learned from Mark Douglas our ability to be profitable relies on our ability to understand and accept that we are trading based on a statistic advantage that plays out over a large sample size of Trades so although we can't predict exactly what the Market's going to do with a hundred percent accuracy right now we can make a very high likelihood assumption based on a large sample size of Trades and a predictable pattern that is proven to be profitable over time otherwise known as a strategy so to make this very clear as a professional Trader I am not trading based on what I know the Market's going to do next I am trading based on a statistic advantage that plays out over a large number of Trades you will be trading when you are profitable not based on what you know the market will do no matter how skilled you are you will never know what the market will do at that exact moment but what you will be trading based on when you become profitable is a statistic advantage that plays out over a large sample size and for me that sample size is about 100 trades so what I do is I pay attention to my trading based on a sample size of 100 trades I don't look at it going"", ""and i'm sure your situation is very similar now with that in mind there are measurable things that we have to have in order to create a wealthy trading career some of those measurable parts of a wealthy trading career would be our roi the return on investment we can definitely measure that throughout the year and see how we're doing it's a great indication of whether we are trading correctly or trading not correctly are we making money or not making money the roi is measurable the second thing we can measure is our probabilities which would sound like probabilities spelled it weird whatever which would be how often are we winning versus when we're losing what is that winning percentage we're winning at 50 60 what's our risk to reward ratio the third thing that we can measure is our risk management and although all three of these things are wildly important these measurable aspects of our trading are not all we need and the one thing that every trader that wants to become wealthy must have does not fall under these categories although yes you will have to have each of them the one thing we're going to talk about in today's video though is something that is hardly ever discussed and what that is is mental and emotional toughness if you do not have mental and emotional toughness there's no way you can create any kind of wealth in trading what i want to do in today's video is share with you three ways that you can become more mentally and emotionally tough in your trading welcome to another blackboard lesson we'll roll the disclaimer really quickly and we'll jump right in see you in a second welcome back to another blackboard lesson guys and what is the first thing we have to do in order to improve mental and emotional toughness well just as with any other experiment you need a constant and what i mean by that is we need to figure out what is your pain tolerance if we don't have a place to start then we cannot improve and we can't even examine our emotional toughness our mental and emotional toughness so what you have to do here is figure out how much pain can you actually tolerate before you become emotional before you start to overreact or make bad decisions based on emotions instead of logic and the way we do this is just by asking ourselves simple questions the way i like to do this especially in terms of the aspect of trading is what would you be willing to risk what would you be willing to lose how much pain could you withstand going through on your account before you started to act emotional let's just do an example here and say you have a ten thousand dollar account would you be willing to risk two hundred dollars of that account every time you place a trade would you only be willing to risk 100 and then start getting emotional what is your opinion right now on this exact scenario and if you don't have a ten thousand dollar account or one thousand dollar account a one hundred dollar account it does not matter what the starting balance is ask yourself what amount of money you'd be comfortable losing and then you have to test that theory and see how comfortable you are actually losing that money and i'm not saying go out and try this i'm not saying go out and lose 200 to see if you're okay with losing two hundred dollars but you have to somehow see what your tolerance is once you find that pain tolerance in order to increase your mental and emotional toughness it is your job to stay within that pain tolerance so let's say your pain tolerance allows for losses up to 100 per trade based on your specific financial situation if you're willing to risk 100 per trade then that means that is your pain tolerance and that's where you need to stay the way you do that is with risk management risk management is going to allow you to stay within that pain tolerance which is going to in turn increase your mental and emotional toughness number two is preparation i want you to think about giving a very important speech to a huge crowd of people just in general you have to have a lot of emotional and mental focus and toughness in order to do something like that right now i want you to imagine doing it with absolutely no preparation you just get up on stage and start talking about whatever subject they give you that sounds terrifying to me and i imagine it sounds terrifying to you as well and it should be because another way to improve your mental and emotional toughness is to prepare now i want you to think about that same exact situation except now you've taken time to prepare for this moment over the past four weeks you have a speech memorized completely you have bullet points down in case you get lost at any point and you're completely prepared for this speech how much less nervous are you going to be right so the way we attack preparation is to wait for it prepare and the way we prepare comes down to back testing same as with that speech you go into the markets no preparation whatsoever you're just clicking buy and sell randomly because you want to make money and the only way to make money is to be in trades so you get in a lot of trades you start to lose you're not using good risk management so instead of just losing a hundred dollars you lose a thousand dollars this is the cycle of doom that happens to so many new and struggling traders and that's something i want to help you avoid with this video so preparation is a key part in creating mental and emotional toughness in our trading i want you to think about being in a ufc fight not physically like a metaphorical ufc fight so you're in that fight and you don't have your hands up your hands are down the whole time you have no defense you're not using head movement whatsoever how many times are you gonna get punched and how many of those punches is it going to take for you to just get knocked out depends on who you're fighting but i would imagine not very many you're probably getting knocked out very soon using risk management and having this mental and emotional toughness using back testing preparing for these types of situations is our defense that is us with our hands up using head movement parries we are using those things whenever we're in this metaphorical ufc fight if we have a mental and emotional toughness by correctly using risk management and preparing through the process of back testing that's your defense that's your hands up when the market's coming at you and that's something that is absolutely necessary and finally number three is do not over react overreacting is something that gets traders into trouble all the time but the reason they overreact ironically is because the first two steps have not been taken ninety percent of time if someone overreacts it's because they don't have a good risk management plan so they're moving their stop loss up or taking the trade off when they're in a little bit of a loss or taking their trade off when they're just a little bit in profit instead of following their trading plan they're overreacting by switching strategies when they've only lost two or three trades using one strategy they're overreacting because they have not prepared by doing back testing and having that risk management plan to follow so simply put the way you keep from overreacting is by following the other rules i'm going to put follow other steps fos you follow the other steps and that keeps you from overreacting and with these three things i promise you you will greatly improve your mental and emotional toughness which is one thing that every trader that is wealthy has and that if you ever plan to be a wealthy trader someone who's able to quit their job by trading in the forex market stock market whatever financial market you're in someone that eventually grows massive wealth from trading in financial markets without mental and emotional toughness that will be impossible but if you do master this you take the three steps i've shown you in this video then you have a greater chance a much greater chance you're almost inevitably going to have increased and appropriate mental and emotional toughness in your trading that was another

4,3,260,3_tesla_teslas_ford_tesla stock,"['tesla', 'teslas', 'ford', 'tesla stock', 'cars', 'vehicles', 'stock', 'elon', 'musk', 'model']","[""five being a sell analysts are writing tesla as a 2.3 meaning it is a buy and right now the average analyst price target is 306 dollars and 10 cents which is a few percent over the current price of 288 dollars and nine cents so since thursday tesla stock has been much much cheaper due to a three for one stock split after the closing bell on wednesday this is beneficial for retail investors because now it's much more easy to own at least one share of the stock meanwhile investors who've held onto stock for a long time will still retain the same value that they originally had in the company they'll just have three times as many shares with each share at a lower price tesla stock split is also bullish news because it indicates how well the company is doing for shares to be really expensive per share that it must cut down stock price to bring in more investors is an awesome sign and tesla being known as the innovator in ev manufacturing has set shock waves throughout the rest of the auto industry recently ford laid off 3 000 employees just to cut costs as the company transitions to ev and based on the company's most recent earnings report which occurred during the middle of last month we can definitely see why tesla is now the face and model of the automobile industry the company's revenues increased year over year by around 42 to 16.9 billion dollars while the company's gross profits increased year over year by around 47 to 4.2 billion dollars and there are plenty of reasons to anticipate more growth but the biggest reason is the arrival of more eevee battery manufacturing in america specifically panasonic is considering another large-scale u.s battery cell factory which could bode very well for ev companies especially tesla who have been relying on china's manufacture and export of ev batteries for a long time hopefully having more eevee battery manufacturing in america would cut costs increase convenience improve logistics and also bring more business into the country which would be a huge benefit yielded by tesla's innovation i think tesla's always going to be an overpriced company but it's definitely a very interesting company and stock has performed really well throughout the last few years"", ""but if they're stuttering a little bit on their ev rollout with the truck maybe they won't be the leader in ev pickup trucks that they hope to be so i would just caution investors not to just look at their production delivery numbers but also look at the customer reception of their cars ford is projecting for between 10 and 15 of total vehicle production growth in 2022 and north america just continues to be by far the most profitable segment in fact they've lost money in their other major geographies now they did say that they're improving kind of their manufacturing process and roll out those geographies so they should improve this year but again they expect i think a 10 margin in north america which is really impressive the big thing with ford is that they are continuing to grow profit and earn a ton of free cash flow while investing in evs which is a really really big theme that i think makes ford one of the best all-around ev stocks to buy because what it essentially is doing which is something that disney did with disney plus that meta platforms is doing with its metaverse rollout that oil and gas companies are doing with renewable energy investments is it's taking this core business and then allocating extra profits to grow this entirely new business and that's a really big advantage than having to raise more money or go to capital markets for debt which is very challenging in a time of higher interest rates like we are now so ford really doesn't have that problem because it can bankroll its ev business with its ice business so that's just something to really keep in mind kind of how will its margins eventually take a hit probably not in 2022 but maybe in 2023 and 2024 when they bring that ev capacity up to 600 000 vehicles per year i would just be curious to see how that impacts their profitability another big thing with ford is they reinstated their dividend"", ""and they're going to lean towards leasing out one of their facilities now with that being said guys is this the time to buy Mullins stock I do consider grabbing a small position here early in the month of June may be a great idea but far as jumping off the deep end I would just wait until the announcement that production has started for those chassis ladies and gentlemen now with Mullen actually focusing on this commercial vehicles they will in fact have an edge over these other startup EV companies due to the fact that we all know that these major auto manufacturers has an edge when it comes to getting their cars to the market due to the fact they already have the real estate they already have these dealerships on every single corner and I'm talking about your Chevy dealerships your Buick the list goes on anything under the General Motors umbrella also Ford has car lots everywhere so getting their product to Market is much much faster for these major your auto manufacturers not only that their production capability allows them to sell their cars a little bit cheaper than what these startup EV companies are going to have to deal with also we already know cars sell off of culture and a loyal fan base so for instance a lawyer or a doctor that continues to drive Mercedes-Benz and when they want to convert over to EV now they have their electric Mercedes-Benz available ladies and gentlemen that is why I feel as though that Mullen will not win the war when it comes to general purpose vehicles but with them actually focusing on their commercial side of things that is currently a untapped market and it has huge huge potential we can see these type of things apply to distribution centers ladies and gentlemen warehouses and much much more especially Mullins Battery Technology last year the CEO did make a statement saying that they are in talks with OEM companies about their Battery Technology and we're about the solid polymer State Battery ladies and gentlemen not m-a-e-o and the CEO said they are in talks with Outsourcing that technology to OEM companies and that is the type of companies guys like the electric pallet jacks we might be able to find that Battery Technology in if Mullen wants to Outsource it to them um reach trucks uh forklifts the list goes on guys uh Mullen has a octopus style reach they can actually do a lot of things once this solid polymer State Battery Technology is completely looked over completely reviewed and um and we get all the data and feedback off of that guys I believe that that is going to be mullen's wild card for sure so with that being said guys if you agree with anything I said in this video can you

mining difficulty has also increased the break-even price is now close to 20K anywho the fourth part of the report is about regulations the authors note that U.S politicians are preparing stablecoin regulations which we covered in a recent video and that the G20 is working on a global crypto framework they also touch on the eu's mica crypto regulations which were finally passed just recently I'll quickly note that the financial stability board or FSB will be releasing Global crypto regulation recommendations this summer for context the FSB is an unaccountable and unelected organization closely aligned with U.S interests and it looks like its recommendations will be very anti-crypto now what's awesome is that the authors provide an amazing visualization of mica's key Provisions the most important one is that D5 protocols will not be regulated so long as they are sufficiently decentralized unfortunately the EU seems to be working on D5 specific regulations too make no mistake crypto regulations are required for the next crypto bull run to begin luckily there are many places that are in the process of passing Pro crypto regulations and not just the EU the authors note this in their forecast these crypto regulations will increase crypto's legitimacy and I couldn't help but notice that the authors provided a score for each of these crypto niches surprisingly the scores for Bitcoin defy and Mining were all four out of five not surprisingly the score for regulation is two and this makes me wonder what categories 5 and 1 look like in the eyes of the authors on that note the fifth part of the report is about derivatives which the authors put down as a three out of five they reiterate that the cme's Bitcoin option Futures have hit record levels of open interest they also note that the annualized basis yield for BTC suggests that investors are becoming more uncertain for reference the BTC annualized basis yield quote represents the cost or benefit of holding a long position in Bitcoin Futures and can provide insight into the market sentiment of Futures Traders as you can see this yield has been declining signaling a potentially bearish short-term trend this relates to the author's forecast wherein they note that bullish Traders are betting on btc's price to be 32k at the end of May and bearish Traders are betting on btc's price to be 25k at the end of May specifically the 26th of May the authors note that these were the same targets Traders had last month now I'd be remiss if I didn't mention all the volatility that's being caused by leveraged trading these days if you've been keeping up with our weekly crypto reviews you'll know that long liquidations and short squeezes have been primary drivers of price action in recent weeks and this seems to be getting worse what this means is that you need to be very careful when you're trading and be aware of all the key levels that your favorite cryptos could go to if they pump or dump and if you have no idea what key levels are I suggest subscribing to coin Bureau trading Dan will tell you everything you need to know the link is up in the top right now the sixth part of the report is about venture capital or VC the authors restate that VC investing went up by 170 in April totaling almost 900 million dollars the breakdown of where all that money went can be seen here While most of the deals were in defy most of the money went to infrastructure the authors underscore a whopping 220 million dollar investment in core weave a quote specialized cloud provider however it's not entirely clear if core weave is a crypto project it doesn't seem to have a white paper or token but Ico drops notes that it will be selling an erc20 token soon take note in their forecast the author's cautioned that although the month-over-month increase in VC investing is impressive it's not a trend this can clearly be seen in the infographic they provide crypto VC investing fell off a cliff last year and hasn't yet recovered even so there's still lots of money being thrown around the authors stress that crypto VC investment is heavily dependent on macro factors namely interest rates so long as the FED continues to keep rates High speculative VC investing will be minimal and this further underscores the fact that the crypto projects raising money now are very high quality take note I'll also quickly note that the authors gave this crypto Niche a 4 out of 5 which again begs the question of what a five looks like now the seventh part of the report is about nfts the authors note that quote there are concerns about the nft market going into freefall hence the two out of five rating their evidence for this free fall is the 65 decline in nft sales and the 50 drop in active wallets"", ""hashtag she buttonew good luck now before we get to the main story of today's video let's first talk about some of the latest crypto news today Rishi Sonic becomes UK prime minister he wants to make Britain a global crypto investment hub Rishi Sonic who served as Britain's Chancellor of the exchequer from 2020 to 2022 and chief secretary to the treasury from 2019 to 2022 has become the prime minister of the UK he succeeded Liz truss who resigned after four to four days in office as prime minister Sonic formally accepted his new role from King Charles during a meeting at Buckingham Palace on Monday after winning the conservative party leadership many people have called Sonic Pro crypto for his efforts to make Britain a global hub for crypto assets technology and investment as announced by the UK government in April he said at the time it's my ambition to make the UK a global hub for crypto asset technology and the measures we've outlined today will help to ensure firms can invest innovate and scale up in this country the British government also affirmed that it will see stable coins recognized as a valid form of payment as part of wider plans to make Britain a global hub for crypto asset technology and investment moreover the government noted that it will explore ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system to encourage further development of the crypto asset Market in the UK Sonic also commissioned the Royal Mint to create a non-fungible token we want to see the businesses of tomorrow and the jobs they create here in the UK and by regulating effectively we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term Seneca Pine this is part of our plan to ensure the UK Financial Services industry is always at the Forefront of technology and innovation however the new prime minister is also pro-central Bank digital currencies which has caused concerns among some crypto advocates in October last year he explained how cbtc's could benefit businesses and consumers as the G7 issued report on the subject Sonic also set up a task force to lead the UK's work on a central bank digital currency Central Bank digital currencies are a very controversial topic so let me know what you guys think about them in the comments below if you are still watching it would be massively appreciated if you could go ahead and smash the like button it costs nothing and really helps support the channel also keep watching to find out the cryptocurrency that could completely take over the social media industry now let's get into the main story of today's video some musk officially owns Twitter something that I'm sure lots of people didn't see coming a few months ago but this is one of the biggest business moves in the past 10 years but what does this have to do with a social media cryptocurrency well a couple of months bacolin musk tweeted saying free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle this poll resulted in 70 percent of people saying no illin musk replied to the Tweet saying the consequences of this poll will be important please vote carefully it has been sent before that Twitter has a political bias this was made clear with the Banning of controversial ex-president Donald Trump with lots of people thinking he was unfairly banned due to the fact that Twitter is one of the biggest Platforms in the world it's extremely important that there is no political bias as the power of Twitter could literally control elections now there is no stopping Elon Musk from having his own political bias except there already is a solution completely trackable blockchain algorithms to prove that no opinion is being Shadow banned and hidden from most users on Twitter now what if I told you that there was already a token which is specializing in developing a decentralized social media this token has also raised over 200 million dollars and is backed by Sequoia and recent Horowitz coinbase Ventures Social Capital polishing Capital Winklevoss Capital Pantera and many others this token is called decentralized social ticker diso is musk's endorse's answer for decentralized social blockchain the deso foundation announces the release of its ambitious roadmap to decentralize social media and build the social layer of web 3."", ""but\xa0 there's clearly opposition from many quarters\xa0\xa0 which means that the signing of regulations\xa0 into law may not be a straightforward process\xa0\xa0 however a few days after the select

people to act even more irresponsibly than many\xa0 of them already do that said of course gambling\xa0\xa0 isn't taxed in the UK so if the treasury\xa0 select committee has its way well I'm sure\xa0\xa0 many would be absolutely delighted okay time to\xa0 end this Roundup on a high note by stopping off\xa0\xa0 in Hong Kong as I'm sure you're all aware retail\xa0 trading of cryptocurrencies will become legal in\xa0\xa0 the china-controlled city-state very soon and in\xa0 just a few days time on the 1st of June exchanges\xa0\xa0 there will be able to apply for a license from\xa0 the city's Securities and Futures commission sfc\xa0\xa0 to operate now a few things to be aware of before\xa0 you get too excited first up it looks like only\xa0\xa0 the major cryptos like BTC eth and a few others\xa0 will be accessible to investors in Hong Kong as\xa0\xa0 Bloomberg reported quote individual investors\xa0 can trade larger coins on exchanges licensed by\xa0\xa0 the sfc under Hong Kong's new approach safeguards\xa0 include knowledge tests appropriate risk profiling\xa0\xa0 and reasonable limits on exposure the coins should\xa0 be included in at least two acceptable investable\xa0\xa0 indexes from independent providers one with\xa0 experience in the traditional financial sector\xa0\xa0 now it's unclear which cryptos besides BTC and\xa0 eth meet this criteria but the list is likely to\xa0\xa0 be limited so although retail Traders will be able\xa0 to invest through licensed and heavily regulated\xa0\xa0 exchanges only a handful of larger cryptos will be\xa0 accessible to them and they will likely be heavily\xa0\xa0 vetted by said exchanges in order to satisfy the\xa0 powers that be that they know what they're doing\xa0\xa0 so don't count on a flood of inexperienced newbies\xa0 piling into ship on the 1st of June in other words\xa0\xa0 now of course the really big question here is\xa0 just how much pent-up Chinese money is going to\xa0\xa0 find its way into the crypto market via Hong Kong\xa0 China is notorious for its strict Capital controls\xa0\xa0 and the CCP will not be Keen to see a flight\xa0 from the Yuan to BTC eth and others inflows\xa0\xa0 from the mainland are likely to be restricted and\xa0 closely monitored that said this could well Mark\xa0\xa0 the beginning of a pivot towards crypto by China\xa0 as it looks to capitalize on the US's rejection of\xa0\xa0 the industry as I and many others have been saying\xa0 the next Bull Run could well begin in the East and\xa0\xa0 so we need to watch what happens in Hong Kong over\xa0 the coming weeks and months very closely but let's\xa0\xa0 leave the last word on this to Mr binance himself\xa0 CZ on the 24th of May he tweeted quote CCTV China\xa0\xa0 central television just broadcasted""]"

cover all of the bases when it comes to etf investing number one they have automated dividend reinvestment number two they automatically rebalance your portfolio as you add more money or earn dividends so as the different allocations or stocks or funds within your portfolio change the new money going in is going to put you back to your target as close as possible and third and finally with fractional shares you can remain fully invested which is really cool in addition they offer dozens of pre-built portfolios that own low fee etfs from top providers like vanguard invesco etc and those are completely free of any management fees m1 finance is totally commission free and if you guys want to check them out my affiliate link is ryanoscribner.com m1-finance or you can check them out in my description down below i also have a completely free 30-minute step-by-step video training that's going to walk you through how to get started with m1 finance that's going to be down in the description below as well so coming in at number four on the list here is another fidelity etf this is fbcv the fidelity blue chip value etf now this is another actively managed fidelity fund meaning there is a team of professionals doing the research and then deciding what the actual assets are so these fund managers are purchasing stocks on investors behalf that they believe are undervalued based on cash flow growth potential and many other factors so this means that your money's invested in medium to large sized companies that are well established and often time tested currently the top five holdings of this fund include number one berkshire hathaway at four point three eight percent number two comcast at three point five eight percent number three united health at two point seven three percent number four google at 2.65 and number five the healthcare company bms at 2.64 so as you can see there you have a lot of defensive you also have utilities there representative with comcast telecom you have healthcare you have google which is really sort of this basically utility at this point in a weird way providing different necessary online services so this is not going to be a growth fund this is a value fund where you're looking to invest in companies when they are near their underlying value and a good buy based on their cash flows not so much investing in what's going to be the most growing company or innovative company now again since this is actively managed it's going to have a higher cost identical to the last one at 0.59 percent or 590 dollars per year as the cost on a hundred thousand dollars invested now this etf does come in with the highest dividend yield on our list at 3.62 percent making this a fantastic compound interest investment now on that topic of income and dividends coming in at number five on the list is another income focused etf that is schd the schwab us dividend equity etf now what you like about this fund in particular is that similar to vanguard charles schwab is known for having extremely low costs on their funds this particular fund comes in with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06 percent"", ""AS of the end of December eyd offered a lower valuation level than its Morningstar category again in every single metric for price to earnings ratio the multiple was 5.84 whereas the category was more than double at 12.2 for

now shifting gears a bit for any listeners who are curious about the construction of this type of Fund in short we begin with a broad Universe of stocks of a suitable market capitalization that also passed liquidity and price requirements next we select the stocks in the top 20 percent of that Universe by yields across dividends net BuyBacks we apply some valuation Ensemble across a number of factors some of the ones we discussed previously we referenced five of them earlier in this podcast for example we further shrink the universe by isolating the top shareholder yield stocks registering higher debt retirement with low financial leverage those are both quality metrics we also seek to avoid value traps by doing a final sort based on momentum indicators it can be an exhausting process but we believe it's worth it as results speak for themselves as we wrap up yes this is a challenging Market but you don't have to sacrifice income or growth or reasonable valuation you just have to

to second the total stock market index fund vt sacs now unlike our previous example that only includes the S&P500 vt sacs is designed to give you exposure to the entire us equities market including small mid-size and large cap stocks where for one low price you could own a small piece of 4 100 different stocks it also returned an average of 8.2 annually since it was started over 20 years ago meaning over the last decade a 10 000 investment would now be worth 34 000 the advantage of a total stock market index fund like this is that it's so comprehensive and so diversified throughout the us that this could literally be the only investment that you make from here on out if you believe the united states will continue to do well now of course if you're thinking but graham how does this fund make more money than the S&P500 because i see this one makes 8.2 and the other one makes 7.8 percent what's up with that and these are great questions that i ask myself because you get so much diversification throughout the entire market this fund contains smaller stocks which have a higher likelihood of seeing stronger returns and when you place those in your portfolio it begins to explain the slightly higher profit as proof of this between 1980 and 2015 smaller stocks returned 11.2 percent annual growth on average while large stocks returned to 8 that's why it might be a good idea to expand your portfolio and diversify your investments a little bit more of course just like our last example there is a 3 000 minimum deposit with vt sax and there is a 0.04 annual management fee although you can opt for the etf version vti and that gets you all the diversification you would need without that pesky minimum investment although the bad news here is that this only encapsulates the united states and as we know the world is a very big place so as a way to bridge that gap we have number three the vanguard international index fund vtyx this is an index fund that covers the stock market outside of the united states including emerging markets europe the pacific the middle east and north america some of their largest holdings are the companies that we use on a day-to-day basis like semiconductors video games alibaba samsung nestle toyota and so on the advantage here is that as other countries grow and develop their stock prices increase and therefore your money grows even further but here's the thing over the last 10 years international stocks have remained fairly flat and throughout the last two decades the united states has been on a roll outperforming just about every other market out there although that is not guaranteed to continue happening throughout history there have been multiple times where international stocks have outperformed the united states like throughout most of the 1980s and 2000s and there's certainly a chance that that could happen again so in this case something like vitaex has returned about five percent annually since its inception in november of 2000 and it'll pay you a dividend to roughly 3.37 annually that means for every 10 000 you invest you will get 337 a year in sweet sweet passive income although just like the other examples with vanguard they do have the usual three thousand dollar minimum and because international stocks take a little bit more to facilitate they do charge a higher expense ratio of point one one percent""]"

at the moment now for valuation analysts are looking for adjusted EPS of 2.41 in 2023 which equates to a 2023 earnings multiple of 6 0.5 times that is incredibly low for comparable purposes over the

earnings result the company has a market cap of 18 billion dollars and over the past 12 months the stock is down over 40 percent year-to-date Tyson Foods Shares are down 18 that is a nasty chart to look at to say the least concerns around the company have been due to Rising costs which have eaten into profit margins no pun intended but the inflationary environment that we're in is definitely taking a toll on Tyson Foods part of the reason for the decline is due in part to the last two years being some of the best years for the company looking at this chart you can see the company's share price rise from the summer of 2020 to new highs in the winter and spring of 2022"", ""but they also have a very strong pipeline coming down the line the medical device segment also known as Medtech is

percent and year to date it is down 13 percent in fact Shares are trading very close to their 52-week low giving investors a great opportunity to add to this Healthcare conglomerate we are talking

the company currently yields a dividend of 3.1 percent and they have a five-year dividend growth rate of 5.7 percent with the stock trading near the 52-week low let's take a look at where that puts

toes into this great stock for those of you that are unaware the Dow Jones Industrial Average is actually a price weighted index unlike the S&P500 which is weighted based on market caps"", ""see I'm like buying a stock and only being taxed when you sell Dividends are taxed the moment you receive them and depending on your tax bracket that could be a price of 20 or more not to mention in a way Dividends are even taxed twice once the corporate level is profit and then once again when you receive them so they're not exactly the most tax efficient and fourth dividends could flat out be Irrelevant in this case two well-known economists argued that if an investor needs the money all they really need to do is sell the stock and that dividends don't actually create any more value for the company itself it would be kind of like saying instead of getting paid a two percent dividend the stock price would just go up by an extra two percent whereas in both scenarios your value stays the exact same although in the big picture I do think that there are some major advantages for anyone looking to replace their income with this strategy so as far as how to do this as well as my own portfolio here's what you need to know although before we go into that when it comes to investing it's important to have as much information at your disposal as possible even for myself I'll spend hours combing through the most obscure reports just to find a few new details to take into consideration that's why it's crucial that you use a platform that gives you access to all the tools and information that you need to make informed investment decisions like our sponsorepublic.com for those unaware public is the only investment platform that allows you to buy hold or sell a wide variety of options all in one place from stocks ETFs fractionalized alternative Investments Fine Art Collectibles and even treasuries which gives you the opportunity to earn a fixed return at competitive rates this means the public could be a One-Stop shop to build a well-diversified portfolio within a platform that doesn't sell your trades to market makers like some of the other investment apps do

Amazon's latest Revenue breakdown by segment they also have great customer support so if you ever have any questions comments or need assistance you're able to connect with real people quickly and

a free stock Slice worth all the way up to three hundred dollars when you use the link in the description or go to public.com feel free to check out all of the details down below and now with that said let's get back to the video all right now in terms of my own dividend portion of my own portfolio I currently receive almost ten thousand dollars a month through five main sources the first and largest is from a broad U.S Market ETF schb with the dividend yield of 1.56 percent this encompasses 2500 of the largest publicly traded us companies with slightly more exposure to smaller stocks than the S&P500 although not by much since both are weighted by market cap which means that the largest companies still make up the bulk of this investment but when you have over 3.8 million dollars invested here that's a dividend yield of about five thousand dollars a month second in addition to that I also have an international Equity ETF schf with a dividend yield of 2.65 percent for those of aware this fund includes large and mid-cap stocks from developed countries outside of the United States including Nestle's Samsung shell and Toyota along with about a hundred others I personally use this as a way to get diversification outside of the United States and since I have almost a million dollars invested here that brings in an additional two thousand dollars a month third in addition to that I also have a variety of individual stocks that I hold on the side to satisfy my need to feel like I could somehow beat the market that brings my total to about ninety four hundred dollars in dividends every single month or about a hundred and twelve thousand dollars a year regardless of what happens to the stock market but as far as how much you need to live entirely off the dividends here's the entire calculation to begin it all comes down to how much do you need after all the person living in a luxury high-rise Penthouse in New York City is going to live a much different lifestyle than someone who prefers to live off the grid in a tiny home in Montana so it would depend on what your expenses are but since the average retiree spends 50 thousand dollars a year we'll go with that as our Baseline the second when it comes to dividends you don't necessarily want to go for the stock that just pays the highest yield after all you want consistency and that's what brings us to the Holy Grail of passive income dividend Aristocrats""]"

names i don't see any of this stuff about ethereum anymore for some reason i think that's odd don't you because the reality is so vastly different than the claims being made by so many that just simply have no clue such throughput is unreachable for current blockchain networks the normal throughput of a proof of work network is usually only a few dozen transactions per second proof of stake networks can reach several hundred transactions per second distributed networks generally suffer from serious scalability limitations low throughput and excessive storage required to maintain the state of the system and its transaction history after some five years of interdisciplinary research efforts in iohk the hydra paper was released scientists and researchers from networking multi-party computation programming language and consensus branches had to work together to come up with a scaling solution that fits well with blockchain and smart contracts it is a major scientific achievement and a significant milestone in the development of cardano oroboros hydra breaks new ground and proof of stake scalability with hydra cardano can really become the alternative to current fiat money hydra is the second layer solution on top of the cardano first layer where pos consensus is used hydra is designed in a way that fits well with a stake pull model the io hk team introduced an extended utxo model that allows sharding of stake space without the need to shard the ledger itself this is significant as crypto kirby would say for you degenerates out there that fail to read or understand what some of the means it means changing the entire paradigm of crypto forever on cardano it is still possible to shard on the ledger level and hydra is a complementary part of the whole scaling solution wait till we get to the meat of this every pool can create a new hydra's head so adding more pools means that more heads can be added so by adding new heads to the protocol nearly the issues they protocols nearly linear scaling can be achieved simulations have been done and the results are great each hydra head can process around a thousand transactions per second and there is room for further optimization so with one thousand pools which we have more than that i think we have like 1600 cardano could be theoretically able to scale up to 1 million transactions per second per second compared to 150 million transactions every day we're talking about a million per second on cardano"", ""and maybe I will for right now this is just a face value observation of a project that I think it has caught my attention we'll just say that now the Casper Association update on circulating Supply and it talks about some different issues with that but on March 31st 2021 the Genesis block of Casper validators launched the Casper mainnet over the past 18 months we have seen tremendous growth of the network including as of today 85 000 plus Casper accounts 18 400 plus delegators 200 plus connected node so basically like Crow node on cardano there have been there are about 200 nodes I may look into launching one of these myself 540 000 plus native token transfers currently approximately 74 of all cash for tokens are staked and bonded to the network providing notable security Casper's telegram channels including the Casper main Channel and various Geographic language channels include more than a hundred thousand members which telegram members doesn't really mean that much to me I could launch a group and throw a hundred thousand members in it with all the services I get spammed with every day but I haven't also I haven't joined it to see how active it actually is there are more than 188 000 followers across the Twitter channels of Casper labs and Casper Network and there are over 31 500 members in Casper's Discord Channel what's more native Native web 3 projects and Innovative Enterprise businesses of all sizes are adopting Casper is their layer one chain of choice at an ever increasing Pace now some of the Articles and things that I'm about to show you will probably solidify this a bit um the first thing I want to talk about Casper Labs joins AWS Marketplace to expand developer access to its Enterprise blockchain now we're not going to dive into all these articles but the headlines speak for themselves to some degree Casper on Google Cloud a secure and flexible web 3 option for developers this is a pretty big deal Casper is the first and only blockchain to offer native upgradable smart contracts this means that organizations can have the option to securely and consistently update software code even after it's running on Casper I've never seen that before so this is legit that's pretty significant why do I think this is extra significant when I dive into some of the other Partnerships and some of the other efforts of this project it really kind of clicks and makes me kind of wonder what they're all all overall agenda might be Casper Labs joins the hyper Ledger Foundation to accelerate Enterprise adoption of blockchain this was on September 12th of 2022 this is all fairly recent and the price is sitting at about five cents and if a lot of these relationships and I've got a big one coming they have a lot of this stuff really starts to to come to fruition and start formulating some significant business relationships it could mean significant growth in this next Bull cycle Casper Labs joins the world economic Forum Global innovators Community as a blockchain and digital assets partner this one we're going to dive into a little bit now the enterprise blockchain software leader announced today it has joined the world economic forums innovators Community the foremost Global Network for leading startups"", ""hello everybody welcome back for another video hope you're all doing well and having a great day this is another special video if you will this one is pretty much about if you can become a millionaire by investing in Cardno or a da the circulating supply of a da is currently twenty five point nine billion coins and the max supply will be forty five billion a da the current market cap is five point two billion US dollars and this entire video is based on a forecast that sometime in the future the crypto market could potentially one day be worth thirty to fifty trillion dollars I must also note I am NOT a professional financial advisor I am just a normal person talking into a microphone sitting in a room in my house please make sure to do your own research as much as possible on what you put your money into please do not throw money into cardano's simply because I made this video and moving forward let's start talking about some of the things that Cardinal has done thus far I'm not going to go too deep into everything that they have done it's more of a backdrop Cardno itself is not that old if you will it's only a couple of months olds not even a year old since the project has officially been launched but since then they have made a partnership with Seiran labs they have developed a partnership with Emmert ago which is a Japanese blockchain startup who has announced the integration of cardano's ad a coin into men apps plus the partnership with the Met apps plus a South Korean payment platform would involve integrating cordana into the metopes plus platform which is responsible for 10 million mobile offline transactions which is huge for a coin that has not been around for even a year yet in addition to this card ah no plans to spread ATMs all over Japan in 2018 there are a lot of other coins that have tried to do this and they have failed at the moment you can probably easily find a Bitcoin ATM depending on where you live but you would probably be hard-pressed to find an aetherium ATM ripple ATM or any other coin especially litecoin ATM so this is kind of if they do manage to pull this off this will have a huge impact on the price because Japan is a huge leader in the cryptocurrency world along with this they plan on launching a debit card something else that many other crypto projects have not been able to do at all many have tried many have failed simply because when people try to partner up with the bank the banks usually end up saying no because they do not want their names sullied by the use of cryptocurrencies or any type of integration with them so if Cardno manages to pull off a debit card in theory this should have a great effect on the price of the coin in addition to all of this Charles huskin team leader developer at Cardinal foundation also a co-founder of i/o HK on Twitter announced previously the signing of a Memorandum between Cardno and the Ethiopian Ministry of Science and Technology in a bid to promote the presence of blockchain technology in the country which means in essence they have partnered with Ethiopia to try and get a blockchain further along in not less developed countries but in countries that aren't as prominent when you talk about cryptocurrency spaces so this is also very significant when it comes to the price a lot of the crypto 3.0 coins one of the main things about them is that they claim that they will be able to be quick enough to handle worldly transactions on a daily basis at the moment in his peers that Cardno is able to handle 257 transactions per second which is not bad""]"

so firstly i just want to read a quick extract from uh buffett's 1981 annual report annual letter and this is under a section that is called berkshire acquisition objectives if you want to kind of go and find the letter i'll leave it linked down in the description below highly recommend reading through as many of these as you can so um basically the sort of preamble before the section i'm about to read buffett is sort of talking about how he'd struggled to find he'd struggled during that particular year to find a lot of private businesses to buy so berkshire hathaway buys both private businesses and public companies uh depending on basically the opportunity set they will tend to move into more heavily into one or the other just depending on kind of the opportunities available if private business investments look more attractive that's where they'll go if public business investments look more attractive that's where they'll go you know just depending on what's available at the time so with that in mind this is what buffett had to say so currently we find values most easily obtained through the open market purchase of fractional positions in companies with excellent business franchises and competent honest managements we never expect to run these companies but we do expect to profit from them we expect that undistributed earnings from such companies will produce full value subject to tax when realized for berkshire and its shareholders if they don't we've made mistakes as to either one the management we have elected to join two the future economics of the business or three the price we have paid we've made plenty of such mistakes both in the purchase of non-controlling and controlling interests and businesses category two miscalculations are the most common and that's referring back to sort of the future economics of the business of course it is necessary to dig deep into our history to find illustrations of such mistakes sometimes as deep as two or three months back for example last year your chairman volunteered his expert opinion on the rosy future of the aluminium business several minor adjustments to that opinion now aggregating approximately 180 degrees have since been required there you have it even the great warren buffett makes mistakes and he makes mistakes very very frequently and they generally fall into one of these three categories so either they partnered with the wrong management they were wrong on the future economics of the business or they simply paid too high a price so i want to walk through in more detail what each of those three things kind of refer to and try to give you some examples along the way um so sit back relax hit like on the video if you do enjoy and let's get straight into that so let's talk about the first mistake that warren buffett lists here with partnering with the wrong management now unfortunately for us as investors there are a whole range of things that managers of businesses ceos cfos boards of directors all sorts of people uh there's a crazy wide range of things that they can do that can really spoil an investment uh for individual stockholders who don't really have much say in kind of controlling and sort of running the business and although there are a wide range of things that can happen there's generally a couple of key kind of ideas that push management teams into making mistakes or doing things that aren't in the interest of shareholders and the first big one that i really like to look at strongly is simply the incentives of management now ideally what you really want as an investor someone at the helm of that company with the exact same incentives as you now the incentive for you as a shareholder is for the share price to go up is for dividend payments and share buybacks and things over time to to go up and for you to get a good long-term return from simply holding shares in that business that is your incentive now the incentive for the management team may be different uh in some cases it's similar um for example if we have someone as a ceo of a business who started that company and they have a very large shareholding in that business or if they have acquired a very large share holding in that business over time you know maybe someone like warren buffett at berkshire hathaway owns about a third of all the shares but didn't actually start the business or perhaps you have someone like mark zuckerberg at facebook who did start the business and has a substantial shareholding in the company if you're in uh and teamed up with one of those types of people you're going to be in a position where the incentives of both you as the shareholder and them as the management team are pretty much exactly aligned now one of the things you can run into every now and then is you have misaligned incentives so you have you as the shareholder hoping that the stock goes up over time and maybe you have a ceo that is incentivized on maybe one or two kind of key metrics within the business that don't always correlate with uh good returns over time now a really good example of this would be something like a management team being incentivized based on revenue growth now revenue growth is fantastic that's something that you ideally need over time in order to grow the earnings of the business generally as well um but there are some dodgy things that you can do to grow revenue without really growing the sort of economic prospects of the underlying business now for example you can go out uh you can borrow a bunch of money and you can acquire another business"", ""hey guys in this video we are going over three stocks that Warren Buffett either already owns or would be proud to own I'll dive into the fundamentals and analysis of each of these companies and show you why they actually matched Warren Buffett's investing style make sure to watch all the way through to get an idea of why these stock picks could be very strong and also why they could be reliable growth socks that you can actually add into your own portfolio so we all know Warren Buffett the king of investors and probably one of the most influential people to ever live in the stock and investing world at 89 years old and with a net worth of about seventy billion dollars some would say that if there were a god of investing it would actually be him he's the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway which along with the terribly simple website fully owns companies such as Geico Fruit of the Loom Duracell and Dairy Queen and also owns a large percentage of companies like Kraft Heinz American Express Wells Fargo Apple and Bank of America he's known as a value investor preferring to invest long-term in companies with strong financials he's especially well known for actually investing in companies that are currently trading below their intrinsic value and holding them and building them until they actually reached their real value you're never gonna see Warren Buffett investing in companies like Tesla where speculation and potential future growth seem to outweigh all the shortcomings on their balance sheets and nothing used to be a large shareholders of the four largest US airlines he actually revealed as Lee's shareholders meaning that he had sold his entire position of US airline stocks he said that basically they just rarely sell portions of a company and if they do want to get out of an industry or a company they'll likely just sell all their shares and sell he did though he did end up losing a significant amount of money with the sale these airline financials just do not look promising to Warren Buffett and he thinks that even the current values of the stocks are not justified based on the numbers so here are some things that he actually swears by one is finding quality companies with a competitive advantage Warren Buffett hates buying companies that are not strong and he absolutely will not buy companies that do not have a competitive advantage which he actually calls a moat second is he says that you should invest like you're actually buying up the entire company now of course most of us in socks we can't afford to buy up a whole company so we're just purchasing individual shares however he says you should treat this like you are actually buying the company is it a good buy are you buying a discount or are you overpaying for the company so to do that you must also look at the book and intrinsic valuations third is you must invest in what you understand I think this is very important for a lot of investors because a lot of people just buy a stock based on its name without really knowing what the company does its current balance sheet and financials or the industry as a whole this really magnifies the importance of due diligence and that is doing your own research and coming up with your own conclusions and this fourth rule is keep cash on hand always have a good amount of cash available on hand in case investment opportunities do come yes some aggressive investors will actually not hold onto too much cash because they do want to leverage their money if you're holding onto cash that means the money is not currently invested and growing but of course there is a trade-off between risk and safety holding cash can definitely be a safer way to invest especially if you're keeping up to date with the markets and know what to invest in so let's go over three stocks that fit his criteria and I'll give you my opinions on each one as well as why you might want to add it to your own portfolio so number one is Apple AAPL Warren Buffett currently owns about 5.7 percent of Apple which equates to about seventy five billion dollars worth of shares this is his biggest holding in a company that he truly loves so currently Apple is trading at $299 and 42 cents with a 52-week low of $170 and 27 cents and a high of 327 dollars and 85 cents they currently have the market cap of one point two nine eight trillion dollars and a beta of one point one seven"", ""and he said that he often goes to Warren Buffett's house on a Sunday afternoon and they kind of just talk business and invest in and Buffett has said to him how many names in the s p are going to be at 15 times earnings in the next 12 months how many of those are going to earn more in five years than they are today with a 90 confidence interval and how many will compound at seven percent a year using a 50 confidence interval Combs kind of described that by going through this exercise you're solving for a range of things and eliminating a lot of businesses very quickly he said you're solving for cyclicality compounding and initial price and Todd Combs actually explained that this is one of the reasons that they found Apple a few years ago they were going through this process in the same three to five companies kind of just kept coming up over and over again and apple was one of those businesses to me this is really interesting because I've heard Buffett talk for years at this point about kind of the concepts behind valuation you know it's the whole a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush and how sure are you that kind of idea that uh Buffett has talked about for a long period of time but I've never seen sort of quantitative metrics put behind it and uh to see this idea of you know 15 times earnings and are they going to earn more in five years with a very high degree of confidence and slightly lower kind of confidence intervals around how long they can compound at a certain rate to have some quantitative data behind how Buffett thinks about that to kind of weed out a lot of stocks that he isn't necessarily interested in that for me is a pretty huge Insight next hot Combs talked quite a bit about company management and how it goes about assessing management teams and so on and some of the ways that he and Buffett think about company management and capital allocation he said businesses are run by people Buffett likes removing the cash from managers and investing it himself my interpretation of that is that's probably one of the reasons that Buffett is such a fan of sheer BuyBacks as opposed to CEOs going out and doing big Acquisitions and so on he also said that you know as we've heard many times before he's looking for a business that a dummy can run because eventually a dummy will run it and there's a very old school Charlie Munger idea about focusing on CEO incentives and that that can tell you a huge amount and there's a couple of things that Todd Combs had to say on that is Todd Combs said if he was 150 dedicated just to analyzing companies he'd focus on Delta reports and see what management is changing from year to year he said in 2005 beer Stearns which obviously ended up going bankrupt in the in the global financial crisis he said beer Stearns changed something very essential in their reports while saying something different to the street or saying something different to investors and analysts article goes on to say that a big signaling effect for Combs is when management changes the key performance indicators for which they are compensated by that's kind of a major red flag for Todd Combs and combs estimated that in the Fortune 500 approximately 20 percent of companies are changing incentive metrics for management and that that's not an accident again to get a really good feel for how management are thinking about running the business and their underlying incentives uh Todd Combs said that if he ever talks with company management he basically asks them two questions firstly he says how long do you spend talking to investors and secondly he says what would you be doing if you were not publicly traded if you were a privately owned business for example um he said the median response is about 25 percent of time is spent talking to investors and in response to the second question about what would they be doing differently if they were a private company um he said that generally management teams list off a few things that make a whole lot of sense and then Combs proceeds to ask them why they don't do that and they say because they feel handcuffed um you know they're forced often times to focus on quarterly performance they don't think they have the proper time Horizons they're not empowered to do the right thing and that's a really good example of again things that you would not like to see Berkshire hathway for example does not care about a quarterly performance at all they care about long-term performance they spend zero time talking to analysts they have you know letters and annual reports and stuff that come out and they have the annual meeting but they don't um you know spend day-to-day time kind of talking to analysts and that's a common theme I've actually seen through a few companies now over time that have successful track records toddcombe spent quite a bit of time talking about how he thinks about valuation and owner earnings for companies so he says that you should focus on basically two things you should focus on unit economics and the underlying business and you should focus on owner earnings as opposed to reported you know generally accepted accounting principles earnings he gave the example of birch Hathaway which you know each quarter has to Mark to Market their stock portfolio that flows through the income statement so in a quarter where the stock market simply goes up a lot berkshire's earnings can look really good and that is obviously not um kind of a true reflection of the underlying operating businesses so you really have to focus on the underlying earnings for a kind of true owner of that business how much cash could be extracted from the business after you know maintenance Capital expenditures and so on so that's one thing he pays a lot of attention to and the other thing like I said was unit economics and that can change quite a bit from business to business so he said for example you can have a software as a service business incurring 100 cents on the dollar and expenses on day one and uh going forward earn whatever the lifetime value of the customers so you have to have a view where you can understand what the financial image looks like for example in the early days of Walmart on Amazon I wouldn't focus on the fact that the reserves seem wrong and quite large look at where where it took them I build out unit growth economics and the case of Walmart look at each individual store and that's your North Star you backtrack""]"

I really like about palantir besides that double-digit growth management is focused on becoming more profitable at the same time increasing the operating margin to 24 percent in the quarter a full year revenue for the company is expected to come in 16 higher at 2.2 billion which means after that 59 run in the shares this year it's trading at 46 times expected earnings of 22 cents a share even more expensive than Microsoft now I do think palantir has the more focused growth in AI but the stock price is baking in a lot of that growth and we've still got that last AI stock you need to be

20 years in total Google captures 92 percent of all internet searches and over the course of that 20 years they have indexed more than one billion web pages Google has become such a powerful brand that the name itself became a verb that's synonymous with search for example I Googled it Google wins because Google is fast and relevant they deliver millions of results in a fraction of a second this is due to billions of dollars spent investing in infrastructure this gives Google what appears to be a defensive moat in the search engine business a moat is a trench All Around Your Castle the concept in business of the moat has been made Popular by Warren Buffett he describes it as a Competitive Edge that is not easily overcome historically castles have a large ditch they filled with fortifications crocodiles piranhas these are their defenses and the bigger the advantage or the cost to compete with a business the more Protected Their Market or their brand is thus creating a larger moat so who is competing with Google well back in the day they Rose to Power by crushing Yahoo and a company called Alta Vista let me know in the comments if you ever used Alta Vista today they fight off being Baidu from China Yahoo still Yandex from Russia the company ask and Duck Duck Go as well as many many others who are trying to crack into the search business how does Google though stack up to these other companies let's take a quick look at their fundamentals Google's market cap is 1.13 trillion making them the fourth largest company in the world these guys made 257 billion dollars in 2021 and their current and p e ratio is just 17.68 compared to a 22.89 average for the rest of the S&P500 companies these guys have the strongest balance sheet in Corporate America super high profit

we even comparing a two percent market share being with Google well because even though Google is a giant today perhaps they have more to lose than gain and with the rise of AI Microsoft they may be

very important details firstly in order to use this feature you need to provide ID of some sort so you already need to trust that this information won't get out or be shared with someone else but what really caused alarm bells to start ringing was the idea that a seed phrase could in fact be extracted from the device in the first place that runs contrary to everything that people have thought about Hardware wallets that the private key would remain on the device and could never be exposed or extracted in any way the Uproar was Swift and merciless polygon lab's Chief information security officer said on Twitter quote the problem here is that the encrypted key parts are sent to three corporations and they can reconstruct your keys popular crypto Twitter personality DC investor said quote WTF are you guys doing this is going in the wrong direction fast I would recommend no one upgrade to such firmware many others were a lot less generous with their choice of words and on the first day of the recover Services release Ledger was in pure PR firefighting mode they decided to hold a Twitter spaces on release day and were pains to point out that this was only opt-in and people didn't have to use it if they didn't want to moreover users could decline to install the firmware update which carried this new feature however this all raised more questions than it answered for one would Ledger be providing a separate firmware upgrade that did not include this feature they couldn't just expect users not to upgrade in perpetuity eventually their ledgers would go out of date and wouldn't support certain apps but perhaps the far more pressing question that came from this was whether Ledger had the ability to issue a firmware upgrade that could extract a private key essentially are our private Keys one poisoned firmware update away from being exfiltrated how much trust should we place in Ledger's handling of their firmware upgrades for one thing it's not as though Ledger has the best record when it comes to storing customer data the hack of its database and subsequent leak of customer records in 2020 is not easily forgotten and even if we do fully trust Ledger what happens if the company is subpoenaed what if a government agency forces them to issue a firmware upgrade that builds in the backdoor functionality now the backlash only got worse for Ledger the following day statements from the company on Twitter only seem to make an already dire PR situation worse that's because previous statements had been made that stated that the private key never left the secure element chip in a tweet from November of last year Ledger had said quote a firmware upgrade cannot extract the private keys from the secure element yikes all of this raises some important questions not only about Ledger devices but about Hardware wallets more broadly so let's start with perhaps the biggest misconception that we all had that no key data is ever able to leave the device now here I'm going to lean on this tweet thread by haseeb Qureshi the managing partner at dragonfly capital"", ""A crypto investment fund he presented these two infographics for us this one is how we used to think Hardware wallets like ledgers worked this one is how they actually work now the secure element chip is like a small computer that also holds Ledger's operating system this means that Ledger's firmware upgrades can affect the way things function inside the secure element so it can be programmed to send back anything that's requested now this is actually required in order for the device to upgrade and support newer chains whenever there's a new app being installed on the device it will in principle be able to extract private key data that's because in order to support these new chains they'll need to create a new key that's derived from the master key on the device now I'll also leave a link to the thread by Ledger's CTO in the description for you as it goes into the mechanics in much more detail as he makes clear in that thread using a hardware Wallet requires a quote minimal amount of trust this means that every time you've had to approve an upgrade on a ledger device you've had to have trust and as we all know trust is a dirty word in crypto it goes against the ethos on which trustless blockchains are built moreover as I mentioned earlier it's not about trust in Ledger per se but trusting that they won't have to comply with any sort of government requests now Ledger's co-founder and ex-ceo created a Reddit post where he addressed the debacle and said that technically governments could recover the shards and quote get access to your funds I will caveat though that this was in the context of the recover shards and not the issuance of poisoned updates but surely the principle should be the same in a recent podcast the current CEO also waved that subpoena concern Away by saying that it's quote not that common however he was reminded that coinbase was recently subpoenaed for something as simple as customer data I'll leave a link to that podcast in the description for you folks now one of the reasons for this miscommunication and subsequent PR disaster is that Ledger's code is closed Source users were never able to peer into the repositories and see how the secure element worked hence the reason that this all came as a shock so the result is that many are now calling for the code to be open sourced indeed I think that this is one of the only ways in which users can fully verify the security of the device as they say don't trust verify and this is also one of the reasons as to why I have always preferred Treasures over ledgers tresor's code is open source and hence there's no room for confusion as to how the devices operate moreover they have the option to generate more than one seed phrase through their Shamir backup now I've talked about this in much more detail in my Tresor video but it basically allows contingencies for seed loss without having to hand over seed phrases to the manufacturer or third-party custodians that said open source is no Silver Bullet by opening your code to the world you're also opening it up to all those who may want to exploit it moreover most treasure users don't read the code that's being pushed before choosing to upgrade I can't read firmware code myself and I am going to have to hope that the white hat hackers out there are better at auditing it than the black hats are so there is still an element of trust needed in third parties I'll also add that Tresor devices are vulnerable to what are termed high voltage glitching attacks now I won't go into the specifics of those here but I will link to a handy video by Kraken security Labs that discovered the exploit the caveat here though is that such an attack requires physical access to the device as well as the tools and Technical know-how to execute it and if you're looking for any other wallet Alternatives then you could consider a

up this is the stocks with Josh show as always thank you so much for hitting the like join the family by hitting that subscribe and that YouTube all notification Bell watch out for the scammers if you need better trade tools there's an offer from the MooMoo Investment app you're currently giving away up to 20 free stocks for opening and funding an account you can click on the link in the top pin comment for all the details I host a chat group on the app called stock Josh fam if you're on MooMoo then come over and find us get your free stock if you're not and then come find the chat group we'll continue the conversation there all right we got that inflation data this morning and it was actually pretty good it largely came in line with expectations many though were expecting it to climb and prove that inflation was going to remain a very sticky issue or a persisting threat to the market the Consumer Price Index CPI Rose 0.4 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in March the increase was in line with what economists were expecting stubbornly High rents accounted for much of the increase in the inflation that we saw in my view the inflation data seems to suggest that the FED could afford to pause raising rates but it would stop short of suggesting that he could actually cut rates inflation is going to continue to be problematic but at the moment it doesn't seem to be as bad as feared yet despite this good news the market remained confused yet again it was big Tech that pushed up while the rest of the market was either gray which means that the price was flat or red which means obvious decline Google was one of the biggest big Tech movers of the day with a four percent pop-up now you guys know that I sold all my Google Shares I sold them at 109 bucks I accumulated those shares below 92 bucks which I told you months in advance it would hit it did I was able to cash out with a huge increase I also told you guys that if the price got back above 108 to 109 that I could just jump back in I did not buy the shares but after it moved back above 108 I jumped into some call options this is is a confirmed breakout on Google and the stock could actually move up at this point to 117 dollars that's my target not my prediction my get out price is going to be any close back below 109 that's the risk line that I've drawn in the sand for my investment I'm bullish above 109 I'm bearish below so what moved the stock price higher well today at Google's annual development conference these guys announced a one thousand eight hundred dollar phone with built-in AI you guys I tell you these phones are getting more and more expensive I am sure that we're going to break over that two thousand dollar phone price barrier they're getting them more expensive than laptops more expensive than any other technology in our lives so the stock popped because the market loved it because the market loves any talk of AI in a recent video I talked about how big AI is I even called it a recession killer AI in my view is drawing a line in the sand for winners and losers for all of 2023.""]"

are some disclaimers that need unpacking if you're looking for financial advice i'm afraid you won't get any from me that's because i'm not a financial advisor i do educational crypto content for free if this is your first time seeing my face my name is guy and welcome to my place this channel is packed with enough quality crypto content to give you a heart attack coins tokens defy and nfts there's no crypto topic that's too big or small for me if this is what you've been looking for subscribe to the channel and ping that notification bell to ensure you get more you can use the timestamps in the video timeline to get around and skip ahead to any juicy topics you've found i'd love it if you watched from start to finish because the youtube algorithm gives lots of weight to your minutes that's enough of that let's get on with stacks staxx was founded in 2013 by computer scientists munib ali and ryan shea at the university of princeton stax is the product of munib's doctoral thesis which detailed a framework for an internet that could be built around the bitcoin blockchain this framework is called block stack and this was also the original name of the project until it rebranded to stacks in october last year the new york software company that developed stacks also rebranded from block stack pbc to hiro systems pbc and i'll explain why that's significant later on at the conceptual level you can think of stacks as being a layer 2 blockchain for bitcoin like the lightning network the stax blockchain also uses a novel consensus mechanism called proof of transfer that leverages bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus for security proof of transfer is conceptually similar to proof-of-stake as it involves stackers who stack the stx token on the stacks blockchain and earn bitcoin as a reward this bitcoin comes from stax miners who commit btc to the stax blockchain for a chance to mine a block on the stax blockchain and earn stx the btc they commit goes to stackers as stacking rewards the reasoning behind this consensus mechanism is that each btc coin essentially represents mining power from bitcoin's proof-of-work blockchain everything that happens on the stacks blockchain is verifiable on the bitcoin blockchain this doesn't modify or strain the bitcoin network because this information is just regular btc transactions made by stax miners in addition the stax blockchain is smart contract compatible and uses a specialized coding language called clarity that was created with the help of algorand instead of storing the data from its smart contracts on chain smart contract data generated by the stacks blockchain is stored off-chain in a decentralized storage system called gaia all data generated by a user on the stacks blockchain is assigned to their unique identity i.e their wallet address only the holder of the wallet address can access its associated data stored on gaia and give permissions to decentralized applications and third parties to do the same now this only scratches the surface of how stax works and if you want to take a closer look under the hood you can do just that by watching my first video about stacks and the link for that is as ever in the top right although the stax blockchain has technically been live since late 2019 it wasn't until mid-january this year that stacks became a finished product this was marked by the release of stax 2.0 which enabled proof of transfer mining and smart contract functionality on the stacks blockchain it turns out that how proof of transfer works in practice is pretty damn complicated but it seems to be lucrative for both miners and stackers to briefly recap the stx token has halving cycles similar to bitcoins for the first four years the block reward on the stacks blockchain is 1000 stx per block with the current market price of stx this works out to just over two thousand dollars per block plus any transaction fees in that block from the stacks blockchain now if my calculations are correct the amount of btc you'd need to commit to the stacks blockchain to minor block is currently about fifteen hundred dollars that's about a five hundred dollar profit in stx which is not too shabby that said the amount of btc that needs to be committed changes over time since the likelihood of getting chosen to minor block is proportional to how much btc you have committed relative to other minors moreover there is a risk that the btc you commit as a minor could appreciate during the 16 hour time frame it takes to receive your rewards in stx the value of the stx you're waiting for could also fall during that time now on the bright side the hardware requirements to mine stx are extremely low and if you're interested in mining on stacks i'll leave a few resources for you in the video description if you're more of a stacker the amount of stx you have to stack to earn the btc being committed by miners is likewise based on how much stx other stackers are stacking right now the minimum amount of stx you need to stack is 90 000."", ""[Music] before we get that bread i need to make sure you are not misled i am not a financial advisor and nothing in this video should be misconstrued as financial or investment advice though i also cannot guarantee that watching this video will land you a job in crypto i reckon it will help grease that groove remember it will be on you to take what you learn here and put it into action my name is guy and if this is your first time here it is a pleasure to meet you here at the coin bureau i do much more than give people guides on how to get involved with a great growth industry it's my mission to bring you the highest quality information about everything cryptocurrency coins tokens d5 protocols exchanges nfts and market analyses are just a few of the topics i discuss on the daily if this is the sort of content you need in your day then do us both a favor and hit up that subscribe button remember to ping that notification bell too since the youtube overlords are not always keen on promoting crypto content if you take a peek at the timeline below you'll see i've added a few timestamps feel free to use those to jump around if you're feeling feisty also if you're serious about working in the cryptocurrency space i recommend grabbing a pen and paper or opening up a digital note on your phone or computer to jot down a few bullet points if you'd rather just sit back and listen to my mellifluous tones then you can just copy and paste the bullet points i provided in the video description you're welcome now let's go job hunting the first step to getting a job in cryptocurrency is to ask yourself is this really the career path you want to take to be blunt working in the cryptocurrency space is not for everyone if you feel that you're on the fence in this regard allow me to detail what i believe to be the primary advantages and disadvantages to working in crypto for starters the cryptocurrency industry is extremely resilient to things like global pandemics this is because almost all crypto related jobs can be done remotely you could even go so far as to argue that the cryptocurrency industry thrives under these sorts of extreme conditions since a portion of the trillions of dollars in stimulus money being dished out by governments ends up in the crypto space and that means more crypto jobs are created the second advantage of working in crypto is that it's an industry that's still very much in its infancy this means that just like the cryptocurrency market early participants stand to reap incredible rewards the small close-knit nature of the crypto industry makes it very easy to move between employers and rise up the ranks once you get your foot in the door moreover the intense competition between crypto firms and their incredible demand for labor means that there is little room for any sort of employee discrimination or affirmative action policies if you can do a good job it doesn't matter what you look like what you believe or whatever combination of chromosomes you have some crypto companies don't even care about your credentials if you can reliably do the work this along with the network effects i just mentioned means you could very easily find yourself in an executive position at companies like binance and masari in just a few years time i reckon it would take you at least a decade and a hell of a lot of ass kissing to land a position like that at tech giants like google or facebook the third advantage of working in the crypto industry is that you'll never stop learning unchained podcast host laura shin previously worked at newsweek the wall street journal and new york times she quit all three jobs within three years and went full time into cryptocurrency because it was like quote turning over a multi-faceted intellectual gem you need to look no further than the videos on this channel to see that the amount of content in crypto is endless there are also new developments and topics coming to the forefront on an almost daily basis so if you want a job that's constantly changing engaging and challenging i can almost guarantee that you'll find it in the crypto industry that said keeping up with the fast pace of the crypto space is not for the faint of heart this brings me to the first disadvantage of working in crypto although the demand for labor in crypto makes it easy to move up the ranks it also means that you're going to be working your butt off to compensate for the constant shortage of employees in your department and you'll be expected to do the job better than the same employee at the crypto company you're competing against from time to time you're going to have to postpone doing other things you love to get the job done and during bull markets this may also require sacrificing sleep for days at a time to make matters worse there are no guarantees that you will still have a job once the bull market is over that's the second disadvantage of working in crypto your employment is fundamentally dependent on the same volatile assets that you hold on to for dear life assuming you do keep your crypto job well into the next bear market if governments around the world collectively decide to ban cryptocurrencies five or ten years from now by that point you may be so specialized in your particular niche that you'll have a hard time finding work outside of the crypto space so in short working in crypto is the same as hodling crypto it's all or nothing assuming you're ready to take the leap your next step is to find out if you meet the qualifications required to work in the crypto industry while the exact qualifications you need to work in cryptocurrency vary from job to job many of these are actually pretty universal the first is the most obvious and that's an in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrency along with any related topics and technologies as a rule of thumb the more you know about crypto the less the other qualifications are going to matter it just so happens that you can use the content on this channel and the articles on the coin bureau website to learn just about everything you need to know about crypto"", ""are you getting constantly wrecked by the crypto market if you are it might be because you've been making decisions based on bad crypto advice so today i'm going to tell you about some of the worst crypto advice you can get and what you should consider doing instead [Music] before i hit you with the facts there's a misconception i need to whack if you came here looking for financial advice i'm afraid you won't find any of that that's because entertainment and education are the only things i pack please contact a financial advisor if money is what you're trying to attract now if this is the first time you come by my name is guy and this channel is where crypto fudd comes to die that's because i create high quality crypto content that explains the who what when and why coins tokens news and reviews are just a few of the topics i supply so if this is the kind of content that gets you high subscribing to the channel and pinging that notification bell is the correct reply if you're trying to beat the clock you can use the timestamps below to hop just remember that watching until the end will help this video pop now that you know the plot let's look at the crappy crypto advice that's keeping you in a knot the first piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is a timeless classic and that's that you should buy a crypto when it's at or near its all-time high this tends to happen because you've either been led to believe that this crypto will continue to pump or because prices keep pumping while you watch and you start to feel the fomo and of course when you buy the price starts to crash and you end up at a 30 to 50 percent loss within days sometimes the loss is enough for you to sell especially if another crypto catches your eye here's what you can do instead start by assuming that if you're hearing about a crypto because it's pumping then you're already late to the game and are therefore at a high risk of getting wrecked next pop open that kryptos price on coin market cap or coin gecko set the time frame to maximum and see whether the current pump is sustainable or not if you're not sure then pull up the charts for that crypto on your favorite crypto exchange set the chart to daily and slap on the bollinger band indicator if prices are popping out the top then you're too late now you can learn more about how to spot the top using the link in the description the second piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a certain cryptocurrency because its price tag is low and that means it's going to make you rich if it gets as big as bitcoin oddly enough the cryptocurrencies that fall into this category tend to have the most militant communities and chances are that they're the ones who gave you this advice and of course when you buy the price starts to crash and it's only when your portfolio is down 50 that you realize the price tag doesn't matter so here's what you can do instead start by ignoring the price tag of cryptocurrency and focus instead on its market cap this is because it's the market cap that ultimately determines how much a crypto can pump or dump don't forget that it goes both ways next ask yourself how large this cryptocurrency's market cap could realistically grow i.e how much investment this cryptocurrency could realistically see and by when spoiler it's not going to have a bigger market cap than bitcoin or ethereum regardless of what the fanboys say if you're not sure how big a crypto will grow then check out the other crypto projects in its category and see how it stacks up against its competition primarily when it comes to social engagement and monthly active users if applicable you can learn more about crypto categories using the link in the description the third piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a certain cryptocurrency because it's being shield by someone popular such as a musician politician or an electric car company ceo what makes this advice so bad is that it can come with the illusion of legitimacy particularly when someone tells you about this crypto before it pumps and you manage to get in early eventually however the prices start to crash and maybe you double down and buy the dip once or twice before you realize that you should have gotten out a long time ago as prices approach zero here's what you can do instead start by being aware that celebrity promotion is a huge red flag since quality crypto projects do not require any marketing especially not the kind of marketing that explicitly targets inexperienced retail investors next check to see whether the crypto project being pushed actually has potential this includes stuff like a clear use case that creates demand a vesting and inflation schedule that doesn't introduce too much supply and a unique design that sets it aside from its competitors most of this information can be found in a crypto project's white paper and you can learn how to read those using the link in the description the fourth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to buy a cryptocurrency just because it was mentioned by a popular youtuber similarly to buying a crypto because it's pumping this advice tends to be given shortly after a youtuber posts a video about the crypto project which is literally the worst time to buy and of course when you buy there is a chance others will see it as an opportunity to take profits and sell and then you blame the youtuber for your losses even though they told you time and time again that their videos are not financial advice and crypto trading bots automatically buy and sell the cryptos they're talking about when a video is posted here's what you can do instead start by realizing that you should only be using crypto youtube videos as part of your own research and remembering that youtubers don't always get everything right next check to see if the youtuber in question is getting paid to talk about certain crypto projects or holds the coin or token they're talking about as part of their personal portfolio as most of you will already know i do not do paid videos i only talk about crypto projects i personally believe in and always tell you whether the crypto i'll be talking about is part of my personal crypto portfolio at the start of every video you can see how my crypto portfolio performed in 2021 by using the link in the description and you can find out what my crypto portfolio looks like now by subscribing to my weekly newsletter also in the description the fifth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to trust the stuff you read on social media about a crypto project if you're a regular user of twitter or reddit you've probably seen no shortage of posts that make you feel fomo about certain crypto projects and make you feel fud about others sometimes these posts can be very convincing and that causes you to buy or sell a crypto at the wrong time resulting in massive losses or missed gains here's what you can do instead start by being aware that a lot of the people who aggressively spread fomo and fud on social media are either being paid or have invested so much time and money into a crypto project that their bias has gotten the best of them next do your own research to determine whether what they're saying is true or false pro tip if the information they're giving isn't publicly available or requires talking directly with a member of the team to confirm you're probably dealing with a coin you can find out what other characteristics coins tend to have by watching my video about that using the link in the description the sixth piece of crypto advice that's sure to get you wrecked is to keep all your cryptocurrency on a custodial platform such as a cryptocurrency exchange or a crypto savings app proponents of this approach push the idea that these platforms are just as safe as self-custody and you might as well earn some interest on your idle coins and tokens when you're not trading right""]"
14,13,142,13_life_job_work_working,"['life', 'job', 'work', 'working', 'money', 'kids', 'success', 'mindset', 'things', 'circle']","[""what's up guys it's Graham here so ever since I was a kid I've been fascinated with the secrets of what makes somebody financially successful to be honest I really just wanted to figure out why some people were good with money versus why others were bad with money and as it began improving on my own Financial Journey it quickly became apparent that many people are making some rather serious mistakes without even realizing it so these are those nine mistakes and also a big thank you to hostinger for sponsoring this video but more on that later number one we have lifestyle inflation this is what happens when your spending increases right alongside with your income so as soon as you begin making more you start spending more now most of the time it starts off pretty innocently like you get a raise at work so you can finally upgrade your wardrobe or drive a slightly newer car go into dinner a little bit more often but that comes at a cost I'll tell you firsthand once you begin spending more all of those extra little luxuries quickly become necessities and before you know it you need to start making even more money to pay for a more expensive lifestyle that you very quickly become accustomed to now anecdotally when it came to myself throughout my 20s I was very aware of this I became hyper focused on not inflating my lifestyle and I made sure that my spending was in no way dictated or affected by how much money I made at the time my entire mindset was that if I could live like I was broke throughout my 20s while working as hard as possible I could do whatever I wanted in my 30s and to a large extent that came true for more than a decade I daily drove a used Toyota Prius I never lived in anything more luxurious than an 800 square foot duplex in the mid city of Los Angeles I saved at any chance I got and now everything that I buy is sustained indefinitely by those sacrifices so I would say instead of spending more money do your best to keep your expenses as low as possible and then save the difference number two not tracking your expenses if there's one difference that I've noticed between people who have money and people who don't is that one of them is more likely to stick with the budget"", ""so I realized that like with most things in life you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't if I work really really really hard there's a lot of negative impacts with that lots of negative side effects if I don't work at all or if I work when I call not working at all which is like a normal schedule then guess what that's also very very bad because then you have all this extra time where you're just kind of feeling pointless so I thought about this a lot and I came up with the Perfect Analogy that explains what's going on here imagine you are a ship sailing out in Rough Waters on a long long Voyage to a beautiful destination that you really want to get to you may need to dock many ports along the way for repairs and maintenance especially if the weather conditions were bad and trust me they'll be bad but you see that necessary docking period it's only for a short period of time after you dock and after you get those repairs and maintenance it's time to get back out on the water sitting at the dock forever wastes the ship and destroys its purpose we are ships meant to be sailed we can choose to go out on the Seas or sit at the dock rotting away slowly both are very very painful but one one gets you to the destination or at least get you farther to the destination but it is our job to do the best we can and I realized that when I'm dead I don't want people to look back on my life and be like yeah that Charlie guy he kept anxiety out of his life he was very very balanced but you know he didn't do much with his life he never really accomplished much he never pushed the envelope or did anything worth having anxiety for or being out of balance four he'll be forgotten soon and who cares there is plenty of more memorable people out there in fact the Charlie from Charlie bit my finger will always be the more impactful Charlie at least he had the balls to bite that finger folks I want people to say that that Charlie guy he was a massive earthquake and he built something Brick by Brick that inspires tons and tons and tons of people I want people to say rain or shine that Charlie guy showed up in full force it didn't matter if there was a hurricane outside he was there working he was there trying to make an impact he was there trying to do something that could Inspire the next generation of people so with that in mind I am ushering in a new era of zip Trader and I invite you on board to set sail with us we are ready to leave the docks and get over to the next destination my long-term vision for zip Trader is to be the biggest Beacon of stock market Energy Research and education on planet Earth I don't want every single person that comes into contact with us to be made so much better as a result one day I want to look at the next depressed and lonely 15 year old kid who just lost his mom to cancer and be inspired like the 15 year old Charlie was by the stories of others and in order to do that folks we must leave the comfort zone of only being on YouTube and yes that is what the title of this video is all about for the first stage of this though I do need your help I need a way to be in contact with you I need a way to provide you with this new research and this new value that we're going to be rolling out in the coming weeks and months and in order to do that I need your email I've gone ahead and put a link to subscribe to our email list down below and unlock our free research reports that will soon start being sent out on a weekly basis to our subscribers I promise the emails will only contain content that provide value and if you don't like them you could easily unsubscribe at any point but if you have found value in the videos on our Channel I guarantee you you will find Value in these free emails now moving on Final Point how are we going to pay for it as you might imagine this process of expansion is going to be very very expensive it's going to cost a lot of money to provide the next level of products and services and websites and research and overall information that aligns with our goals and all of this is going to happen when I believe we are heading into a massive massive macroeconomic crisis"", ""and once you realize it it's life-changing not to mention being able to negotiate is probably one of the most important skills that you will ever learn in your entire life because this affects the trajectory of everything moving forward so in terms of how you could use these strategies to put you even further ahead there's one more aspect to this that you could use to your advantage and unfortunately most people don't even realize that they should be doing this although before we go into that even though we usually talk about taking care of your Investments I'll be honest from my experience I tend to do the best work and make the most amount of money when I eat better and exercise on a regular basis in fact for the last three months I've made it my goal to exercise for at least 30 minutes every single day and our sponsor co-pilot was able to make that a reality you start by answering a few quick questions about your goals and preferences and then from there you'll get matched with a personalized one-on-one Fitness coach who works around your schedule to craft the routine that's focused on consistency this includes a detailed onboarding call where you'll discuss your lifestyle nutrition and fitness goals and then from there you'll get access to Habit logging daily goals and in-app support directly from your coach for example I am really bad at making sure I drink enough water throughout the day so my coach was able to create a plan to keep me accountable to actually follow through which otherwise I probably wouldn't have done it plus with copilot no access to the gym is required you're able to get unlimited in-app text messages and video calls with your coach and the entire program is crafted around a routine that fits your life and your schedule best of all they help work alongside with you to help reach your goals with friendly reminders and check-ins that work to keep you from falling off track not to mention after following the routines and sticking with it I feel better I work better I think clearer and the benefits go so much further than just exercising because of that it's easy to see why their clients are nine times more

we've mentioned so far one of the most immediate things that you could begin doing right now is to either build or improve your credit score the fact is the credit history in your late teens and early 20s is going to help you tremendously in the future anytime that you want to buy a house get a car obtain a business loan and negotiate terms from the standpoints that you're a responsible borrower who's never missed a payment and plus it's incredibly easy but before we go into some of the tips to immediately improve your credit score I just want to get this out there that I was the one who learned all of these things the hard way point blank I grew up thinking that credit cards were bad that anyone who used them were irresponsible and as a result I just paid cash for everything little did I know that was complete backwards thinking and I didn't realize that until every single Bank denied me for getting a mortgage on my first property because I had zero credit history to be honest that experience taught me that we live in a world where your credit score matters a lot regardless of how much you make and save and if you want to effectively build your wealth while paying as little interest to the banks as possible it all comes down to this first go ahead and open up a free credit card with no annual fee second treat the credit card like it's an extension of your bank account and if you can't afford to buy something outright in cash you definitely can't afford to buy it on a credit card""]"
15,14,122,14_bitcoin_chart_bullish_moving average,"['bitcoin', 'chart', 'bullish', 'moving average', 'moving', 'bull', 'signal', 'average', 'weekly', 'bear']","[""right I've been saying that that is the confirmation for me that the bull market is here once we break through that and that's going up to around $16,000 so when we break that I will be very confident that were in that bull market territory especially because this has happened very quick now that's me that's my own data analysis on these markets what I'm seeing on the charts it's not me being bearish in fact it's me actually being very bullish because if we've seen so many gains right in such a short period of time and we can actually measure this from a date range perspective from that second higher low at the bear market to that swing high that we just had 154 days we had some incredible gains and I'm still saying that we're not even in the bull market yet that just imagine my thoughts on what the next bull market will will bring now the quickness of it 154 days to see such gains and and and to see us test such a key resistance area namely that reads that Fibonacci retracement right here now out of that last bear markets right and that that second higher low that we had in that last bear market back here August 2015 Bitcoin took a lot longer we're talking 300 days to get to the fibonacci resistance area so it took two times as long in that last bear market to test this area before finally breaking through and it actually happened after the having of 2016 in July now look how much quicker things have happened so if Bitcoin was kind of on the same trajectory and going at the same pace 300 some days would be right around here November 2019 before we actually test this Fibonacci channel we'd have another 150 days or so before this happened but it's already happened right so bitcoin is and you can even just see it on the charts it's just moving quicker and all this happening why bitcoin is gaining strength and its dominance is incredibly bullish to me and so when we go to our zoomed out chart a link is in the description below of this charts its explanation is there as well on what's going on here technically but when we go to this chart right and and we look at all right I have around a year later from Bitcoin having and this actually I do not I do not know how these things get changed but around a year later from the Bitcoin having of 2020 we have our next higher high you know at the top of a bull market all-time high now things like this can totally be changed right"", ""this Buy Signal because it happened right before the having called the bull market rallied the Mark at nearly 19 000 the next confirmed Buy Signal was confirmed on July 2015 and that happened roughly one year before the having event and as you can see see the market went into a rally of depending on how you measure it between six thousand percent and ten thousand percent skipping these three confirmed buy signals because they're honestly just repeats of this bull market confirmation we get to this sixth confirmed Buy Signal in the history of Bitcoin this Buy Signal signaled the end of the bear Market the beginning of the new bull market and it happened roughly one year pre having just over one year pre-halving from this Buy Signal Bitcoin would rally one thousand one hundred and forty percent in the span of the next two years and it called the bull market as you can see we've just had a weekly chart Buy Signal flash it's about one year before the having that it was confirmed and as you can see the other three times that this has happened in the history of Bitcoin we have had a bull market ensue within six to twelve months in fact not only has a bull market ensued in the next six to 12 months Bitcoin has also gone on to absolutely smash all-time high this time Bitcoin set an all-time high 3 750 higher than the previous one at thirty dollars the 2016-17 bull market confirmed by Lux algo here in July of 2015 set an all-time high 1652 percent higher than all-time high and the Lux algo Buy Signal that was confirmed April 1st of 2019 LED Bitcoin to set an all-time high 275 percent higher than the previous all-time high at twenty thousand dollars by forcing Bitcoin to Rally to seventy thousand dollars now I'm not here in this video to tell you exactly how far Bitcoin will rally but historically this Buy Signal means that Bitcoin is going to at least 70 000 and honestly I'd put the mark closer to 120 to 150 000 over the next two to three years I have never in my career in technical analysis found an indicator where on just multiple different charts not every chart but on multiple different charts literally has a 100 perfect track record and by the way if you were looking at the chart earlier and you said but Jeb there's some buy signals you didn't talk about that's because before I started the video I went through and I weeded out all the buy signals that were not confirmed by Trend catcher we only looked at the ones that had confirmation"", ""so let's go ahead and dive right on into it the first thing I want to talk about is this crash on Bitcoin here Bitcoin had been rallying for about four months and finally we've reached all the way up to about thirteen thousand nine hundred dollars and had a massive sell-off we actually happen to be live-streaming during it this sell-off Bitcoin crashed two thousand dollars in three minutes it was ridiculous and when you see something like that happen that is obviously going to be a longer-term sign of bearishness clearly the Bears are in control now a lot of that had to do with the thin order books and Bitcoin did just kind of fall through the floor but part of the reason the order books were so thin and there weren't as many buy orders on exchange with because people realize that bitcoin was getting into overbought territory that's something that we talked about in the Bitcoin Academy is the gut feeling of kind of getting an idea of where what the market is doing why it's doing it and having that feeling inside of you without having to rely on technical indicators the entire point of technical indicators in fact has a little bit of a tangent is to give you guys kind of an aura and a feeling about what the market is going to do you're not necessarily just supposed to trade off of one technical indicator you're supposed to trade off of what multiple of them say and what the bigger picture each of these technical indicators is contributing to paint says they are telling you something about the market and your gut can tell you the exact same thing from your previous experience that's a very important part of trading like I said that's why we talk about that in the crypto currency technical analysis Academy anyway from there Bitcoin continued trending to the downside and this was very clearly a bearish trend one of the things you're gonna hear me say a couple times in this video is the trend is your friend right up until it ends guys the trend is your friend right until it ends it's very important that you remember that because normally the market when it's moving is not going to be in the mode in the in the business of trend reversal what is normally going to be doing is it's in the business of continuing the same trend that it's already in for example here guys bitcoin made it one high two highs three hides or five six before it finally made a higher high it was in the business of a downtrend right here it wasn't in the business of trend reversals we didn't see one two three four five six seven trend reversals we saw one two three four five six seven lower highs so typically trends are going to happen a trends are going to be followed a lot more than they're going to be broken and that's very important for trading because you can reasonably assume that at least more than half of the time if you make a trade based on which direction the trend is going you're probably going to end up being profitable in that trade and that's a very important assumption for your trading because a lot of your trading is going to be either at the reversal of a trend or in the midst of a trend and then you want to try and predict where that trend is going to end from there though guys bitcoin did fall down to here to a level of support that we talked about around eleven thousand five hundred dollars to eleven thousand seven hundred dollars it's a bit of a zone right in here but this is the line we're going to work with just know that there is a little bit of margin for error there bitcoin did fall down all the way to ten thousand two hundred dollars came back up got resistance and then made a higher low now this is interesting Bitcoin made a higher low here and we're gonna talk about some RSI divergence over here in a second but Bitcoin made a higher low here and that is one of the early warning signs that a trend is about to reverse notice that we have the same lows over here and we have lower highs we were obviously in a downtrend we were actually in fact in a descending triangle pattern which we did break a bearish out of but when we started seeing higher highs or excuse me higher lows guess what happened next we saw a higher high then we saw a higher high from that a higher low we saw but this may actually come up and create a higher high this very well may be the reversal of a trend right here but we want to wait and see on that and we're gonna get to that in a little bit anyway from there Bitcoin did continue at this upwards trend we did have a lower low right here which could be an early warning sign of a downtrend but a very well may not be we want to give that a little bit more time to develop anyway guys now we're kind of caught up on up to speed on what bitcoin has done here over the last few days or so now I'm gonna go in here and cherry-pick a couple of different trades that you could have made I was looking to make a couple of these trades a couple of them unnoticed in hindsight and the two that are the one in fact that I was going to make at the time""]"

some other coin that is not yet supported on coin based on Gemini on Kraken so what I would recommend this is me is to simply download Exodus have your money on Exodus and should the time come and you're looking for a very quick swap so that you can dump your money back into coin base to send it to your bank account this is one of the easiest ways that I found to cash out of the market and it'll probably be this way for quite some time until these major exchanges end up having around 30 40 50 60 70 different alt coins but as of now it may take a bit of effort a couple of clicks but this is the easiest way for you to get your money back into your bank account the last thing - is also a very large cryptocurrency exchange if I'm not mistaken there either number one or two compared to coin base in the world right now they're extremely popular they have mentioned many times before that they are adding fiat support I guess because of the rules and regulations within the United States they have announced that they're going to be trying to add euro support as in Fiat pairing so you'll also be able to then send them euros by coins and also swap out of that to send euros to your bank account I assumed as time goes on you will then be able to as well send US dollars in Japanese yen what have you but at the moment if you are looking to use coin by Nance I would definitely recommend them as well but then also I mean the cryptocurrency space for what it's worth is still in its infancy it's still relatively new so all the kinks have not been worked out but it can be very simplified in the easiest ways that I found or that I've offered to tell a lot of people like I said this is not or these are not the only ways for you to cash out of the market these are just some of the easiest ways in most simplified ways I tried to tell you the largest and or most well-known crypto changes that we have out there and this is kind of what it comes down to I would definitely recommend buy Nance coinbase Kraken and also downloading Exodus or maybe even reading through the exodus website to do your own research and figuring out if you want to use this"", ""but these are the methods that I have found that a lot of other people have been using some of them that I have used myself and these I think are at least the safest ways or I try to I pretty much blanket cover some of the easiest ways to if the cryptocurrency market goes up to a certain amount if the market gets too hot and you decide that you want to pull your money out to be able to get some of your profits back these are kind of the simplest ways to kind of do it first up we have a coin base for those who do not know coin base is probably the largest cryptocurrency exchange that we have in the world right now they're also one of the most trusted they are the most not verified they have gone through all the legal hoops that they have to go through they're located in the United States but they still allow for international purchases and stuff like that as well they definitely handle people in the US if you are in the European Union and as well as if you are in the UK if I'm not mistaken a couple of days ago they also just added British pounds as well for people I know a couple of people in Europe who have also used coin base and they said that they had no issue at all I guess it has to be something on the lines of transfers I have not heard any complaints from people using coin base and people in the US should as well no coin base as well I recommend them simply because of how simple they are if you actually sign up and go through their website it's very basic there's nothing difficult about it everything is pretty much clear in your face like everything is kind of laid out it's nothing you won't be using coin base if you're trying to do something difficult or something that takes a lot of effort or something that you have to know technical skills about everything in on coin base is pretty much like there's an option for by there's also an option for sell there's an option for this is an option for that it's one of the easiest crypto places that I've ever seen in my entire life they've definitely done well to give you just exactly what you need and nothing more on the entire thing of coinbase they do have a verification process as many of these other things do if you have been in crypto for a while or if you are how do I say this if you were planning on taking out a significant amount of money if the market goes up or even right now depending on when you were trying to cash out the these websites have ways for you to verify your identity and it's usually through showing your passport showing a state ID or showing your country's ID sometimes you can also get in contact with them as well to kind of expedite the process or tell them if you have a particular you know I am in this country"", ""and then you can select to buy it either once daily weekly etc whatever you want and you can enter how much depending on how much you want to invest and then click on review order and at this point you can enter in the payment method and pick which one you want and then place the order that's it hotel for dear life before we get into the next step there's this next part that's very important that i want you to understand because if you think you're going to become a millionaire with bitcoin overnight and then just cash out there's a few limitations that you might run into and here's what they are if you're using gemini's ach transfer system there's a 15 000 daily limit but a 30 000 monthly limit and if you're gonna withdraw money to your bank account there's a 100 000 daily limit but if you're gonna buy bitcoin with debit cards you can only buy 500 at a time per debit card and like i said before don't use debit cards the fees are not worth it but that's important to know if you're super excited you want to buy bitcoin only to realize that you can't buy a whole one using debit cards or whatever else you're gonna use and if you're gonna use coinbase it's a similar structure in that it depends on the level of verification so the more information you give to those sites like your passport your social the higher your limit will be but hopefully now that you've bought a bitcoin toss a like to your witcher and let's go to the next step because once the bitcoin settles into your account there's two different paths that you can take either the cold route or my personal favorite the hot route bam just when you least expect it you get the fire wallet don't try that at home and what i mean by that is you can actually just keep your bitcoin on the exchange itself and that's considered a hot wallet now the upside for doing this is that you have instant liquidity right because your bitcoin can be sold right away you can exchange it for a different coin you can make it earn interest on a different website and all of those things are great but the downside is that you have to trust that it's those exchanges or businesses that will keep your money safe from computer wizards that try to steal your money the second round we can take is the cold storage route which is where we take our coins offline and put it onto the blockchain via something called the ledger nano wallet which i'll show you in a minute but first i want to show you the hot wallet route which is what i use because i think your money should always be earning interest and making you passive income so what i like to use is blockfy.com and you can actually use this code right here to get up to 250 worth of free bitcoins depending on how much you fund your account but if you choose to go this route please follow these next few steps very carefully go to the upper part of the website where you'll see deposit you can click on that and then select the coin you bought from the brokerage""]"

right here so there we go I just bought it"", ""so if investors are constantly buying and selling shares on the secondary market how our stock price is determined well the price of a stock is largely governed by the basic economic principles of supply and demand plain and simple at any given time there's a maximum price someone is willing to pay for a certain stock and a minimum price someone is willing to sell shares of that stock for think of the stock market as an auction with some investors bidding for the stocks and other investors that are willing to sell if there's a lot of demand for stock investors will buy shares quicker than sellers want to get rid of them and the price will move higher to reflect that on the other hand if more investors are selling a stock and buying the market price will drop now you might be thinking to yourself what if people don't want to sell their shares how can you buy them in order to ensure that there's always a liquid marketplace for stocks on an exchange individuals known as market makers act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers market makers buy and hold shares and continually list quotes to buy and sell those shares the highest offer to buy shares listed from the market maker at any given time is known as the bid and the lowest offered selling price is known as the ask the difference between those two is called the spread the main reason for using market makers as a system as opposed to simply letting investors buy and sell shares directly between one another is to ensure that there's always a buyer to match with every seller and vice versa if you want to sell a stock you don't need to wait until a buyer wants your exact number of shares a market maker will buy them right away now if you want to buy a stock you'll have to do it through a broker basically someone that is licensed to trade stocks on an exchange a broker maybe an actual person who will tell you what to buy and sell but in today's day and age it's probably an online broker that processes each transaction electronically when you buy a stock here's a simplified version of how it works you tell your broker what stock you want to buy and how many shares you want your broker relays that order to the exchange and a market maker sells you the shares at the current market price then those shares are delivered to your account you've probably heard statements such as the market is up or the stock beat the market often when discussing the stock market people generalize the stock market to a stock index stock indices such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average are a representation of the performance of a large group of stocks but not the entire exchange and are often used as a benchmark to compare the performance of individual stocks to an entire portfolio for example the S&P 500 index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States indexes are a convenient way to discuss an approximation of what is happening in the stock market but they do not fully represent the entire stock market the beauty of a stock market index like the S&P 500 is that they aren't just a measure of how stocks are doing they can also be a way for folks that are new to investing to easily put their money to work thanks to Jack Bogle and Vanguard the average investor can buy a fund that tracks an index like the S&P 500 and pay a tiny fee to do so making it easy and cheap to start investing folks that are looking to get into the market for the first time we recommend doing exactly that look for an ETF or a mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500 and boom you are immediately a part owner in 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States if you're looking for some

lesson of the day in our last lesson we continued our module on how to play stock trades with a look at position sizing and how to buy and sell stocks in today's lesson I'm going to continue this discussion with a look at the most basic type of order that traders used to enter and exit the market a market order so let's get started today's electronic platforms give traders many options for entering and exiting trades which include the ability to tie automatic trade parameters to your stock trades so that they will be executed only if certain conditions are met the most basic order type that a trader can use to enter and exit the market is what is known as a market order a market order is an order that is sent to be executed at the current market price regardless of what that price is when your order is executed the advantage of using a market order is that you are pretty much guaranteed to be filled on your order regardless of how fast the market is moving the disadvantage is that you do not know where your order will end up being filled until after you receive confirmation from your broker of the fill price it is important for traders to understand that just because they click to buy or sell at a certain rate on their platform this does not mean that they will be executed at that price the difference between the price a trader clicks to buy or sell a stock and the price that they are filled at on their trade is called slippage factors including the volatility or amount of price movement in the market at the time the order is placed the time of day the trader is trading and how active the stock is that they have chosen to trade affect the quality of execution that a trader will receive on their orders in general the more active the overall market is and the greater the amount of volume traded in a stock on average the more liquid a stock is and the better execution or fill a trader can expect now that we understand this let's log into a thinkorswim demo accounts and place our first stock trade using a market order if you've not registered for and downloaded a thinkorswim demo account I encourage you to hit the pause button and click the demo registration link above this video so you can download the platform and follow along as well once you have logged into the platform go to the trade page and type the ticker symbol for Microsoft MSFT under where it says symbol and then + press enter this will populate the trade tab with the quote from Microsoft for this example we are going to say that we feel the that Microsoft is going to trade higher so since we would want to buy in this scenario we're going to click on the ask price once you do this the order entry box will appear at the bottom of the platform which will automatically be populated with the default parameters for stock trades looking across the window from left to right you can see that the window is set to buy 100 shares of Microsoft stock if we wanted to change the quantity you can simply use the up or down arrows on the right-hand side of the quantity column to move in increments of 100 or you can type in the amount that you'd like to trade for this example we're going to trade 100 shares the expiration strike and Link columns are not relevant for this type of trade so you can ignore those under the order column it is currently set to execute a limit order which we are going to learn about in our next lesson since we want to send in order to be executed at the best price available in the market we're going to use the drop-down menu to change that to read market under the rules column it should say day which means that the order will be executed based on the thinkorswim normal market hours execution rules leave this set today for now as we will cover this option in more detail in a later lesson once you have all the parameters of the order window how you want them click on the confirm and send button this will bring up the order confirmation window where you can check all the details of the trade one more time before sending the order once you've confirmed that everything is correct click the send button to execute the trade after doing this the order will show up in the order book at the bottom of the platform as a working order and normally in less than a second the oil will show as filled in the order book you've just executed a by market order for 100 shares of Microsoft stock on your paper trading account and can now monitor the trade either from the trade page monitor page of the platform or account tab that's our lesson

protocol it now offers secret surge this is a defy incentives campaign you can earn extra rewards up to four million dollars actually when providing liquidity in secret apps so for instance shade blade Sienna swap or secret swap you can take advantage from April until October there's secret vrf a verifiable random function which is an API it randomly generates numbers and works cross-chain so for instance and just as one example it makes nft minting gaming or Dows secure and when it comes to minting it adds random traits and numbering so in gaming boot boxes or gambling all of this needs to be random and the vrf takes care of this it also emphasizes the start of privacy as a service they also offer packet forward middleware this moves assets or data around in a much simpler way you can now route IBC packets with a single transaction and it's between various chains by the way there's also the IBC emergency button and this can temporarily halt IBC transactions so for instance when

couldn't find any concrete evidence that esg investors are behind this accelerating trend towards hardware as a service in various sectors it wouldn't be surprising given that the trend is inherently esg friendly hardware as a service satisfies environmental criteria because the number of devices in circulation can be reduced the devices in circulation can be reused and any old devices can be easily recycled as you'll likely need to give back your old device to get a newer version hardware as a service also satisfies social criteria because everyone will have subscription services for the same devices there will be no phone with a better camera or a bigger memory nor a faster or slower or bigger or smaller car and that means everyone will be truly equal hardware as a service satisfies governance criteria because it will put the company producing the product in total control of its creation use and destruction anyways more about esg in the description now unlike most other esg related policies hardware as a service could actually result in actual profits because people will be paying subscription services for just about everything they own until they die notably the subscription costs could be made low enough so that these products are available to more people not just the privileged few in developing countries where most of the demand for these products is currently coming from whereas planned obsolescence was introduced as a means of solving the great depression it looks like hardware as a service is being introduced to prevent another depression from occurring by ensuring consumption continues to increase even as the demographic decline continues now don't get me wrong hardware as a service is unlikely to be forced upon us consumers as we've recently seen with other products applying too much force tends to result in an equal or greater amount of pushback because hey people know something is up when they don't have a choice in the matter"", ""this means that Apple stock trades out just about normal volatility and right now they have a current p/e ratio of twenty three point five three their earnings per share is actually quite a bit higher than it should be and this is because Apple loves to buy back its own stock the dividend yield for Apple is currently at one point one three percent based on its current valuation if we take a look at the six-month chart you can see that it hits high at the start of 2020 and then dip down to the low 200s in mid-march since then it's recovered back to about 90 percent of its all-time highs not that Apple has been its expected earnings for at least the last four quarters but you can also see that they did not issue any guidance for q2 of 2020 due to the uncertain markets and in 2019 they had revenue of about 260 billion dollars with profits of around 55 billion dollars let's talk about some of the news right now and later on I'll go into a more in-depth analysis so with the up and coming 5g Network Apple is supposedly pushing back its newest iPhone 12 by about one month this means that we should expect these new phones by October in terms of growth apples services revenue is up 17% to thirteen point three five billion dollars for the March quarter and their wearables and accessories division also gained about twenty two point five percent to six point two eight billion dollars in the same quarter now going back to why Warren Buffett loves Apple so much he actually normally does not like tech companies at all it's a sector that he doesn't really understand but he likes the view Apple as a consumer product company he says that he believes Apple is the best business in the world and would love to own the entire company if it were possible he loves the customer loyalty expanding services high profit margins and extremely strong balance sheet speaking of balance sheet let's do a quick but deeper analysis at this company's financials so Apple's current enterprise value is one point two nine trillion dollars right now this is just about where the market cap is and we talked about how Warren Buffett likes buying companies when they are currently under the enterprise value so right now it is a toss-up whether or not he would currently invest in Apple's also take a look at its forward p/e ratio of twenty four point two seven this means that its current share price is twenty four point two seven times the expected earnings per share""]"

must this level of support must have been tested multiple times and if it has been tested multiple times i want the lowest bodies of the support level to be touched with my level my box that i draw so this k in this case we have one touch we have two touches that means in this area is where i'm looking for possible buy trades here's the second part we've now utilized the 50 ema we're utilizing a major level of structure support and what we're looking for at this level is not a complete reversal we're not looking for this market to head higher and start trading way up here i'm looking at this level to provide a bounce before trend continuation to the downside with that being the case this is when we utilize lower time frames so we push down we're now closer to my level we're actually in the level now and what i would do at this point hopefully you're following along hopefully you've taken notes up to this point is right now my other two conditions are already met we're trading below the 50 ema we're at a major level of structure that's been tested multiple times that i'm looking for a brief bounce out of i'm gonna go down to lower time frames and look for possible entries what are my possible entries they consist of double bottoms hammer candles buying pressure of some kind a big green candle would be fine so let's push the market forward here we get nothing there"", ""so I can show you how to place trades on a live account in the trading view platform but here if we zoom in a little closer we actually have a really nice Candlestick pattern we have a rejection right here this otherwise known as a shooting star candle comes up this is buyers trying to take control throughout this entire Wick but when price hits this area of structure combined with our 20 EMA what happens sellers say no sellers create this long Wick now that's good but waiting for some added confirmation can make things a little more accurate so what happens next next we get a large or large comparison to the previous candle at least in terms of the body a large red candle so this is what I need to place a trade at this point the conditions we've already discussed have been met my entry is right here with our long Wicked candle followed by a red Candle In the Zone remember that has to happen after the conditions are met so with this being the case this is how I would like to place this trade I would go ahead and enter there which I'm about to enter I have to take it off Market replay mode and actually enter the trade which I'll do again in just a second I'm going to check out the ATR which is what I use to play stop losses the ATR of this candle is right up here it's right at 45 Pips right now by the way with the ATR you discount the last number so that is 0.45 or 45 Pips 45 Pips on the ATR which means I'm gonna go about 40 to 45 Pips above the high of this wig to have a safe stop loss so that's going to be about 91 Pips which gets me above my major level I'm going to look for about a 1.4 to 1 reward your risk ratio which is the reward to risk that I personally like to use a lot of the time once price gets to this little level here I will probably move my stop loss to break even if we do push down we may go straight up and hit my stop loss I have no idea but this trade is giving me a positive expectancy because of all the things we've already discussed all the conditions coming together along with these Candlestick patterns gives me a positive expectancy so with that being the case let's go ahead and remove Market replay so I can place this trade live with you and if you haven't noticed what did we accomplish by going through this entire trading process we accomplished c e s t a completely rules-based way of trading and rules based strategy so let's go take out a live trade here on the Euro again getting out of Market replay mode"", ""so I'm not interested in trying to capture a Buy trade from here because we could very well see something like this and a continuation down for that reason I want some added confirmation of waiting for this level of resistance to be broken before I decide okay we could see this reversal and we could see prices continue to head higher so that's what I'm waiting for at this point and that's what I was thinking preemptively before placing this exact trade let's push prices forward as you can see just one candle later we do in fact break and close Above This level now at this point for this reversal setup in this reversal strategy you're learning today at this point I'm waiting for a pullback and a Candlestick pattern we'll break that down a little more when we go through the CEST the full strategy rules for this but just know that that's what I'm waiting for at this point and as you can see if we continue pushing forward here we end up getting exactly that we get the push up from our support level the breaking close above the previous level of resistance a pullback and a nice engulfing candle right here now for me that was enough to enter the trade I ended up getting involved a couple of candles later when I actually saw this trade and what I'm going to do now is play you a clip from me exiting this trade live so here we are back on the pound Swizz as you can see right here is where I exited this trade and that was for about a two to one reward to risk ratio so now let's break this down using c e s t as I stated before this stands for conditions the entry you're going to use the stop loss you're going to use and the target you're going to use for veterans of the channel you've heard me say this about a thousand times but if you're new here to the trading Channel anytime you place a trade you need to have set rules for each of these you need to understand and know the conditions you were using were you using supply and demand where you're using support and resistance where you're using a specific indicator what were your rules did we need to be above a moving average did we need to pull back to a previous level of resistance all of that would be examples of conditions you need to know exactly where you're going to be entering the trade why did you press the buy button was it because of something like this engulfing candle for me that was my reasoning that was my actual entry and you always want to know where you're getting out if you're wrong and where you're going to get out if you're right on the trade that's known as stops and targets so let's break this trade down and break down this entire strategy using CEST so first off I need to see prices break above a previous level of resistance in a reversal manner what I mean by that is prices need to have been pushing lower making new lower highs and lower lows""]"

you could get a car like this 9,000 bucks for a sick BMW do it and laugh at everybody else spend money out their butts while you're buying stocks and real estate thanks everybody follow me on Instagram now I wanted to add a note here that I don't think I made as clear as I wanted to in the video what I wanted to say is look at this look fact that that $9,000 convertible BMW has like every

because it guarantees longevity which allows the investor to be comfortable knowing that there isn't a time limit to their bottles but of course i can't tell you guys about the pros without also telling you about the cons because wine does have costs that come with holding the asset there's a buyer's premium shipping and storage costs insurance and even the initial investment that you have to worry about when it comes to money spent and if that was enough the wine could take up to a decade or longer to reach its maximum value so in short one is a super unique industry with even less investors but like i said it can be a very lucrative investment in the long term and it's a great way to diversify if you have an interest in wine and you want to have something that performs differently from the markets and economy if ever take up wine tasting as a hobby in the future i think investing into it would definitely be an option for me to level up my wine game so now let's talk about number six so usually when people think of cars they think depreciating hunks of metal you drive off a lot and it loses 30 of its value stuff like that this one is interesting because it can make you a lot of money it's super non-traditional but unfortunately you sort of have to have a lot of money to do it and that is buying and selling exotic cars if you guys take a look at john cena and the ford gt that he bought he literally made about one million dollars buying that car at msrp and then selling it and there are tons of examples of other people doing something similar to this now especially with the car market being the way it's been in recent years we've seen prices grow tremendously on both used and new cars for example i bought my ferrari 458 for 175 000 plus tax in late 2021 and its value is probably up at least 10 to 15 000"", ""oh my gosh you got a screaming you have 9 grand look this thing it's freaking awesome $9,000 and you got a convertible I mean there's

been the same for years actually was the same supply for the last Bull Run so like I said when Quant hit its all-time high of 428 dollars its market cap was a little bit over 4 0.8 billion dollars at the time since the supply isn't changing the only thing that is going to change for the coming Bull Run is the numerator the market cap how high can quantum's market cap go if Quant had a 10 billion dollar market cap it would equal out to about 828 dollars per Quant if we 3x the previous market cap from the last all-time high that would be about 13.8 billion in market cap and that would give us about an eleven hundred and fifty dollar Quant and since it's at a hundred dollars going to a thousand is a 10x but to be completely honest with you when I think about all of the utility with this coin how it's going to change the game for the global cross-border payment system it's working with the bank of England to make a CBD it is the road that is connecting the dots of all the other blockchains in existence this coin could change the game so for this price prediction is going to be one of my more bullish price predictions out of all of them I will probably ever do I might be shooting for the Stars just a little bit on this one so for my official price prediction for the top of the next Bull Run for Quan I am thinking somewhere between fifteen hundred dollars and sixteen hundred and fifty dollars where the latter is a market cap of 19.9 billion and like I said with this coin and how well the supply works with it this coin could go much higher than that I'm just trying to be somewhat realistic but remember if Quan had bitcoin's market cap we're looking at a 43 000 coin it's absolutely ridiculous so boom there you go first of all I'd like to thank the community members of quan on Twitter that helped me out with some questions I had for this video to give them a shout out their names are at San nl11 and at the miles Braun thank you guys for your help I really appreciate it and also San nl11 has some really interesting threads on Quan if you want to read them on your own time also on my Twitter at ajrates"", ""Right Around a hundred dollars it hit its all-time high in September 11 2021 at about 428 other coins are super difficult to do price predictions on because their circulating Supply is sort of a moving Target coins like Doge for instance you know Doge prints 14 million new coins every day so you kind of have to do that extra math and see how hard the market cap has to catch up to its inflating Supply Quant is a relief for doing price predictions on because it has a fixed supply of tokens at around 14.8 million notice I said million not billion this is less than Bitcoin if you think about Bitcoin you know it has a little over 19 billion coins in its Supply and how high that price could go and you think to yourself Quant has less coins than Bitcoin I kind of really start to get excited on what's possible for Quan's price action in the future like I said the max Supply is 14.8 million but the circulating Supply is a little over 12 million so there's a little over 2 million coins that are unaccounted for so when are those coins going to enter the supply the truth is it's hard to tell because if you go back on a snapshot to see how many coins were in the supply at the time in say February of 2020 it says Quant has a little over 12 million tokens and then if you look at a snapshot of just last week it says Quant has the same amount of tokens no tokens came out no tokens came in it's gridlocked at that exact number but there's still two million more coins left in its Max Supply it took me a little bit of digging to find this but all coin buzz says that those other 2 million coins are actually held by the company they are also unlocked which means that they could be sold at any time so keep that in mind but at the same time 81 of the tokens are already in its Supply and there's only two million more to go and even if those two million more are added in we're still 5 million less than Bitcoin Supply right now so the supply is super bullish for Quant there's other things I like more about Quant than other tokens as well if you look at a coin like Matic and you realize that the top 100 holders that hold Matic hold 85.8 of the supply that doesn't really feel the best when you buy a coin and you know the top 100 holders hold most of the supply but when you look at a coin like Quant the top 100 holders only hold 37.8 of the supply so Quant is much more friendly in terms of how many whales are holding at the top and it's also more friendly because it has some very very small Supply which means that the price for this coin which is only at a hundred dollars could go absolutely to the Moon think about it like this we've established that Bitcoin has a larger Supply than Quant"", ""maybe even more than what it's worth however let's look at some things that aren't scarce how about like sugar okay sugar used to be very scarce not scarce anymore there's a ton of sugar and it's basically like a penny for a pound it's no value to it well fiat currencies mean the fed itself has said they have infinite money that means there's no scarcity in it whatsoever that means there's no value in it bitcoin however 21 million bitcoin 6 million have already been lost that means there's 15 million bitcoin there's over 30 million millionaires in the world so even if every millionaire wanted to own a bitcoin and look at how popular they're becoming with institutions every millionaire couldn't every millionaire could only own half of the bitcoin you know if every person on the earth if bitcoin the 21 million bitcoin were divided upon every person on earth everybody would only get point zero zero two bitcoin so scarcest asset asset ever that's why you need to take a look at all coins compared to bitcoin because here's the thing bitcoin is going up check the scoreboard it just goes up and up and up and the problem is the human brain can't understand the exponential function in case you guys haven't yet make sure to like subscribe also click the notification bell but the brain can't understand the exponential function warren buffett and einstein have both said that the best thing ever created is compound interest well basically the inverse of compound interest is the exponential function and bitcoin every time there's a halfing it follows along the exponential function that's why we have the stock to flow model that's why we have the bitcoin rainbow chart every halfing the value of bitcoin goes up a whole another order of magnitude it was ten thousand last time it's a hundred thousand this time it'll be a millionth time after that 10 million after that now this isn't completely because of scarcity it's also because they're printing a ton of money this past year the us printed more money than has been created in a quarter of the existence of the united states so they printed 25 of the money that's ever been created in one year and they have another plan to do another two trillion dollar stimulus package coming up soon so fiat money is has no value take a look at zimbabwe take a look at venezuela take a look at germany back whenever they had their huge inflationary thing fiat money goes to zero bitcoin does not go to zero now the errors that you're making

account depending on what platform you're using these are also very flexible they're very simple to create they're less expensive than a trust fund to create and maintain earnings are also taxed at the miners tax rate up to a certain point this is generally going to be a lower tax rate since you're likely making less money and it does allow you the miners to fully take advantage of compound

briefly touch on the power of compound interest before we continue with this video because it's that important so first we have scenario a"", ""investing is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth but before you can invest you need to set up a brokerage account like paying your taxes or making a three-way call it seems difficult but it's actually super easy i'm cyril doin and in this video from the isense money lab we're going to break down how to open a brokerage account and what you need to watch out for first you need to start by deciding what type of account you want and then comparing several online stockbrokers you should be able to choose the one that best meets their needs step 1 determine the type of brokerage account you need what are your investment objectives if you simply want to invest for a rainy day or for a certain relatively near-term goal and don't necessarily want your money tied up until you retired a traditional brokerage account is the way to go these accounts don't have tax advantages you may have to pay tax on investment profits and dividends but you are free to withdraw your money whenever you'd like if you choose a cash account your broker will likely ask you if you want margin privileges which basically means that you can borrow money to buy stocks with the stocks in your portfolio serving as collateral you'll pay interest on the broad money and there are some inherent risks involved with investing on margin that you should be aware of on the other hand if your goal is to save money for retirement an IRA is the best bet traditional IRAs can get you tax deductions when you contribute to them but you won't be able to use your money until you're 59 and a half contributions to Roth IRAs don't give you a tax benefit when you make them but qualified withdraws will be tax-free plus you can withdraw Roth contributions but not your investment profits whenever you want finally if you're self-employed there are some special options for you such as a simple IRA step IRA or individual 401k if you're specifically looking for an IRA check the description for a link to our guide to help you pick the best IRA step 2 compare the costs and incentives some major brokerages charge commissions some don't the costs have generally been coming down for the average investor but you need to know what you're signing up for so that fees don't eat up all your returns it's also important to review the brokers full pricing schedule particularly if you plan on trading anything other than stocks such as options funds or bonds as these often come with their own costs for example many brokers charge 75 cents per option contract on top of their standard commissioner finally many brokers offer incentives in order to attract business and you don't need to be a millionaire to take advantage of them I'm not saying that a good incentive all by itself should sway your decision"", ""but it's important to make sure you're starting on solid footing generally it's best to only invest after you've set aside some savings in an emergency fund and paid down any high interest debt having three to six months of living expenses on hand is helpful in case anything unexpected happens and paying down high interest debt is a guaranteed return that's hard to beat by anything that you'd invested taking care of those things first also allows you to take the long-term approach to investing there are years where the economy is doing well and the stock market is up in years where it's down if you're only investing money you don't need in the short term you can weather that volatility and know that long term growth is on your side also if you're investing money you might need soon it could put you in a position where you have to sell investments at a loss because you need to make a mortgage payment or pay a medical bill and nobody wants that that's all to say that temperament is key it is the most important thing when it comes to investing if you're going into things with the right mindset you can go ahead and open a brokerage account now choosing where to open a brokerage account will largely depend on what you're interested in investing in though it's hard to go wrong with the major discount brokers and major institutions like Vanguard if you want to run down of the major brokers check the description for a link of our broker Center opening a brokerage account is typically a quick and painless process that you can do in a matter of minutes you can easily fund your brokerage account via an EFT transfer by mailing a check or wiring money there are a couple things to keep in mind them first determine what kind of brokerage account you need for most people that are starting out this means choosing between a standard brokerage account or an individual retirement account the main consideration here is why you're investing and how easily you want to be able to access your money if you want easy access or are just investing for a rainy day you'll probably want a standard brokerage account on the other hand if your goal is to build up a retirement nest egg and IRA is a great way to go these accounts come in two varieties traditional or Roth traditional IRAs are funded with pre-tax money which lowers your taxable income in the year you contribute but the money you take retirement will be taxed Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars so there's no immediate tax benefit but you can withdraw the money tax-free in retirement if you're thinking in years go with the standard brokerage account if you're thinking in decades it might make sense to start an individual retirement account the great thing is you don't have to choose you can do both as long as you continue to save money and both account types will allow you to buy stocks mutual funds bonds and ETFs so that's what you need to start investing now on to what you can invest in when most people think investing they think stocks and bonds it's what they hear all the time in the news so we're gonna quick define both of them a stock is an equity stake in a business owning a share of a company means you're a part owner and you're entitled to a sliver of the company's profits if the business succeeds you enjoy your stake in the business being worth more a bond is really depth if you buy a bond you're loaning a sum of money to the issuer for a predetermined period of time in exchange the issuer promises to make regular interest payments at a predetermined rate until the bond comes due and then repay what you lent them upon maturity there are other ways to invest but stocks and bonds are generally the most common now you can put your money to work in stocks and bonds in several different ways you can buy individual stocks and bonds mutual funds that hold stocks and bonds and ETFs that holds Docs and bonds we're going to explore all three options and talk about the pros and cons of each one of the most popular investing vehicles out there is the mutual fund mutual funds are a collection of stocks bonds or other securities that investors can buy a share of and they're wildly popular because rather than having to choose individual stocks or bonds a single mutual fund can instantly give you a well diversified set of investments you can find mutual funds that invest in stocks bonds as well as other types of investments such as commodities within each category there are a variety of sub types such as growth stocks value stocks international stocks and a variety of risk levels if there's something you're interested in investing in there's probably a mutual fund for you most funds are available to all investors even those who only have modest amounts to invest which increases investing access for many beyond that basic definition if nothing else the thing you need to know about mutual funds is that they're actively managed mutual funds and index funds we generally prefer the latter actively managed funds have a manager who's trying to follow a specific strategy to try and provide superior returns unfortunately many of them don't succeed most research shows that due to short-term mindsets active trading and high fees actively managed funds tend to put up worse returns than the major stock market indices like the S&P 500 that's why many investors like us prefer to put our money into index funds an index fund managers job is to simply match the index the fund tracks which takes significantly less time and effort than the analysis and portfolio management involved with actively managed funds because of that index funds typically have significantly lower costs and are virtually guaranteed to match the long-term performance of their underlying index if you're interested in mutual funds be sure to keep an eye on the returns over the one three and five year period and how they compare to the S&P 500 or the funds relevant benchmark you should also look at the funds expense ratio basically how much you have to pay the person managing the fund if it's high the fund better be putting up better returns than the S&P 500 or its relevance benchmark net of fees mutual funds are great for beginners they allow you to instantly be diversified and you'll earn returns that beat most professional investors for example the sp500 mutual funds like the Vanguard V FedEx have allowed folks like you and me to instantly own a piece of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the US enjoy annualized returns of 10 percent per year and pay very little to get started another very popular investing option for folks is the ETF or exchange-traded fund ETFs and mutual funds are basically siblings mutual funds are offered directly through mutual fund companies and many brokers also offer access to certain index mutual funds in their brokerage accounts ETFs trade directly on stock exchanges allowing anyone with a brokerage account to buy or sell shares at any point when the stock market is open for trade like mutual funds there are thousands of ETFs out there so it's important to understand what you're looking at when you're looking to buy the important metrics are also very similar to mutual funds if you want to look at your performance and your fees each ETF publishes an annual expense ratio which represents the percentage of the total fund assets that goes towards covering the cost that the ETF incurs every year smaller expense ratios mean more money staying in your pocket and the biggest and most efficient ETF providers have expense ratios for their funds that can be less than 0.1% some - ETFs are worth paying for but only because their returns beat their benchmark even when you factor in those fees if you're new to investing ETFs are a great place to start because they're widely available across brokerages and unlike some mutual funds there generally aren't account minimums associated with buying them ETFs and mutual funds allow the average investor to easily and cheaply be invested and diversified buying baskets of stocks and bonds at once rather than picking and choosing them one by one and because of that they are one of the best tools for new investors but they are not the only options most of us are used to borrowing money in some capacity whether it's mortgage on our homes or bumming a few bucks off a friend when we realize we've left our cash at home just as borrowing is a part of life for everyday people it's a practice companies and municipalities uphold as well even the federal government does it how by issuing bonds bonds come in several varieties corporate municipal and government though their nuances might differ they're all generally the same debt instruments used to raise money when an organization issues a bond it asks for a certain investment of money it then promises to pay back that investment plus interest over a specified period of time for example you might buy a 10 year $10,000 bond paying 3 percent Interest the issuer in exchange will promise to pay you interest on that $10,000 every six months and then return your $10,000 after 10 years there are two ways to make money by investing the bonds the first is to hold the bonds until their maturity date and collect interest payments on them bond interest is usually paid twice a year the second way to profit from bonds is to sell them at a price that's higher than what you pay initially for example if you buy $10,000 worth of bonds at face value meaning you paid $10,000 then sell them at $11,000 when their market value increases you can pocket the $1,000 difference stocks and ETFs are traded on public exchanges so they're fairly easy to buy and sell now bonds on the other hand aren't traded publicly but rather trade over-the-counter which means that investors must buy them from brokers the problem with the system is that because bond transactions don't occur in a centralized location investors can have a harder time knowing whether they're getting our price the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or FINRA regulates the bond market to some extent by posting transaction prices as that data becomes available but investors can sometimes experience a lag in getting that information this isn't a reason not to buy bonds but it's something to be aware of when it comes to bonds the things you want to focus on are the bond rating now this is a score of sorts that measures the financial strength of the entity issuing the bond there are three major bond rating agencies Standard & Poor's Moody's and Fitch and these agencies use a combination of letters numbers and symbols to indicate the creditworthiness of bond issuers ratings tend to follow the general grading system days are great and everything else that follows is professedly worse generally speaking the higher a bonds rating the safer it is as an investment but higher rated bonds also tend to offer lower interest rates than bonds with lower ratings and that's because investors are rewarded for taking on additional risk although bonds are generally considered a lower risk investment than stocks they are by no means risk-free all it takes is for a bond issuer to default and you as an investor will be out some money bonds generally offers stability and prick table income but they come with some disadvantages for one thing bonds require you to lock your money up for extended periods of time for example if you buy a bond with a 10-year term you're committing to keeping that money invested for 10 years and because bonds are a relatively long-term investment you'll face what's called interest rate risk when you buy them as we learned before each bond pays a certain amount of interest but what happens if you buy a 10-year bond paying 3% interest and then a month later that same issuer offers bonds at 4% suddenly your bond drops in value and if you hold it you'll lose out on potential earnings by getting stuck at that lower rate additionally bonds aren't all that conducive as long-term investments because they won't grow in the same way that's because the return on investment that you'll get with a bond is substantially lower than what you'll get with stocks consider this between 1928 and 2010 stocks averaged and 11.3% return while bonds averaged just a 5.3 percent return now imagine you're able to save three hundred dollars a month for retirement over a 30-year period if you load up on bonds an average that 5.3 percent return during that time you'll wind up with just over a 250,000 dollar nest egg but if you go with stocks instead and score an average annual eleven point three percent return on your investment you grow your retirement account to over 750,000 dollars and that's important because without that growth you'll have a hard time keeping up with inflation and maintaining your buying power when you're older we talked before about mutual funds and ETFs and how they give you access to hundreds of companies at once but what if you want to buy a specific company that's where buying individual stocks comes into the picture you can invest in individual stocks if and only if you have the time and desire to thoroughly research and evaluate stocks on an ongoing basis if this is the case we want a hundred percent encourage you to do so if not it's totally okay to stick with ETFs and mutual funds and call it a day this video is more of a broad stroke look at investing basics so we're not going to go super in-depth on how to pick individual stocks but we do have a lot of other content on the channel about that here are the important concepts you need to understand before you get started only invest in businesses you understand avoid high-risk stocks until you get the hang of investing and always avoid penny stocks start out with established growing businesses with market leading positions for example Apple and Disney are great beginner stocks they have businesses that are easy to understand Apple sells I products and has a software marketplace Disney makes movies media and owns theme parks plus they're growing profitable companies that aren't going to disappear overnight""]"

on the credit card just like you would spend any other day and fourth pay off your credit card in full at the end of every single month by the time it's due to avoid paying any interest frankly if you just paid attention to those four steps that covers about 80 percent of everything you need to know when it comes to building your credit and as long as you keep your balance completely paid off you'll get the lowest interest rates anytime you want to buy a house or leverage your money in fact most people don't realize that when it comes to buying a home having a good credit score could save you more than forty one thousand dollars just promise me that you'll be doing this if you haven't done it already it's so important and I'm sitting here on a Monday night at 9 00 PM just trying to get this point across to you and there are still people out there that'll watch these videos that don't do anything about it you know this is serious when I'm not asking you to subscribe or hit the like button or get a free stock Down Below in the description when you sign up for public.com because that could be worth all the way up to a thousand dollars trust me a good credit score goes a long long way and if you want to improve on the score you already have make sure to pay down your balances as much as possible add new credit cards into the mix and remove any negative marks in your credit report that could be bogging you down and fifth one of the biggest mistakes that almost everybody makes is not tracking your finances in fact this is so bad that 45 of Millennials have no idea how much money is in their bank account and only 24 of them are spending money in such a way that they could actually afford which is way less than I ever expected and that's got to stop first I'd immediately recommend signing up for a free budgeting software like mint.com which Aggregates all of your accounts and itemizes everything in one place second from there review all of your spending throughout the last 60 days even if you think you're perfect and you have nothing to cut back I guarantee that there are things in there that you have no idea ever existed and those are things that you could begin saving money on third speaking of saving money itemize everything into two categories the first one is your must-have non-negotiable spending and your second is the discretionary spending go ahead from all of those add them up fourth once you get that total begin cutting back in your discretionary spending that you don't absolutely need and then begin negotiating the mandatory spending to see if you could lower some of those costs trust me if you actually go and do this in a few hours you should be able to save a few hundred dollars a month without even realizing it plus if you're single it was found that the majority of women find irresponsible spending a turn off so get it together and finally six with 35 of millionaires saying that retirement is going to take a miracle don't forget to contribute to your retirement accounts as soon as possible that's because one of the biggest advantages that you have in your 20s is time not only can you write out any short-term fluctuations in the market but you could also take advantage of compound interest where the money you make makes you more money which makes you more money which makes you more money until eventually you're worth the quadrillion dollars and have a Lambo but just consider this if you invest a hundred dollars a month beginning at the age of 20 at an eight percent return by the time you're 65 you'll have five hundred and four thousand dollars invested but instead if you figured"", ""but even if you have all that money to just pay it in cash you should really never do that for reasons that i will get to in another video but as soon as you hit level 18 trust me get yourself a credit card because this side quest takes years to fully finish in order to build your credit history personally i recommend going with something like a secured credit card or this uh discover it's secured it's kind of like the gold standard if you don't have history and it's pretty cool because it gives you two percent cash back on different categories and one percent cash back on everything else but pro tip if you're a student in college instead of getting that one get yourself the cash back student edition of that card it's the same idea but it's going to give you better perks and the idea of this is to get a high score of 750 or higher and we could do all that within eight months to one year if you can follow these next few steps number one make sure to always pay your bills on time and never carry a balance because if you do you're going to pay more money in interest alone than all the rewards that you're going to get in return if you could do all that then 35 of your score will be accounted for just paying on time but if you miss your payment for whatever reason immediately pick up the phone and call the little number on the back of a credit card and ask them for forgiveness usually the first missed payment is going to be okay and it can be forgiven as long as you call and ask and number two is the utilization rate which accounts for a huge thirty percent of your score now if you can keep your utilization rate of thirty percent or lower you'll do just great for you have a thousand dollar monthly spending limit spend no more than three hundred thirty three dollars and thirty three cents but if you wanna be ultra conservative and do what i did and get there far quicker then utilize no more than ten percent or a hundred dollars or less in this case now you could literally just buy one little tiny thing like a pack of gum or just some gas and in that case your utilization rate will be in the single digits and that will improve your score dramatically and number three is your length of history which accounts for 15 of your credit score which is why it's so important to do this as early as possible now for me this is what drags my score down the most and if i had started when i was 18 my score would easily be over 800 by now but pro tip cheat code if you can have your parents co-sign on their credit cards for you then you will inherit their credit score if they have an excellent score i couldn't do this because my parents didn't have a good score but your mileage may vary if you can do these three things you will easily and quickly beat this side quest the third item on this list is something you need to get asap as soon as you hit level 18 it's probably the most important part of this video and that is a retirement account it could be traditional or a roth ira now think of these accounts like savings accounts except instead of putting your cash in here what you're putting in here is mostly stocks and the reason you want to do this is because it protects your money from taxes in the case of a traditional ira you pay no taxes today but you will pay taxes later on the money that it's grown into in the case of a roth ira you pay taxes up front but no taxes later in life when you withdraw those millions that you're ready to retire on if you have no idea which one you want to pick you can actually have both a traditional and a roth but remember you can only contribute six thousand dollars per year and you can contribute it down the middle however you want fifty fifty one year in one one year in the other doesn't really matter now if you could do this early look how much coin you can end up with assuming a growth rate of eight percent which is what you can expect from the stock market now assuming you started to max out your roth ira account at level 18 for three years only three years until level 21 when you're fully evolved into an adult you will have ended up with 781 thousand dollars which is an insane amount of money at retirement that's amazing if you had done this at 31 then you would have ended up with 287 000 at age 67 which is almost two and a half times less all because you started just 13 years later which isn't that much of a difference that's the power of time and compound interest at work so pause this video if you're 18 years or older and go and make that account because you're literally losing money right now"", ""so let's face it Americans have a lot of debt in fact we have over 14 trillion dollars worth of debt in the country now if you take away home mortgages and that still leaves us with trillions of dollars worth of student loans credit card bills personal loans auto loans the fact is we have a lot of debt that we owe to various different organizations and companies and so what I'm gonna do in this video is we're gonna break it down as simple as possible as how you can essentially implement one of the most effective debt payoff strategies and I want you to be very wary about people who are offering to help eradicate your credit card debt or to boost your credit score 200 points anybody who's who's offering that just be careful of what's in it for them in a lot of cases it's going to be taking a piece of the pie trying to get some money from you to help you and get rid of the the credit card bills that you owe so just be very careful with that when you go through this debt payoff journey but look we have over $30,000 in student loans on average when people graduate from college a lot of Millennials are flooded with debt and if you watch the previous video about how a lot of Millennials are going to struggle to get to retirement one of those reasons is because of debt and that holds people back from not only starting families from not only buying houses but it holds them back from contributing to their retirement accounts it holds people back from making life decisions for their long-term future for saving for their kids college plans because they're not able to save any money because they have so much debt so it's very essential to pay off debt as soon as possible I think a lot of us know that""]"

obliterated I mean absolutely obliterated those numbers in such a shocking manner that throw out any forward P metrics you have for the stock any forward price to sales metrics because they're completely irrelevant now at this point in time folks look at this event sales increased 78 percent on a year-over-year basis 78 gross margin increased 470 basis points to 69 remember Nvidia elf is not a a SAS business okay they sell physical products and their gross margins are 69 it is insane okay in terms of eps they easily beat uh 29 cents came in on a gap basis they reported 42 cents on a non-gap basis or adjusted uh diluted earnings per share 42 cents here I mean this is a stock QT to have a flip and Flapjack in way folks you get out of the way in regards to this one because it's a freight train coming through now that's just a start here's the deal the guidance as far as what analysts were expecting for next year for fiscal year 2024 right which is they're about to go into their fiscal year 2024."", ""well they are only worth 161 billion Nvidia jumped much more than that today you look at McDonald's market cap 200 billion dollars Nvidia jumped more than that today as well these jumps are just mind-blowing this is a market environment where there's tons and tons of capital available for any stock that is profiting off this new AI Trend or people think is going to profit off this new AI Trend here you have Nvidia literally adding market caps market caps worth of generationally successful companies in a single day so why is everyone Rush to buy the stock well because they are in the middle of this Gold Rush everyone and their mother is out to take advantage of this new AI Trend and its potential but every company that adopts any sort of AI software needs a powerful chip to power that Ai and investors have been looking head over fist and fist overhead to try to find the next stock that could benefit from this however Nvidia is one of the clearest ones and it's already showing huge proof of concept nvda said it expects 11 billion dollars of sales in the three months ending July whereas analysts thought it was only going to have 7.2 billion you were already starting to see a lot of companies panic and try to jump on this AI bandwagon and how do they do that well they do that through insane research spending in order to research and develop new platforms that are going to deliver AI while they need really really good processing power and so they need the chips and they're going to Nvidia to buy the chips this is what one analyst said quote The transformational Surge in AI spending is paying off much earlier than expected Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote in a note we simply have no historical precedent for the magnitude of this step function nvda is running right now so much because investors know that this AI craze is going to be around for quite a long time because it's going to deliver a ton a ton of value to the Future economy and to the economy of the medium and the short term for any company that can take advantage of this any company right now that decides hey I'm not going to do anything with AI is going to be looked at like a company in the 90s or early 2000s who said I'm not going to do anything with the internet and while it's hard to choose who is going to actually be the biggest winner in this it's not hard to see that you're going to need a big processor lots of processing power in order to win at this"", ""I mean they just beat revenues very nicely last quarter they obviously beat on EPS as well they put pretty low guidance out there my opinion so they could come in with a nice beat and we're looking at a company that on 2024 numbers is trading at a 2024 PE of roughly 36.37 and once again this is a company that's at the infant stage of profitability so when you're talking about a company that's at the infant stage of profitability that has among the best gross margins you'll find of any public company in the world I think I think it might be undervalued significantly and if we want to add a cherry on top in this whole situation look what Alex carp said the depth of Engagement with and demand for artificial intelligence platform is without precedent which means they just have overwhelming amount of either government clients commercial clients asking questions about their product looking in their product interest in their product and if that's the situation you're going to see massive amounts of closed deals for palantir over this next I would say 12 to 36 months and obviously once palantir gets in the door they got a pretty sticky business model there and they're likely going to keep uh you know the majority of these customers they attract those next 12 to 36 months now that everybody has to consider an AI plan for their companies""]"
27,26,73,26_bear_bear market_bears_bulls,"['bear', 'bear market', 'bears', 'bulls', 'bull market', 'bull', 'market', 'investors', 'bear markets', 'prices']","[""but I always use it as the Sheep because I think of the sheep being following the herd and so think of the sheep out there as the herd and the masses and the Sheep are going to follow the herd and as a result when people begin to take profits everyone's going to start to sell because the herd is going to follow so basically the initial investors took profits and now the herd is going to follow because they're looking to take profits because loss aversion is being triggered this is one of the psychological reasons why people sell a stock we're going to get into this later on that's going to be one of my favorite sections to cover um so at this point Panic begins to be triggered and the market is very uncertain you're seeing a very volatile Market people have concerns about the market and investor sentiment at that point is moving from a a bullish sentiment towards a bearish sentiment right now it's pretty much uncertain so if this does end up resulting in a bear Market you're going to see prices fall and fall and fall people are going to be more fearful of the market more people are going to be getting out of the market but once the market is oversold buying will eventually outpace the selling and this is going to create demand end so at that point you're going to see a little bit of greed you're going to see greed start to step in so for a while there during you know the second stage investors are very fearful everyone's getting out of the market people are saying you'd be crazy to buy but once you get to step three there or stage three that's when you're seeing investors start to say okay um there's a lot of good companies that are significantly undervalued I'm going to start investing and oftentimes it's those who took profits before the bear Market as those institutional investors those long-time investors that have been through many bear markets and bull markets they start to understand that hey these are just Cycles these are just Trends and that's when they start to scoop up these undervalued stocks and they begin to support the stock prices and then eventually the fall levels off and investors enter the market again and at that point the market gives way to a bull market this is finally the end of that bear market prices are being supported"", ""so if you start to see this zone break down let's give it a little bit of leeway let's go down to about 23 3 because there is confluence with that 34 ema as well that is that should be your line in the sand in my opinion i'm just moving that little bit up so you can see clearly if you do want to take a screenshot then feel free to do so so this is also your buy the dip zone this is your buy the dip zone around 23 000 any daily closers that happen under 23 000 would confirm that you've broken this main trend down which we came close to doing uh two days ago but you can see we wicked off of that so that was quite a scary time and consequently we're currently sort of facing the same situation so the bulls need to take charge of this very very quickly and they need to run this to the upside uh in the next couple of days probably even over this weekend if they want to continue their bullish momentum otherwise bears are going to take full control and this could get sent down and sent down quite hard that is so looking at this chart over here i just want to have a look at the emas and the momentum oscillators my main edges on the four hour chart you're again going to see that confluence coming in with the blue 200 ema which is sitting right now it's rising it's at 22 900 so again just round that up 23 000 is your main point of control 23 uh thousand to twenty three five on a four hour chart your higher low needs to be defended at twenty two eight so again for the sake of safety just round it up easy number to remember twenty three thousand is the number that you need to be focusing on and put in a price label in case someone wants to put a screenshot that's your your four-hour um higher low that needs to be defended and it should be okay momentum oscillators are coming down but if it manages to reset and and near the bottom while price gets to that level i am going to be a buyer i'm definitely buying this zone i'm buying 23 000."", ""so now we're going to talk about investor sentiment which is one of the biggest precursors to a bear or a bull market so investor or Market sentiment is the overall feeling of the market and as we will discuss later on the market is controlled by the emotions of fear and greed I know a lot of people try to over complicate the stock market they try to make it all about numbers and figures and uh the truth is guys the stock market is controlled by two things that is the fear and the greed and I want you guys to commit that to memory these go hand in hand with supply and demand which we're going to talk about in a little bit but the majority of the market is simply controlled by fear and greed now following investor confidence or fear indicated by a sell-off that will indicate a bear Market maybe on the horizon so when investors lose confidence in the market they become fearful a lot of them begin to sell off and that sell-off can really push us into a bear market now the interesting thing is that a lot of people do things because they are afraid of a bear market so something happens maybe there's something going going on in the geopolitical climate maybe there's something going on that they're worried about for example a lot of people had concerns When Donald Trump was elected president and uh so as a result if people are fearful enough and there is enough sell-off pressure um this sell-off in fear of a bear Market can actually trigger that bear market and turn those expectations into a reality so oftentimes people being afraid of a bear market and taking actions that actually causes the bear Market itself which is very interesting so there are actually a couple different stages of the bear market so here are the four stages of a bear market so number one we are at a period where prices are high there's bullish sentiments so people are expecting stock prices to go higher we're in a bull market and many investors begin to take profits so this is a point where a lot of beginner investors are getting in because that's the point when you're starting to realize that markets are a little bit high prices are a little high and when stupid money is being made when you see beginners getting into the stock market and making money um that's not to say you guys won't have luck with it""]"

a website that we're building where we're analyzed where we're creating a platform to analyze and value different stocks so far we've already built the discounted cash flow calculator but the plan is to just keep adding different ways to Value different stocks so at some point you built a punch in a ticker when you do the website will kick back what the best valuation methods are for that particular company and what the stock is worth using each different valuation method ideally we do the research we see if the stock looks like a good long-term Buy and Hold and if it is the valuation calculator can help us get there even faster now down the road after that we're going to add financial statements we're going to add the ability to analyze the companies listening to conference calls things like that we plan on going far with this and the advantage of signing up now before the website is official is that before it's while it's still in beta version the advantage of signing up now

ratio or the price to book ratio or many of the other ratios and metrics that exist out there in the stock market investing world this is going to be a video going through my top three uh simple easy to use metrics that are really useful to quickly screen out businesses that may look really cheap or really expensive just by some surface level numbers now none of these metrics really replace a full intrinsic value calculation and i have several videos on the channel on how to do that if you're interested in checking those out but these are very useful in order to screen different types of businesses some of these metrics work really well with certain types of companies and not so well with other types of companies so this video is going to be a simple how-to on how to use some of these key metrics and your own stock market investing now before we get into that we do have a sponsor for today's video and today's sponsor is hatch now i just actually checked through my email history and i've been a customer personally of hatch for coming up about two years now in about a week's time i will have been a customer of hatch for two years uh and i was paying for that service with my own money out of my own pocket from well before they were a sponsor of this channel and basically what hatch does is they allow you as a new zealander to buy shares in the us much cheaper than many of the alternatives like some of the big banks that offer overseas brokerage now uh initially when i switched across it really was just fees that uh sort of got me converted to hatch i was paying 90 us dollars a trade with one of the big banks i can now do that same trade for three us dollars in hatch but one of the things that they've also done throughout these two years is continue to improve the

working for you through investment is simply figuring out where to start we live in a world where we're overwhelmed with information on a range of different topics and the investment field really is no different over the years as I've continued to learn more and more about investing I found that one of the most effective ways to get those great investment ideas into my head is simply through Reading and I've also found that there's no secret strategy to guaranteed High returns with no risk or anything like that but there is a well-beaten path that many people have taken historically that has worked very well and is likely to continue to work well moving forward so in this video I'd like to share five pieces of recommended reading from me to you that I think really cover the basics of investing very well and would certainly suit a beginner investor or potentially someone who's a little bit further along in the journey but feels that they still have a few you kind of wicker areas that I'd like to like to work on and this definitely isn't like a definitive list of must read investment books or anything like that but this is a set of materials that has really helped me personally build a strong investment framework over the past few years one that I'm very comfortable with moving forward and one that I think will serve me well probably for the rest of my life and although I focus predominantly on stock market Investments on this YouTube channel the principles really apply to all types of investing whether it be in the stock market in real estate or even in private businesses for me I've settled on more of a Warren Buffett long-term value investing approach to growing my money over time so you will see that influence throughout this list because frankly it's really the only method that's ever made sense to me rationally for making good returns over time without taking absurd levels of risk and if a personal friend of mine was really serious about getting started with investing and becoming a better investor over time this is sort of the list of five reading materials that I would Point them towards as well so if you enjoyed this video be sure to subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and perhaps even share it with a friend who you think might be interested in getting started on their investment Journey but without further Ado let's get straight into this list of top 5 reading materials for beginner investors now the first book I have is this one invested by Phil and Danielle town now if you're not familiar with Phil town he is the author of a couple of different books uh rule one and payback time I have both of those on the bookshelf behind me and this is the third book that Phil town has written this one is a little different because he actually wrote it with his daughter Danielle Danielle actually started her career as a lawyer working huge 80 100 hour plus weeks I got exceptionally burnt out and decided that she really needed to find a different path to kind of move forward in life and that was actually the emphasis for Phil and Danielle to start a podcast together where you would have Danielle who really knew absolutely nothing about investing and Phil Town who had been investing successfully for decades and had taught thousands and thousands of people over the years the basics of investing and I'm an avid listener of that podcast still to this day it's called invested they put out episodes every week and this book really summarizes the journey for Danielle and some of the key lessons that she'd learned along the way and it's written in very plain and simple language that's easy for really anyone to understand and I think it's a really nice place to start for absolute brand new beginner investors now like I mentioned I have also read Phil Town's other books rule one and payback time I think they're good but the lessons from those two books really are summarized and invested and invested also adds a little bit of new stuff on top""]"

become ever more difficult as time goes on and i suspect they'll start with the things that tend to be the most expensive purchases for the average person at the top of this list we have housing whose costs have been going through the roof in most countries as i mentioned in our recent video about the housing market the rising costs in this corner of the economy will eventually cause the population to push politicians to do something as we've seen in countries like germany one of the outcomes could be that the government starts nationalizing housing i.e taking it away from landlords in the name of the greater good and while these policies will be directed towards the big fish at first the small fish will come next just like with taxation alternatively if the housing market collapses we could see asset managers like blackstone swoop in and acquire as many properties as possible with the freshly printed money they received from their respective central banks basically your rent from the government or from wall street the next item on the list is automobiles of all kinds and this is where lots of work is already being done by car sharing companies like car to share shared electric scooter companies like lime and shared bicycle companies like mobike you can bet your bottom dollar that these entities are extracting as much data as they can in preparation for hardware as a service models for similar automobiles and the fact that many of these companies continue to receive large investments despite being barely profitable is evidence to this effect on that note hardware as a service in automobiles is likely part of why there's such a huge push for electric vehicles that's because it's easy to break the rules of a sharing economy when the vehicle is powered by petrol and hardware but it's much harder to break the rules when the vehicle is powered by electricity and software moreover there's a limit to how many electric cars can be made because there doesn't seem to be enough lithium on the planet to replace existing cars with electric cars according to the world economic forum's own research this effectively guarantees that electric cars will need to be shared now phones and computers will probably be the third class of products to get sucked into the hardware as a service scheme but i suspect it will take quite some time for the average person to be okay with this that's because phones and computers are frequently listed as a person's most valuable possessions primarily because it's something that you can truly shape according to your liking these devices also contain lots of sensitive personal data that you'd rather keep to yourself and not share with anyone keeping track of phones and computers would also be very difficult without a digital id which is also a prerequisite for the rollout of central bank digital currencies and internet censorship which the powers that b have explicitly stated they want to see the worst part of all this is that there are increasing numbers of people who are unironically on board with this hardware as a service idea this is simply because an increasing number of people can't afford a home a car or even a nice computer or phone"", ""Los Angeles residents will be subject to an additional four to five and a half percent tax on all properties sold over 5 million dollars and this is expected to completely destroy the high-end property Market throughout the entire State potentially resulting in even more people leaving so here's the deal most dates of what's known as a transfer tax usually paid by the seller anytime a property changes ownership in Los Angeles the transfer tax was about 0.45 of the sales price with money usually going back into the county but that was until of course measure Ula went into effect this is a new plan that was established to fund affordable housing and provide resources for the homeless by enacting a four to five and a half percent tax on the sales price of every property sold over five million and the long-term effects of this are said to be disastrous of course for those unaware is a bit of a background homelessness is a serious issue throughout California which is occupied by more than half of all unsheltered people in the country in fact California spent 10 billion dollars between 2018 and 2021 trying to solve the issue but the number of those living on the streets continued to rise despite California soon becoming the fourth largest economy in the world in this case though a four to five and a half percent transfer tax is expected to raise 672 million dollars for affordable housing and it's not just applicable to Los Angeles the problem though comes with the fact that California's one percent currently pay more than half of the State's income tax and as of lately a lot of them are leaving and that's a huge problem the CEO of the California taxpayer Association even said that the top five percent of income earners pay 70 percent of the personal income tax so if even a few of those taxpayer is rethink California as a place to live that does have an impact in the state budget in terms of the housing market though even though people hear Mansion tax and assume that it only applies to A-list actors athletes and hedge fund managers in reality it's mainly going to affect the construction of multi-family and commercial buildings because of five percent tax and the entire amount can often equate to more than half of a builder's overall profit margin this means that there's even less incentive now for investors to add more housing Supply into the market businesses will be less inclined to expand and this only gives more of a reason for people to leave on top of that it said that the new tax would apply to the entirety of the sale consideration not solely the amount in excess of the five or ten million dollar thresholds and regardless of whether the property is sold at a gain or a loss this means that a property that sells for four million 999 999 dollars will not have to pay the additional tax while a property that sells for one dollar more will have to pay a 225 thousand dollar fee it just makes no sense personally I think this measure affects the entirety of California because even though this currently only applies to the largest cities the expectation is that the dollar amount could very well be lowered and there's nothing stopping them from applying this throughout the entire State on top of that to me there's really no logic in applying the tax to the entire amount it would be no different than the IRS saying if you make more than forty four thousand seven hundred and twenty six dollars all of your income will be taxed at 22 percent no tax system works like that and generally it's only the tax above that amount that applies not the whole amount I see this unfortunately as a misguided attempt to solve a problem by simply throwing more money at it versus solving the core issue which in my opinion is a former resident of California is simply a lack of accountability throughout all Statewide spending kind of like spending a hundred billion dollars on a high-speed rail that went nowhere If instead California spent more money prioritizing mental health or addiction I think they go lot further than raising taxes on people who are more likely to leave but speaking of that there is another topic that's most likely going to have a direct impact on you and that's what brings us to a brand new proposal to raise taxes let me explain as it stands right now the United States is quickly running out of money with the national debt approaching 32 trillion dollars now typically this isn't much of a concern when interest rates are low and you could pretty much borrow as much money as you wanted to for free but now with rapidly Rising rates the United States is beginning to pay a lot more in interest roughly a trillion dollars a year to be exact and that's a problem especially when costs are only expected to go higher so as a way to pay for the national debt a new proposal would cut the deficit by three trillion dollars over the next 10 years and most likely it's going to have an effect on you in one way or another first this would increase the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 raising 1.3 trillion dollars as they say this would still be lower than the 35 tax that was established before the 2 2017 tax cuts and jobs act but it would ensure that companies pay their fair share at a slightly higher tax rate than what we're currently seeing in terms of the potential repercussions of this a tax Foundation analysis found that a 28 corporate tax rate would reduce GDP by 0.7 percent or 160 billion dollars stocks and wages would marginally decline and 138 000 full-time jobs be lost thankfully they believe the loss would be gradual but it could result in a GDP decline of 720 billion dollars over the next 10 years which is larger than the tax revenue that would be generated in its place as a result they believe that long-term higher corporate tax would result in incomes dropping by one and a half to two percent so overall as far as I think about all of this 28 tax is probably not the most effective at generating Revenue"", ""and it's already causing the cost of gas per gallon to go up 15 cents from the month before now the real bad news though is the price of rent a whole bunch of people a wave of people who may have bought a house are now forced to keep renting because of all the pressure on the market right now those renters don't have a lot of options and they do have more tensions with their landlords many say the rent is too damn high and experts say it's in part due to the high cost of buying a home rent is becoming a huge problem for a couple reasons the latest data from Redfin shows even though the median home sale price is down 2.1 percent this year in comparison to last year housing payments are actually up in insanely High almost 15 percent combine all of that with the still low inventory levels and the tighter lending standards and that just means that people need higher credit scores higher down payments and higher incomes and that means people are forced to go back to renting only to then find out that rent is becoming that much more expensive nationally rent is more than 20 percent higher than the start of 2020 according to Redfin over 8 million Americans are behind on rent and 2.3 million experienced a rent increase of more than 500 in the last 12 months according to U.S census data released late last month the typical application fee is now anywhere from twenty to a hundred dollars just to apply for rent according to Redfin now it's not all that data here's one major reason why real estate is becoming more unaffordable that's a lot less talked about private Equity firms private Equity firms raise money from institutional and accredited investors so not just from any ordinary person those funds are then invested in different types of assets with the aim of getting a return on investment according to Americans for financial reform 1.6 million families rented from Real Estate owned by private Equity firms that includes over one million apartment units over 275 000 home lots and nearly two hundred and forty thousand single-family rental homes so there's no doubt that people are forced to compete with private equity in some markets and that's not helping homes become affordable but besides residential real estate there's also a massive problem with commercial real estate FDIC insured Bank hold the largest share of cre mortgages at 39 or 1.7 trillion dollars thirteen percent is held in cmbs and most is held at Regional and Community Banks now this year and next there is a huge pipeline of commercial mortgages hitting maturity that need to be refinanced refinancing those spaces will be really hard because interest rates have doubled over the last two years which will make those loans so much more expensive now I've talked about this problem in my last video but the problem is getting worse small Banks were actually the largest holders of retail spaces at 46 percent and 30 percent of office spaces property owners who need to refi are up against higher borrowing costs and lower property values Mark Grant Chief Global strategist at Collier security says everybody's scaling back their risk appetite for real estate loans office owners in particular are getting squeezed 40 billion dollars worth of these properties are now seen in distress but now those smaller banks are under pressure thanks to the banking crisis and the vacancies are going up and that's mostly happening because after the pandemic people chose to do hybrid work or work from home and now there's less of a need for businesses to own those commercial buildings in the first place and that's why the amount of office space for lease has been going up and it's estimated that by the end of the decade the majority of office spaces will be vacant prices are estimated to Fall by as much as 40 percent in commercial real estate if things continue the way they are right now now because Banks understand everything I just shared with you in this video Banks tend to become protective and defensive in this type of an economy and that's why the next big worry is something called a credit crunch events in the banking system over the past two weeks are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses which would in turn affect economic outcomes a credit crunch happens when Banks stop lending as much money as they used to and this makes it harder for people to get a loan to buy a home and it makes it harder for businesses to operate and pay their employees and this is happening today small business bankruptcies are on the rise and we're seeing more today than we did at the height of the pandemic and the unique data that we have from UBS evidence lab suggests that these filings are up to a rate of about eight per week I think that the underlying message is that there is weakness in the SME sector the SME sector by the way refers to small and mid-sized Enterprises and it's companies that usually have less than 500 employees and make less than 100 million dollars in annual gross sales per year now these types of businesses according to the World Bank organization make up over 90 percent of the economy and over 50 percent of the workforce around the world now for the US in 2020 these companies made up 99 of the US economy and 47.1 percent of the U.S Workforce these types of companies are the lifeblood of the economy and a credit crunch would severely hurt them because they also have what's called floating rate debt which means any time they have to refinance their loans if interest rates are higher that puts a huge amount of pressure on them and it makes it that much more expensive and because people have pulled their money out of the smaller Regional banks that also means those banks have less liquidity to then lend that money out this makes those Banks more conservative and more defensive which leads to even less lending which eventually slows economic growth which translates to higher unemployment and we're already starting to see that happen outside of just the tech sector now of course this is a crisis that we should take seriously but it's also something that may never happen and this is because the government could step in and allow those companies to make interest-only payments on their loans and believe it or not this is already a thing in residential real estate you can apply for a mortgage interest only payment and your monthly payments for your house are going to be a lot lower but the trade-off is you're never gonna own the house some people call that renting but the banks call it you'll own nothing and be happy now since I'm an optimist I tend to believe that Banks don't want to repossess the commercial property because they don't want the liability they don't want to lose the money and the government doesn't want small businesses to go into a depression so more than likely the FED will have to step in and do something about all this and that brings us to interest rates now no one knows exactly what will happen to those interest rates because we don't live inside the mind of Jerome Powell but the stock market makes its own prediction every single day on what it thinks will happen on May 3rd that's the next time we'll hear about what happens to interest rates now there's actually two ways you can check yourself right now on what might happen and the first is my favorite method and it's called the CME fed watch tool the way to read this chart is to look at the current Target rate which is 4.75 to 5 now on the left you'll see a probability right now it shows 34.1 percent that the target rate on stay the exact same as it is right now on the right though it shows us a 65.9 percent chance that the FED will raise the target rate to between 5 and 5.25 percent which is a difference of a quarter percent from the current rate so that's the tool I use to tell you that come May 3rd most likely the Federal Reserve will increase the interest rates by 0.25 percent and hopefully that'll be the ceiling but we'll see that's all the short-term way to tell now the long-term way to tell is a little less reliable""]"

first 100 000 is extremely difficult likely much harder than working a normal 9 to 5 job and that is why so many people end up quitting the pursuit the thing with entrepreneurship is that it revolves heavily around a compound growth curve this is what the typical income graph looks like for someone with a good job we have single digit raises most years but overall it's pretty flat over the first few years you'll likely make more money than your peers trying to start their own businesses now let's layer on the income of a pretty typical entrepreneur obviously some major differences at first glance right most entrepreneurs will make very little at the start because the first 100 000 is so incredibly hard you're learning you're trying new things failing doing a lot of work but not getting paid and as a result you'll probably make less money that's exactly what happened to me i did not make good money coming out of college because i did not have a nine-to-five job instead i pursued side hustles and started businesses and i actually lost money on a lot of my ventures but like all challenging things at some point you'll get through that initial trek through mud and cow turds and stumble across a scene much nicer which is basically unlimited income potential on your schedule stick through those initial years and you'll hit that inflection point where your income surpasses that of your friends continues rising and then eventually reaches the moon here's a clip from elon musk on what it was like in his first years as an entrepreneur sleeping in an office and showering at the ymca when my brother and i were starting our first company instead of getting an apartment we just rented us a small office and we slept on the couch and we we showered at the the ymca and uh we're so hot up"", ""but if you do your chances of success are actually going to Skyrocket also you might wonder why should you care about my opinion on this topic the answer is quite simple I am part of the illustrious one percent I have made millions of dollars as a cryptocurrency investor and as a successful entrepreneur in the cryptocurrency space so let's dive in and get with number one this journey is not going to be a walk in the park I understand the Allure of painting a picture where everybody effortlessly wins and becomes rich we're all gonna make it right but let's be real here not everyone makes in fact most people don't it's far from the truth to say that they will investing in groundbreaking Technologies whether it's cryptocurrencies Cutting Edge AI stocks we're buying products medicine whatever it's a tough damn game the odds of failure are super high and we have to acknowledge that and be very aware of those kind of risks now if you're committed to playing this game then you have to dedicate yourself to actually mastering this game because it's very high reward game but it does require the work to be put in sure there are other avenues to make money running business doing Drop Shipping something like that and the lessons that we're talking about here definitely can be applicable there as well but let me tell you for investors the opportunities that we have before us right now I think have probably never been more promising could be some of the next decade if we want the best decades in investing history from wealth generation whether it's in AI or whatever else and yes of course crypto the coming years are going to be colossal now that means that you need to level up your skills right now yesterday second best times now it's time to start learning about trading to grasp the power of on-chain analysis tools to harness the potential of artificial intelligence technology and how you can use that in your research or to make content whatever it might be most people remain trapped in their comfort zones never daring to venture out beyond that zone but not you you're different you're hungry for Success you're willing to push yourself Beyond those limitations and grasp the success that you know you deserve number two make making money your obsession there's something you need to remember the top one percent of earners they work on average 46 hours a week right they get the same amount of seconds in a day right the bottom one percent of earners they work around 43 hours a week now the difference in total effort is small only three hours a week but the dramatic income difference is insane we're talking about the difference between broke ass barely able to feed your kids to ultra Rich Lifestyles now once you realize that it is a choice on how you spend your time in the things that you dedicate your working life towards then you can actually make the choice to making it your obsession to cracking the code of making money me figure out what others have done to make it big here's the crazy part lots of people have done it before and they've left breadcrumbs all over the place you know what kind of Investments did they make what did they do that you can personally replicate the secrets to making money are actually not so secret this is the great thing about the modern internet era lots of people walk down that path and lots of those people who have walked down that path have left guides they do podcasts they write books they post on Twitter all the time all this stuff is there for you for free to get now once you allow that Obsession for learning these secrets into your life then you will have exited from the paycheck to paycheck Matrix that the vast majority of people are stuck in and you will be on your path to

34,33,61,33_option_options_strike_18,"['option', 'options', 'strike', '18', 'share', 'contract', 'price', 'trader', 'stock', 'cents share']","[""[Music] hello and welcome this is the first video in a short series that explains covered calls if needed before watching this video you may want to watch the first video in my basic option series titled what is the stock option a covered call as a combination of two positions the first is a long position on a stock or ETF the second is a short position on a call option when one buys a call option they are locking in a preset buy price for an asset when one sells or shorts a call option they are selling their commitment to later sell an asset for a preset sell price therefore placing a covered call means that the trader is buying a stock or ETF and then selling an option contract that locks in the right for the option buyer to buy that stock or ETF from the trader for a preset price let's look at a hypothetical example to explain let's say stock XYZ is currently trading for $10 to share to place a covered call the trader buys a hundred shares of the stock for $10 a share he also sells a call option contract with an $11 strike price that expires in a month he is paid twenty five cents that share upfront for selling the option the trader has bought XYZ for $10 a share he has also sold the right for someone else to buy XYZ from him for $11 to share and he was paid 25 cents a share for that right if the price of XYZ is above eleven dollars a share when the call option he sold expires the traders obligated to sell his shares of XYZ for $11 a share he bought XYZ for $10 a share and he sells it for 11 so he makes $1 a share on the stock plus he was paid 25 cents a share selling the option so his total profit is a dollar 25 a share if the price of XYZ does not rise above 11 dollars a share before the option the traders sold expires the option expires worthless this means that the trader keeps his stock plus he keeps the 25 cents that he was paid upfront for selling the option as profit the next month he sells another option and the process repeats the risk for a covered called trader is that the price of the underlying stock makes a large move downward the premium that the covered called trader collapsed somewhat helps protect the trader against a downward movement of the underlying stock when placing a covered call a trader must choose which stock or ETF to buy and which option to sell on that stock or ETF there is a trade-off between potential profit versus downside risk for each option the trader could sell the trader must consider the cost of the option in other words the amount he would collect upfront the price at which the option is exercised in other words the option strike price the amount of downside protection that the option provides and the break-even point therefore the selection of which stock or ETF to use for covered calls and which call option to sell on that stock or ETF depends on the strategy and goals of the trader in the next video we will look at examples of covered calls I hope that you enjoyed this video thanks for watching you"", ""hello and welcome in this video I show an example of selling a put option to buy stock for this example I will use sov the silver ETF at the time of making this video sov is currently trading at eighteen dollars and sixty two cents per share let's say that a trader wants to buy a thousand shares of sov to hold long term however this trader only wants to buy sov if the price of sov drops to $18 per share which is the price that he feels is a good price to buy and hold at one choice would be for the trader to place a limit order for $18 and leave it open if SLV drops to $18 below the order is executed and the trader buys the thousand shares for $18 a share as he wanted to do another choice would be for the trader to sell ten $18 put options that expire in one month by doing so he is agreeing to buy a thousand shares of sov from the buyer of the options for $18 per share if sov should drop to $18 or below the buyer of the option space it upfront cost to buy the options called a premium in this case the premium is 33 cents a share of $330 total for premium varies from stock to stock depending mostly on the stops volatility now let's compare the two choices trader a places an open limit order to buy a thousand shares of sov for $18 and trade of B sells 10 $18 put options on sov let's say SLV does not drop to $18 a below over the next month trader a sits there with his open $18 limit order and nothing happens however trader B sold 10 $18 put options and was paid $330 to do this because sov does not drop to $18 below the put options expire worthless and unused so trader be simply Kisa $330 for trader a nothing has happened the entire month except that he had to leave 18,000 dollars sitting unused in his account waiting for the price of SLV to drop for Trader be things are a bit different he sold 10 $18 put options and was paid $330 to do it he also has $18,000 sitting in an account as well but he has made $330 worth it which is almost a two percent return in a month on his $18,000 his money is also sitting unused waiting to buy the same stock trader a is waiting to buy however he has made a 2% return in a month on that $18,000 let's say instead that sov drops to 1775 a share the limit order for trader a is executed and he buys a thousand shares of sov for $18 to share the put options for trader B are executed and he is assigned a thousand shares of sov for $18 a share which is a fancy way of saying that he buys a thousand shares of sov for $18 a share from the guy he sold the options to now let's compare it is important to note here that I'm leaving off commissions for simplicity trader a less $18,000 sit in an account then bought the stop for $18,000 with the current price of 1775 per share he is down $250 traitor be sold 10 put options and was paid in this example a total of $330 for this he also bought the stock for $18 a share but he was paid a total of 33 cents a share upfront so his total net cost is 1767 per share he is up 80 dollars while trader a is down 250 remember that both traders wanted to buy and hold the stock for $18 per share and both traders did that if the stock had never gone below 18 dollars a share trader B keeps selling put options each month making money while trader aids money just sits in his account unused let's say that sov drops way down in price both traders were gonna buy SL via $18"", ""but he had locked in the right to sell sov for $18 per share he sells SLV for 18 and he paid a total of 17 dollars and 33 cents per share so he makes 67 cents a share - brokerage commissions the trader paid 33 cents per share to lock in a sell price of $18 per share therefore for the trader to make money the price of sov must be lower than 17 dollars and 67 cents per share in other words sov must drop at least 33 cents per share below the locked-in sell price of $18 to pay for the 33 cents per share cost of the option locking in a sell price of $18 per share for a cost of 33 cents per share means that sov must drop to 1767 per share or below if sov does not drop below 1767 a share the trader loses money if sov stays at or above $18 a share the trader would not choose to use this option to sell the stock at $18 per share since you can get more for selling it at the current price at the time of more than $18 per share therefore the option expires worthless and the trader loses to 33 cents he paid up front if sov drops below $18 per share but not below 1767 per share the trader does use his option he buys sov at the current price of between 1767 and 18 and sells it for 18 making the difference between the two however the amount he makes is less than the 33 cents upfront cost he paid so he loses some money but not the whole 33 cents to share he would lose if sov was at $18 or higher now let's compare shoulding a stock versus buying a put option shorting a stock requires more capital upfront buying the $18 put option only cost a trader $33 upfront if the trader shorts the stock and the stock rises in price his losses are potentially unlimited as the stock can climb to any price but by buying a put option instead his possible losses are capped to a maximum fixed amount of 33 cents per share or $33 total plus commissions even if the trader shorts sov and uses a stop loss to protect his account to a maximum loss the price of SLV could gap overnight or over the weekend causing him to lose more than anticipated the possible losses on buying an SL V put option is cap to a fixed amount if sov does drop in price the potential percent gain is much greater with an option let's say that sov drops is $17 per share the profit on an option trade is a much larger percentage of the required money up front there are two trade offs here the first is that sov must move a certain amount for the option to become profitable so sov could drop in price only a little bit causing the traitor that shorted sov to be profitable but not enough that the put option is profitable the other trade-off is the time factor whereas the trader that bought the put option has a much larger potential gain and a capped maximum loss his contract has a one month time limit in this example the trader chose an $18 put option on sov when the current price of sov was $18 and 62 cents a share this was not his only choice of contracts to buy in the next video we will look at other contract choices to trade or could choose with emphasis on the relationship between the upfront cost of the options also known as a premium the preset sell price that is locked in also known as the options strike price the potential gain the potential loss and where the price of sov has to be in each situation for the trader to be profitable""]"

crypto market right now which have had massive news recently that could actually really been catalysts for either the individual coins themselves or potentially even kick off much bigger narratives and catalysts within the cryptocurrency market in this video I want to talk about those eight altcoins everything from the big boys right like ethereum and cardano to defy Mainstays like curve as well as two coins that could be getting a lot of attention in about two weeks time when Apple launches its big fancy new VR headset so make sure to watch the video whole way through to hear about those coins also we're talking about altcoins here so all the usual disclaimer's a prize all coins are risky you can lose all of your money investing in all coins I own CRV and Moonbeam and ethereum which we'll be talking about in this video I do not own the other coins full disclosures as always statement Down Below in the description you can go and read that if you want also I'm not saying to run out and to buy these damn coins I'm just covering the big news from Big altcoins that I think is newsworthy and worth paying attention to and could create new narratives within the cryptocurrency market so all that being said let's start by talking about the big boy ethereum stake rates for ethereum have exploded in recent weeks in fact ethereum staking right now the rates actually hit 8.6 crazy man that's crazy now that kind of yield that sends up a big big signal in the sky it's going to draw a lot of money into into ethereum plus there are some major factors happening in the background for a theory is making me like super bullish on ethereum right now there's 20.5 million ethereum staking that's nuts man the cue to get in is weeks long people are rushing to get in very few people are leaving the little bit of ethereum that is leaving the staking contract is basically only forced exits like Kraken had to leave because their deal with the SEC Celsius got theirs out because of bankruptcy plus hundreds of thousands of ethereum have been removed from the total supply of course thanks to the burning of fees"", ""and I'll give you the brief what you need to know keep it short and snappy I wouldn't expect very detailed coin reviews from this channel there are plenty of people that do it and do it well so basic essential token very solid coin very disappointing coin action request network not in the same league as the previous points discussed at all much lower market caps of volatility can be much higher much greater risk both of loss and of gains solid white paper roadmap token burning I'll take a little bit of a quote from their white paper about the token burning so the tokens are necessary to participate in the network create advance request rewards various ts will help build the request ecosystem when using the network participants will pay a network fee payable in rec request network tokens and the network fee will be burned the idea is that after time supply will dwindle and price action will go up very decent project in my mind but be careful do your own due diligence this is a much more volatile coin than the previous ones we've discussed market cap is just nowhere near as high this is a train station in London I've been here I know where this is and that is pretty cool kripp don't even be cryptic genius there's Bitcoin cash on the the logo even so did you guys enjoy the box mining collab I certainly did I had a lot of light a lot of fun do we know thank you to Michael for setting it all up I had no idea what I was doing we took care of everything it was a great honor to do it with him for him to be my first was like crazy would you like to see me collab with someone else would you let me know who you'd like me to collab with"", ""like it's a great way to support the channel and again if you enjoy this kind of content but the big thing I also want to emphasize as well for those of you out there who are into the altcoin space and have seen some of the upward moves in Bitcoin are thinking hey is it time to go along with all coins I gotta be honest with you guys again even if this is the bottom of the bear market for Bitcoin right again the big thing that I want to emphasize is that we have not seen what is likely the lows in all coins because the low and all coins at least in terms of dominance not in dollar terms right because you want to be positioned in the place they're going to perform best right if you are going to be DCA or Trading long on any crypto place I would recommend it being Bitcoin for now and rather focusing on all coins in the coming future as we get towards better valuation ranges when dominance for Bitcoin ethereum usdt in usdc are a bit higher but now is the time to start doing the research on those plays getting involved and not only some free ways to be able to get exposure whether it be air drops or being able to participate within these projects and get some kind of rewards for it but also as well looking for the projects that you're going to want to buy or get exposure to when the time comes when the momentum is there when discounted valuations are really starting to highlight themselves and one of those plays that I'm really excited about is Creek Stevia now you guys have probably heard me talk about Greek cevia over the past two weeks you see me as a project we've actually talked about nearly almost a year ago back in early 2022 it's one of the projects on our radar but one of the play to earn or play-fi games within the cryptocurrency space that is one of the leading MMORPG games that's actually developing that's actually continuing to grow its community and has launched its really long-awaited beta here there was over 500 people playing the game during this period of time it was really awesome to see see the beta come alive for Creek Stevia and really again a big hats off to the team from the progress they've made in deploying this launch I know it's never easy there's of course some things along the way some challenges some bugs and fixes that'll come but what's really great about it is there's a lot of people simultaneously playing on the network there was more boss fights more features a lot of long-awaited things the team's been waiting to release so again a big hats off to the team on that if you guys are eager to see me play Greek cevia in the coming days to the next week we're planning to do a twitch event likely this upcoming Friday there will be some more details shared on the Twitter page so if you haven't already definitely follow them at creekscibia on Twitter you'll be able to also hit the Bell icon make sure you guys catch some great updates on the game as well as when they make the announcement for the

two assets are driven by completely different fundamental factors that constitutes diversification on the screen right now as an example u.s stocks versus international stocks they're going to be driven by different factors related to different monetary policies and what's going on in those respective economies and that uh scale also reflects the benefit diversification that that dalio seeks to to achieve uh and that you know once you get to like 15 uh different assets you can really reduce the uh the volatility the risk without necessarily reducing return this chart also illustrates that concept you know you take risky acid one for instance us stocks there's gasket two international stocks or stocks outside the u.s portfolio of both allows you to smooth things out you're not really compromising on return but the volatility of that portfolio is has potential to be reduced need to accept being wrong that's uh really important dahlia's method uh embracing mistakes learning from them is a big part of the culture that's been uh that he tries to implement at bridgewater traders go through pain like you said uh you know successful traders experience horrendous losses uh you know often before they can get to that point of of being very successful it's a common theme with many traders that's about it any questions anything you want to share join us over at informedtrades.com best of luck in your trading"", ""so portfolio concentration versus diversification how much to have in your best idea versus your second best idea and third best idea should you have money in cash how do we look at uh this sort of equation in general should we just throw that all away in terms of trying to figure out individual stocks and should we just diversify across an index um it's a really interesting topic and it's one that we actually covered on the punch card investing youtube channel on a live stream a few weeks back and it was really interesting to see where the five of us sort of agreed and where the five of us sort of differed somewhat as well i think there were a few sort of core underlying themes where we were all pretty much in agreement i don't want to put words in any of those other guys mouths or speak for them in this video but um there were some cool areas where i think we mostly agreed and there were some areas where we actually differed as well and i think a lot of it has to do with your own sort of personal goals in terms of investing your own kind of risk tolerance and and ability to maybe stomach a bit of volatility as well because if you're just putting a lot of your net worth into one or two stocks your portfolio returns are going to be very very volatile uh whereas if you are more diversified you're probably going to be a little less volatile but even that said stocks in general and stock market in general can move around a fair bit so even if you are quite diversified uh you still need to have the appropriate level of stomach to to be able to handle that as well so this is basically my own personal framework now anytime i'm looking at sizing a position in my portfolio"", ""it makes it much more difficult to to get to this land of hundred beggars if you are paying those really high multiples upfront so certainly one to watch out for you can buy really really high quality businesses and I've spoken about this a lot you can buy really high quality businesses that will grow a lot over time and still have them be quite poor investments and there's a sub point that comes in behind this one which is combining points two and three so having that growth and having that multiple expansion or the p/e ratio being pretty modest upfront and growing over time can sort of put that afterburners on what we're talking about here with with multiplying your money in these individual companies so point number four and criteria number four to find a company that has a potential to be a hundred bagger is it must have an economic moat this is something that protects it from competition number one but number two in terms of growing the business is it allows you to get that good growth that I was talking about earlier so you can grow the company and still keep healthy margins so look at a company like Apple or like Chipotle Mexican Grill they can both grow their businesses with relatively modest competition they've been able to maintain high returns on equity high returns on invested capital and keep really good margins if not expanding margins over time so that's what we look for if we compare that company to something like a business in the auto industry and the car industry or in the grocery industry there is not a lot of motor protection for many of those businesses some of them have brands some of them are the low-cost producer but there's a lot of competition that drives down the ability for those companies first off to grow and second off the ability for those companies to grow and still have good margins and not have to just fight tooth and nail to keep the business afloat with all the competition that's in that industry number five again is a relatively obvious one and this is that we prefer smaller companies when looking for hundred beggars and this is simply the law of large numbers so if we buy Apple today as an example Apple is trading for roughly a trillion dollars if we want there to be a hundred bagger the market cap of Apple is going to have to go to 100 trillion dollars now that's not strictly correct Apple can buy back a lot of stock if they buy back 50% of this years then it only has to go from one trillion to 50 trillion in terms of you getting your hundred bagger because you now own twice the percentage and the share price should go up a hundred times what the market cap only going up 50 times so that's caveat to what I just said""]"
37,36,57,36_currency_countries_dollar_china,"['currency', 'countries', 'dollar', 'china', 'gold', 'global', 'russia', 'world', 'reserve', 'nations']","[""hi folks dave waring here again with informed trades calm and the next video in a series on trading the economic crisis by summit patel in our last video cimmyt gave us a good overview of the inflation versus deflation argument in today's video we begin a new section of this series where simha is going to explore several markets where traders can express their inflation or deflation bias starting with today's video on gold so let's get started okay to understand why gold is a is a way to protect yourself in the events of an economic crisis particularly a currency crisis we sort of need we can start by by looking at economic history and how economies first of all and before there was paper money and coins that people use to trade and shop and make purchases or manage manage their wealth people bartered so for instance if I made coffee beans and you made a cotton you know we may be able to do a trade if I want a continent you wanted coffee beans of course the the problem with barter economies is that there needs to be a mutual advantage so in the example I gave you know we could only do a cotton for coffee trade if you wanted the coffee beans that I was making and if I wanted the cotton that you were produced so what naturally arose in barter economies is that the the thing or the commodity that was easiest to trade would become money so for instance let's say I had coffee beans when you were making cotton but let's say you didn't really want coffee beans uh what you you may still accept it you may still accept the coffee things that I was offering in exchange for cotton if you thought you could take those coffee beans and easily trade them for something else that you did one and if you look on the screen now there's there's a picture of cigarettes vodka and beads you know trinkets and those are all examples of currencies that have arisen in barter economies back then in many prisons now where they don't really have money but people still feel a desire to trade or can i exchange favors and things like that cigarettes are still used as as form of currency and they leaving me accepted by people who aren't smokers because the non-smokers will take them knowing that they can trade them for or something else if everyone in the currency crisis in Russia in the late 90s they saw vodka bottles of vodka become my currency if you would trade that things they won now throughout time barter economies have repeatedly chosen gold as the current that is original gold is sort of the natural currency that has that has arisen out of barter economies and this is something that's been true throughout the world and throughout history many other commodities have been tried and gold has sort of always been chosen so it has a sort of rich history and sort of there's a psychological attachment as well to cold that's been the the monetary commodity of choice for so long in terms of why the market chose gold repeatedly it's because gold has some attributes that make it really perfect or ideal for being for being a form of money one is that it's pretty portable easy to take around the other one that's storable it does not deteriorate over time which makes it conducive to saving and accruing wealth and making investments and credit and allowing an economy to grow easy to count which makes it just very simple for doing we're doing transactions easy to divide which sort of goes along with being easy to count you can do small transaction as well as larger transactions with it naturally scarce which is a key a key element and something that we're always reminded of when when the currency is being significantly devalued as you know the one of the principal reasons the currency is going to be significantly the valued is when it's been there's too much of it too much money has been created with gold that doesn't really happen because it's naturally scarce so that's one of its most one of the most important attributes and hard to counterfeit which all sort of ties into being naturally scarce you know it's hard to counterfeit and that sort of keeps its supply limited as well as keeping the economy more on and sort of tying into how goal has been with us for so long are sort of the first currents that arose even the US dollar was once pegged to gold you know prior to the Great Depression you know the the price of twenty dollars was always convertible for an ounce of gold so if you had twenty dollars you knew that you can get an ounce gold for it and that sort of instituted some monetary discipline in the sense that the government always need to make sure that they could not they can honor that that exchange that if someone to cash in their twenty dollars for an ounce gold they could do so after the great depression is repriced to thirty-five dollars an ounce and then in nineteen seventy one the gold sin who was fully abolished and there was no peg on the screen now you can see a hundred dollar gold certificate which I was a circulation in the early part of the twentieth century which shows that that a hundred dollars in gold shows the sort of gold was money here in the United States not that long ago so really that monetary history of gold mega money is something that really is been with us for a while and it's not as as archaic as many would think and even still you know when we now that we know how much of a history gold has even still now when there's problems with with the paper currencies fiat currencies that the government's issue the market still naturally tends to gravitate towards gold as sort of a way they can hedge themselves against currency risk knowing that in a worst-case scenario they could always trade gold coins if they absolutely needed to that's it's obviously not preferable but it is a sort of an option and is an insurance policy of sorts so even as this current crisis the United States is unfolded we've seen central banks increase their gold the gold positions"", ""No in fact a lot of stars need to align for this to happen but really a lot of it's about the decline of the US dollar over time and of course really of all Fiat currencies is going to be a major driving factor in seeing that go price go up and one world leader in particular he has had enough of the US dollar and that is of course Vladimir Putin he's been doing his best to build the yellow brick road toward a new Reserve currency created by a group of country called brics earlier this year he announced that Brazil Russia India China and South Africa the brics group are working on a new basket-based Reserve currency there's also interest from other countries who are also wanting to de-dollarize countries like Egypt turkey Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia one of the big wild cards here all wanting to join the brics group the issue of creating an international Reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of their countries it's currently being worked out and gold is part of the plan Putin said it the brics business Forum that we are ready to openly work with all fair partners of five countries are also trying to create an alternative mechanism for international humans he added the case for why the brics countries would use gold it's pretty gosh darn simple more monetary Freedom they want to receive a solid currency that they can control or at least have a larger sayover in return for their goods and of course to avoid sanctions so they can transact freely without the Western countries dictating their moves the head of ing Chris Turner said safety liquidity in return make a great Reserve currency which is why bricks could potentially look toward adding gold into that basket if they're worried about the path of sanctions and the increasing weaponization of the dollar they like Russia might prefer to move into gold now this could definitely be a strong possibility here Russia of course is the third leading gold producer in the world so as of course no surprise that over the decades it has dramatically increased its gold reserves it's also tell telling that these countries are already dabbling into the world of crypto and of course of Central Bank digital currencies these countries went out of the U.S dollar system is it possible we could get a gold-backed stable coin in the future in the forms of a brics currency certainly interesting food for thought and of course that's all happening at the same time that Russia is about to allow Bitcoin for international payments so it's a very interesting coincidence if you will now the second reason that gold could boom in the same reason the Bitcoin can boom and those other store value assets right is because of increased demand from central banks around the world you see gold does well in recessions as we see investors turning to gold for its perceived safety it has produced positive gains in five out of the seven last recessions now as fears have been escalating over last year central banks have been preparing for the worst demand for gold has increased all over the world from central banks and particular we're seeing huge buying sprees according to the world gold Council demand for gold increased by 28 percent in 2022 central banks have been boosting their reserves big time with gold almost as if never before Q3 2022 saw a 55-year high demand for gold from central banks with them buying a record 399 tons worth of gold around 20 billion dollars worth that's almost double the previous record during the same period from back in 2018."", ""South Africa was then subsequently added to the group in 2010 although the coining of the term brick back in 2001 was mostly semantics since then we've seen a stronger Alliance start to form with these nations working together in an economic sense to help Foster stronger global economic terms for these countries today brics countries account for 42 of the global population and 32 percent of global GDP G7 which is regarded as the opposing political Alliance consists of the country's Canada France Germany Italy Japan the United Kingdom and the United States has now started to wane indominance compared to Bricks as you can see from the graph in front of you brics dominance in terms of the total GDP share is starting to flip the share of the G7 as the brics Nations continuously gain power but why does it matter if these nations gain power well because they have an alliance and they're strategically working together to implement measures to better their own currencies Financial Futures but one of the ways that they are doing this is by accepting de-dollarization and starting to settle trade payments in varying currencies back in 2014 Russia and China signed a deal to bypass the US dollar they no longer wanted to rely on the US dollar for international trade and investment the trend is called de-dollarization we are witnessing a rapid shift away from US dollars in international trade we can see this because China's Yuan has replaced the dollar as the most traded currency in Russia China and France have even completed the first Yuan settled LNG trade signaling the end of the use of the dollar for energy trades we've seen China and Brazil pledge to use their own currencies to pay for trade deals and even Saudi Arabia is now entering a trade alliance with China Russia India Pakistan and four Central Asian Nations but the most crazy thing of all is that the brics nations want to develop their own rival currency to the US dollar now whether this will be a success or not no one knows but what we do know is that they're actively working on ways to develop a new currency together and we can see politically their Alliance is only growing stronger now this August in South Africa the brics nations are set to meet to discuss the potential implementation of a new currency so things appear to be ramping up very quickly for the legitimacy of a potential rival currency to the US dollar the leader of China Chi Jinping

to see here everything is fine just move along go about your business buy something invest something don't worry we've got this when questioned about the fact that big Banks were becoming bigger and that power was being Consolidated into even fewer hands Diamond forcefully rejected such a concern but let's kind of go over to another article and check out their point of view there is actually an existing rule preventing any Bank like JP Morgan from making an acquisition providing it with more than 10 percent of all U.S deposits JP Morgan is already above that cap so they're already above the 10 percent but Regulators waived those deposit concentration restrictions and basically blessed the deal anyways the bottom line is that diamond stepped up he cut a deal with the government he was given special privileges making him above the established regulations on banking size and now he's out working the circuit for our sake working for the government trying to calm mine and yours fears well nothing has changed in the banking sector if you understand what brought these Banks down the fact is that unrealized losses on long-term bonds purchased during a period of ultra low interest rates is basically a problem that's shared by every financial institution every single Bank in the entire world we looked at Jamie diamonds Banks and saw that they had a massive unrealized loss and there's a lot of people in the media that are trying to compare this current situation to the 2008 banking crisis and they're completely different the banking crisis from 2008 was based on sketchy high-risk Bank decisions in an ultra low regulatory environment but the problem that we're facing now is that this time the banks actually played it safe but it still backfired on them the current crisis is built on U.S treasuries which are considered very safe and long-term mortgages which are also considered relatively safe that have lost tremendous value you do to a transition from a no rate or low rate to a high rate environment the rate increases of the past year mark the first time in history that the central bank had basically tightened monetary policy while the banking system was flooded with excess cash so this is not a bridge that we've crossed before and nobody nobody in the government not Jamie dimon knows how to solve it or what the outcome is ultimately going to be and on another note a different voice in Wall Street chimed in today on the banking problems and that was Charlie Munger who I believe is actually telling the truth now he said banks are full of bad loans on commercial property he went on to say in good times we get into bad habits when the bad times come they the banks lose too much money Charlie is 99 years old man this guy's got a lot of insight and he has nothing left to gain or lose and in my view he's the one that's telling us the straight truth and I personally believe him of course the banks are in trouble the fact is the bank in Christ has actually barely started it's going to be followed by a credit crunch businesses are suddenly not going to be able to roll over their loans or borrow any money and that is going to throw the economy into Panic as everyone who owns a business is going to be scrambling to find some cash just to survive we're not talking about growing we're talking about surviving and we've also seen in retail credit it hitting new highs which is also going to feed into more of a credit crisis and that brings us back to Apple where is all the easy money going to come from that's going to push Apple stock to four trillion dollars that's the question I'm laying to you guys today I don't have the answer to that I'm needing you guys to tell me and in conclusion I've been asked a lot about two different plays I've been asked about Apple calls or buying the sqq and as I've said regarding the Apple calls the only way that you would consider buying Apple calls going into this earnings if you can sit there and you can watch it you need to be able to cut that loose immediately if it begins ends to go against you you've got to be very attentive to that particular play I personally lean towards getting into swing trades that last a little bit longer ones that I can enter and leave in a couple days a couple weeks or even a couple months you guys know I've been patiently waiting on the sqq but timing is still of essence it did reach my target which is I gave everybody when this thing was in the 30s I said guys my Buy Signal is 28 and now we've gotten to that place and I have entered a small position my purpose in entering a small position is because that allows me to put more focus and energy on that particular trade but we need to also keep in mind that Apple can push the NASDAQ higher if Apple comes out and kills it it will cause all of big Tech to go higher which would absolutely cause the sqq to break down and it could go anywhere from 28 dollars to ultimately twenty dollars and"", ""2021 annual report suggests that it only has around 120 billion dollars in its Insurance Fund this is a drop in the bucket compared to the 19 trillion dollars of Bank deposits in the U.S and a speck of sand in the desert of the derivatives Market which could be in the quadrillions luckily there's the third rule of bank balins which states that you will be given some alternative asset in exchange for your lost deposits now believe it or not but these alternative assets are typically shares in the bank that you bailed out let that sink in the bank takes your money and gives you its worthless stock in return not only that but if governments manage to pass laws to make Central Bank digital currencies or cbdc's legal tender you could very well be paid back in cbdc instead of cash come to think of it bank balance would be the perfect way to force people to adopt cbdc's and perhaps that's the whole point speculation aside it's important to note that you could temporarily lose access to your funds during a bank Balin as we've seen with Cyprus Banks could put limits on their hours of operations limits on payments limits on transfers and limits on cash withdrawals until the bail in process is complete more evidence comes from a bank Balin document from the Bank of Scotland which suggests that it could take up to a week for you to get your insured deposits back I imagine there would be a similar lag for other banks around the world make no mistake the social unrest that would trigger would be truly unprecedented now the people in power appear to be hyper aware of this because they've apparently been running Bank Balin simulations for years the most recent high-profile Bank simulation was held by the FDIC in November last year although the FDIC simulation is publicly available it's predictably hard to find the simulation featured dozens of panelists from prominent financial institutions and Regulators that you've probably never heard of as you might have guessed one of them was Wilson Irvin who seems to keep a very low profile these days despite or maybe because of being the Chief Architect of the bank Balin process now I'll leave a link to the full simulation in the description if you're interested but I'll reiterate that it's hard to find even with the link I'll also caution that it's lengthy and contains lots of financial jargon in any case the most exciting stuff begins around the one hour mark Snippets from this section went viral at roughly 1 hour and 18 minutes one of the panelists Ponders how the FDIC and its secret allies should maintain the Public's confidence in the financial system when the balines inevitably happen she argues that transparency is the answer but that some entities should get more transparency than others this particular panelist also made an off-the-cuff comment about making sure the public understands that quote prior compensation could be clawed back now maybe I'm hearing things but that sounds like it's possible for the banks to take your money long after the bailing process has been completed she even asked the other panelists how they can quote address excess cash use in such a crisis this suggests that governments could very well be planning on introducing a cbdc using bank balins then again it could just be a reference to the freeze on cash withdrawals I was talking about earlier as a cherry on top the panelist also said that they should quote make the announcement on a Friday ideally a Friday night for context Fridays are famous for being one of the days when nobody pays attention to the news hence why bad news often comes out on Fridays the more you know a second panelist agreed with the first about being selective with transparency about the bailin and specified that they should tell the banks and big investors first he said they shouldn't tell the public until later because they would Panic a third panelist agreed with the second and said something sinister along the lines of the public has more faith in the banking system than we do let's keep it that way the other panelists laughed he went on to repeat that only institutional investors should know what's going on and they should quote be careful with what we tell the public but wait there's more a fourth panelist then said something even more Sinister I had to listen to it three times because I couldn't quite believe what I was hearing the timestamp is around 1 hour and 27 minutes she literally says quote the information should go out once we're moving out of the recession make of that what you will this fourth panelist went on to explain that non-bank entities including cryptocurrency exchanges should be included in the bailing process now this could mean that she wants them to be subject to acquisition by big Banks or that she wants to use the crypto you hold on exchanges to bail them in a little later Wilson said that they must make sure that disinformation about bank balins doesn't get out before the fact check approved version of events he even went as far as suggesting that this online censorship should happen in advance so that people don't talk about their money being taken it just so happens that governments around the world are in the process of rolling out exactly these kinds of online censorship laws and most of them will be going into Force later this year or next year you can find out all about that using the link in the description I strongly suggest watching that video"", ""he explained that the desire to develop an alternative to bailouts increased after the financial crisis started to affect Europe in mid-2012 the international monetary fund or IMF published a paper advocating for bailins as the ideal alternative to bailouts the IMF paper had almost the same title as The Economist article by Paul and Wilson from two years earlier all the IMF needed was somewhere to test this new Balin method enter Cyprus now Cyprus was one of the European countries that was hit the hardest when the 2008 contagion spread to the continent by the end of 2012 Cyprus was on the brink of default and begging for a bailout in early 2013 the IMF and the European Union bailed Cyprus out for 10 billion euros as with all IMF loans the bailout came with multiple conditions one of the conditions was for cyprus's largest bank to execute the first ever bail in almost 50 percent of all bank account balances worth more than one hundred thousand Euros were seized a substantial proportion of these funds reportedly belonged to Russian oligarchs Cyprus was also required to take 6.9 percent of all Bank balances lower than 100 000 and 9.9 percent of all Bank balances higher than 100 000 regardless of the bank despite the social chaos and capital controls that ensued the first ever Bank Balin was declared a success by the IMF and its allies in 2014 the G20 countries agreed to pass bail in laws in accordance with the financial stability board or fsbs bail in guidelines the fsb's guidelines include the issuance of bail in bonds which should be sold to Pension funds newsflash this means your pension money could be used to bail out Banks too the United States was the first to legalize bailins in 2010 with the aforementioned Dodd-Frank Act the UK followed suit in 2013 with the financial services act the EU legalized bailins in 2016 with the bank recovery and resolution directive so be sure to check when your country legalized bailins and if you think this is crazy you should check out our video about digital ID that will be down in the description anyways I must stress that the specifics of Bank Balin laws tend to vary from country to Country unfortunately I don't have the time to get into the details about each one here however all these bailing laws seem to follow the same three rules likely because of their Collective Conformity with the FSB the first rule is that bank balines are only allowed for banks that are deemed to be domestically or globally important it's not entirely clear which banks fall into the domestically important category but it's safe to assume that this rule pertains to those with the most assets under management as for globally important Banks the FSB publishes a list of them every year along with their de facto risk of default due to derivatives debt there are currently 30 globally systemically important banks with JP Morgan being noted as the highest risk JB Morgan reportedly has 60 to 70 trillion dollars of derivatives dead if you're wondering what happens when a non-systemically important Bank goes under the answer seems to be that they get to be acquired by a domestically or globally important Bank if that wasn't wild enough Regulators are trying to apply these laws to crypto exchanges more on that in a moment now the second rule of bank balins is that they do not apply to bank balances below the deposit Insurance threshold in the U.S the FDIC covers 250 000 of deposits in the UK the fscs covers 85 000 pounds and in the EU""]"
39,38,54,38_units_margin_risk_leverage,"['units', 'margin', 'risk', 'leverage', 'stop loss', 'loss', 'account', 'stop', 'position', 'risk tolerance']","[""and you want to risk 10 on this trade well if that's the case do you think you can actually do it now with a 50 pip stop instead of a five pip stop let's take a look with a 50 pip stop loss if we want to risk 10 then how much does each pip need to be worth that would mean that each pip would need to be worth 20 cents so if each pip needs to be worth 20 cents we already discussed this one micro lot is equal to 10 cents per pip and how much is a micro lot 1 000 units of currency so at this point we would need 2 000 units in order to place this trade so now just because we increased the size of the stop loss we can actually place this trade and still have 8 000 units left over because we're just taking that 2 000 units off of our 10 000 units of buying power so this is another way to avoid the insufficient margin situation is by doing nothing more than increasing the time frame you're trading on increasing the size of your stop loss because the bigger the stop loss the less amount of units you're going to need in order to equal that 10 risk or whatever your risk is you can by the way before i end the video you can exchange these numbers for any number at all and the equations are still exactly the same again if there was something here you didn't understand rewind the video and check it out i just wanted to get this out to you guys really quickly didn't happen to be that quickly looks like i'm above 15 minutes at this point"", ""and if not here's a little lesson for you a mini lot or 10 000 units of currency is normally equal to one dollar per pip is what that is normally worth so with this being the case if we are trying to have a five pip stop loss equal ten dollars of risk how many units of this currency will we have to buy for this situation to play out we will need all we have to do is multiply this by two right we need this to be two dollars per pip because in order to have a ten dollar risk on five pips of stop loss we need two dollars per pip to equal that ten dollar risk right so if 10 000 units is one dollar per pip then 20 000 units is what we need to purchase in order to make this trade happen and the reason we get the message that says insufficient margin is because you cannot hold 20 000 units of any currency or any pair while you only have 10 000 units of buying power does that make sense so this is the first reason your broker will say no to you every time you try to make this trade the reason they say no is because you are attempting to use 20 000 units on an account where you can only have 10 000 units of buying power and what is the cause of all this your stop-loss being too small the reason you're you're having this situation is because you have too small of a stop-loss and you're trying to risk too much money with that small stop-loss so let's talk about way number two that's the first way that you're going to get that message of insufficient funds insufficient margin whatever your brokerage calls it is because you're trying to hold whether your risk remember our risk right now we're still we're trying to risk only ten dollars so in most beginners heads it makes sense that i should be able to risk ten dollars on a hundred dollar account but the other two steps are to find out how many units i have to hold in order for this ten dollar risk to exist and in this case that would be twenty thousand units which your brokerage will not allow if you can only have uh 10 000 units of buying power so hopefully that made sense if it didn't watch that a couple of times i'm gonna try to make this into like a pretty short video the concepts are just pretty simple math"", ""so let's get started as we discussed in our last lesson many people put down 20% in cash to obtain their mortgage which puts their leverage at five to one the 20% down payment that many home buyers put down to obtain their mortgage is the equivalent to the margin that a trader puts up to purchase a financial instrument such as a currency pair when trading on margin most forex trading firms will offer leverage of up to one hundred to one or more which requires traders to put up only one thousand dollars and margin for every one hundred thousand and positions traded if fully used this would take a one percent move in a currency pair and turn it into a one hundred percent gain or loss on the value of your account the easiest way to understand this is by seeing it in real time by logging into our real time demo trading accounts if you've not done so already I encourage you to pause this video now and click click the link above this video if you're watching on inform trades comm or to the right of this video if you're watching on YouTube and register for free real time demo so you can follow along as well once logged into the platform in the upper right hand corner you should see a window that says accounts in this window from right to left you should see the following columns the first column is the accounts column this lists your account number and if you are trading multiple accounts the other accounts your trading would be listed here as well the balance column this lists the amount of money in your account not including any profit or loss on open positions the equity column this lists the amount of money in your account including any profit or loss on open positions day P&L this is the gain or loss on any open positions for the trading day which begins and ends at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on this particular platform the USD mr column this stands for used margin and is the amount of money in your account which has been allocated for margining your open positions if you have no open positions this column will read zero so go ahead and click the dealing rates and open up a one contract position if you have multiple positions open go ahead and close out the additional positions by clicking on the close rate in the closed column beside those positions so that you have only one position of one contract open once you do this you should see the amount in the use margin column at one thousand dollars if you remember from our previous lessons we are trading a contract size of 100,000 of the base currency which puts the leverage which has been extend to extended to us on this particular demo account at exactly one hundred to one four currency pairs in which the US dollar is the base currency and somewhere near one hundred to one for currency pairs in which it is not and the next column over you should see a column that says US BLM R which stands for usable margin this is the amount of money that you have in your account including any profit or loss on open positions that is over and above the money allocated to margin any open positions in the account another way of looking at this column is that the usable margin column is equal to the equity column minus the used margin column if the number in this column drops to zero then the trading platform will automatically generate a margin call and close the open positions on your account with this in mind it's important to always have a clear understanding of how much money you need in your account to open each new position so you not over leveraged yourself or worse end up in a margin call situation we are going to get into more in-depth examples in our next lesson but to quickly demonstrate the relationship between the years margin and the usable margin columns let's left-click in the dealing rates window and open a to lock position of Eurodollar which will bring the total in our account to 3 open contracts once that position is open the number in your use margin column should have gone up by 2,000 to account for the two additional contracts we just open and the amount in your usable margin column should have gone down by 2,000 as we discussed in our last lesson not respecting the amount of leverage offered in the forex market is probably the number one reason why many traders not only fail when trying to trade the forex market but lose their entire account balance while the market is not a volatile market in and of itself you can turn it into a highly volatile instrument by upping the amount of leverage used which puts your account balance and therefore your trading career at risk that's our lesson for today in our next lesson we look at several examples of leverage at work on our forex trading demo accounts so we can start to get a feel for what an appropriate amount of leverage may be so we hope to see you in that lesson as always if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them in the comment section below and good luck with your trading""]"

um this was also in the news as well just as another uh tidbit"", ""and so does that mean we're going to all have different coins and does that mean we're going back to where we are where there's a lack of interoperability don't get it in quote an addition Garlin house says he's struggling to find a coherent use case for JPM coin even if the goal is to have it used internally at JPMorgan he said one more quick thing on JPM coin so let's think about this JPM coin they announced for institutional clients if you gave them a dollar deposit they'll give you a JPM coin that you can then move within the JPM ledger he said wait a minute just use the dollar I really don't understand if you're just giving just moving it within the JPM ledger and it has to be $1 $2 and 1/2 I'm backing I don't understand what problem that solves end quote last month reports surfaced that JPMorgan is starting a new trial that will utilize the company's digital asset JPMorgan coin to settle transactions with his wholesale business clients the blockchain based solution payment solution was initially will initially be tested with a tiny fraction of the company's clientele so the situation that we have right now as we slowly learn more about the JP Morgan coin first of all uh I find it hard to believe that other banks would be using JP Morgan's coins simply because other banks don't like JP Morgan Chase and other banks it's kind of a weird situation like you're probably not gonna find a scenario where Bank of America or PNC are going to agree to use another banks cryptocurrency especially when the weird part is is that the JP Morgan coin is supposed to only be used internally within the JP Morgan Space website and app whatever what-have-you they're saying that it's for quick transfers obviously though I mean it's it's just a really weird situation when it comes to Jamie Dimon who's the CEO of JP Morgan he said that he hated Bitcoin and crypto currencies for a very long time he thought that crypto currencies had no use and now they have tried are trying to create their own crypto currency and I don't know if I can call it a crypto currency especially because as according to reports if you kind of look around it appears that this is only going to be used internally and even more so the people who are going to be allowed to use this will be some of the very richest people who are actually like it says even right here like large institutional JPMorgan clients we can assume that eventually they're probably going to roll out something where everyone on their platform and not just very rich people are able to use the JPMorgan coin but it seems very weird that you would have to have US Dollars and then swap them into the coin and then I don't know it seems a bit pointless I mean we don't know exactly what they're planning this is not the first time that JPMorgan has kind of hinted at something like this has done something similar to this they haven't created their own coin before this feels like an attention-grabbing money grab if that kind of makes any sense in the foreseeable future I do not see a scenario where other banks around the world or even within the United States especially if you've ever watched a documentary on how banks really run they are probably not too keen on listing another banks who they're usually not at war with but you know everyone likes to have their own profits in the banking industry like they're not trying to share customers that they would even think about using another banks coin and this is why crypto currencies and also XRP included are very interesting because the entire idea is that if you all use just one thing and that's kind of agnostic and not exactly through the banking industry you can transfer money between yourselves I have a very strong feeling at some point my you know just my opinion Brad Garlin how has probably met Jamie Dimon at some point and according to rumors Jamie Dimon is probably not the nicest person in the entire world so they probably had a little exchange of words and now this is what JP Morgan I have"", ""his name is Greg Kidd he's a very wealthy rich I don't know how much money

part of their roadmap trying to talk about what exactly is going to be going on as they go further into the project they say that our next major step in the roadmap is to go live with our beta testing on maintenance they should have been in the early part of quarter two which is where we are now and we'll be announcing further information on how this testing will take place over the next few weeks across our various social channels based on the success of this test period will be we will be aiming to go live with our first operator by the close of quarter 2 that is around the June end of June

updates to existing offerings if you have not checked their website they have a an area we can pretty much check and see the things that they plan on launching they said that they're not finalized yet but they wanted to give people an idea of what type of platform and what type of games they were going to have through funfair throughout quarter 2 and beyond our team will continue to represent the company at a number of international events on the gaming calendar where the trips to g2e Asia and a disruptive online gaming conference in London among the numerous dates in the diary they also say that they are going to try their darkness so they will start giving more information on the project so exactly what's going on and it continued and quicker pace on discord and on telegram because people always like to have information about the projects that they are getting into last stop this is another very interesting one and I'll explain a bit after mainstream Financial Analysts might be fixated on Bitcoin so called death cross which apparently Bitcoin cross earlier I don't know if you guys have pretty sure a lot of you have been looking at other people's cryptocurrency videos a lot of people have been showing this thing on a graph that Bitcoin was going to cross or pass the death cross it was an indicator that there was gonna be a gigantic downtrend and the currency would fall

prices go up and down these people know how to work the markets they have people who work for them who know how to work the markets and they're making a tremendous amount of money day trading and using BOTS to trade because of the volatility in the market you may think that people are losing money when when prices go down and they are not because they have people and BOTS like I said before who know exactly what they're doing and how to play the market so that they get money even as the market goes down he says the institution of interest is already starting to tick up in Japan which he said is a leading indicator of what will soon happen in the West regardless of retail interest which has seen a sharp decline in recent months there really is a zero large scale there really is ZERO large scale institution to money from the West and crypto right now this is already happening Japan once a large sizable chunk of Western institution and money starts to come in watch out this is probably going to happen once we get all the regulations in place Japan and South Korea and I may be one or two other places they know or have been told by their governments what these coins are what is this what is that their SEC has already jumped in and said what is going to be what it's pretty much down to Europe and the us who are pretty much saying that they will tell everybody sometime around June what all these things are not sure how many of you have been with me in this channel for a very long time this is what I was talking about before we there is no there's no rich money in the market yet everything that has kind of flown in has come from normal investors that's you and me and other people who are just trying to make an extra buck on the side once we have billionaires actually dumping their money into this this will not happen until they have proper framework for exactly what's going on like I've said before in other videos you will not have someone dump 500 million dollars into the market until they know exactly what they're going to have to pay in taxes because lord forbid should these people make any type of money""]"

and i'm still going to be putting out two to three videos on this channel just like i do every week if you really want to prioritize something and make it happen uh you've just got to do it now my fourth tip is to take calculated risks whether that's in your business life whether that is in your investing life i think it's important to take calculated risks we talk all the time on the channel about how to minimize risk in your investments that's one of the main topics of this channel but still there is no such thing as a risk-free investment at least not one that's going to generate a reasonable return and help propel your net worth forward over a long period of time you know robert kiyosaki again from rich dad poor dad often talks about how people that don't have substantial net worths that they've built over time are often absolutely terrified of losing money and although losing money is not good and it can sit you back and all that kind of stuff i think a lot of really wealthy people take calculated risks if you take one of my favorite investors on the planet monash probably um he says that even the best investment analysts in the world are wrong at least one third of the time and regardless of that he's still being able to generate really good investment returns and grow not only his own personal net worth but also the net worth of his investors and his investment fund so take calculated risks another story i love from monash is that uh you know he was working an everyday job he went out and started his own business on the side while still working that job and that meant that if his business failed he could still continue his job and as that business took off he had no risk he had you know a little bit of money initially put into that business to get it up and running but if the whole thing fell over he still had his job there um on the back burner that's tip number four take calculated risks uh lots of really wealthy people have lost a lot of money over their journey but there's a whole lot of less wealthy people that have frankly never lost a sin because they've just been too scared to go out and start businesses or make investments now tip number five for building your net worth much quicker than the average person is to set goals this is something that i've done personally uh for many years for not just my finances but for other goals that i have in life whether that's sport related or family related or whatever it might be i think it's really important to set goals and i think it's important to be accountable to yourself for those goals um this year for the first time i have put my goals out there publicly on this youtube channel so you can go back and watch a video that i did towards the start of the year on my goals for 2020 i also did an update video so you can sort of keep track of how i am going um and i think it's really important i think it pushes you i think it stops you from sitting still and just you know doing the same thing on repeat all the time i think it does help push you forward a lot um so that's the goal that i really like i like to set achievable"", ""and then i will see you in the

significant rally each time previously as we can see right now the current level is dropping dramatically coming off record levels this could potentially push for record rallies the 12 multiple for Bitcoin has just left the green zone the last time this happened it was a game changer for Bitcoin we can see right before a massive rally as a matter of fact it predates pretty much every parabolic Bitcoin rally when it leaves the pwell multiple green zone we can see right now Bitcoin is looking very very similar to what it did with the 2017-2018 bear Market when we take a look at the volume profile analysis the POC line Bitcoin fell below there came right back above and then it was not long before we saw rally well we have Bitcoin falling below that POC line just breaking back above there might not be too long before we have that rally everyone's looking for the daily gaussian channels showed historically two times reaching green before eventually the third long green when the bottom was in this comparison shows a high possibility reaching new highs in the near future with the same analysis we can see green zone one green zero two eventually three was when things started ticking off so we have green zone one two and eventually three is things starting to tick off the stochastic RSI is indicating a bull run comeback seems inevitable on the one month chart when it enters the green zone which is getting close to entering it will be be the confirmation we need something worth keeping an eye on right now Bitcoin has reclaimed the 0.236 line this red line on the MZ

finding support on the two-day RSI at support line consolidation is drying up now previous times we saw this support it wasn't long before Bitcoin prices went up the suggesting bitcoin price could go up as a matter of fact flipping the broadening wedge for the top and bottom we had a right angled ascending broadening wedge flipped to the bottom now we have a right angled descending broadening wedge which should flip to the top after we have some consolidation from the breakout so this is suggest prices would be going up as a matter of fact falling wedge as well finding support on the 38 to FIB right here basically the previous time that this happened falling wedge support broke out of their massive rally again three-day candles falling wedge support on 38.2 FIB breaking out which we're seeing right here could have a massive rally following right now the sell side risk ratio is approaching all time lows very interesting to note you can see this down here pretty much doesn't get much lower than this the last time it was in this territory was as a matter of fact right before Bitcoin exploded from ten thousand to seventy thousand dollars now this indicates that investors are reluctant to spend coins which are in profit or loss within the current price range this usually occurs when sellers are exhausted on both sides suggesting big moves are coming once again just like this sideways movement wedge inside of a wedge big moves are coming where are they coming well how about this daily macd lines crossing a bullish Divergence showing on the histogram we can see this

this downtrend right now is at 27.6 can we break outside of this downtrend and hold it interesting question now it appears like everyone just got faked out once again based on the 200ma of the 12 hour candles on the downtrend we had fake outs to the upside and it looks like on the uptrend we have fake apps to the downside once again Bitcoin right now repeating what we saw in 2014 to 2017 we're here to break down we had some resistance a few times and broke between there and once we broke above finding support taking off well same exact thing where we broke down resistance a few times now we are in between pretty much where we were in this area could be a nice setup for Bitcoin but it appears like that area where Bitcoin is sitting is it Wick off accumulation mode Bitcoin has completed the macro Wick off accumulation the whole accumulation lasted for one year now phase after accumulation would be markup phase that's right after whales get all the Bitcoin they can at cheap prices well the price goes up and they start selling that Bitcoin it turns out that while a lot of people are saying crypto is over we do have a bullish Divergence right here on the price and if we take a look on a macro scale where we are markup correction accumulation and then markup phase this is what we saw uh previously with the total market cap where once we broke this downtrend and found support on there took off for a new markup phase well look at where we are right now broke above the downtrend finding support there could potentially be the next markup phase it turns out that based on the November 28th Cycles Theory uh it remains perfectly on track and still calls for thirty four and a half thousand dollars by November of this year the next Blue year will establish time around the price before advancing to new all-time highs so tell me why are you still worried we are still on track for Price going up slowly at first and then after the halfing much more quickly as a matter of fact it's likely that crypto and NASDAQ are likely to follow the Nikki McKay into high levels new all-time highs well for crypto that would be a large increase to go back up to new all-time Highs but you can see all of these have broken through previous downtrends and at least the Nick hey and NASDAQ have had pretty good gains crypto is still pretty sideways since breaking outside of there now for

is your income if you make too much money you won't be able to contribute to a Roth IRA now that doesn't impact your Roth 401k you could be making a million dollars a year and still participate in your Roth 401k so as long as your employer provides one so the second part do you think you should have both does it make sense to have a Roth 401 K and a Roth IRA if you're like me and the big believer that taxes are only gonna go up over the years then I would definitely do both when I first start saving for my retirement when I was in my 20s as well so see we're both on the same page I was doing a Roth IRA and a traditional 401k now at the time the Roth 401k was not available had it been available I definitely would have took part so"", ""hi fools I'm Dan Kaplan your Motley Fool contributor and I'm here today with our ask a fool series today's question comes from Roselle melodious who asks which is better a 457 plan or a 401 k plan now Roselle brings up a question that's really difficult for a lot of people to understand with all these numbers referring to IRS Code sections of the tax law but basically what we're talking about is a 401 K which is a normal retirement plan that employers in the private sector offer to their employees to help them save for retirement versus a 457 plan which is a similar type of plan that is usually offered to government employees and for most purposes they're very similar both tend to have limited menus of investment options that people can choose from and so in general my advice would be for someone to consider which investment options are better if the 401 K gives you a better set of low-cost investment options typically mutual funds or exchange-traded funds then the 457 then go with the 401 K on the other hand if your 457 plan offers better investment options that have lower costs and better potential returns then that's a reasonable choice to make as well now there's one aspect where 457 plans and 401 k plans especially differ and that has to do with penalties for early withdrawals 401 k plans if you take money out early before you turn age 59 and a half the money you take out is subject to a 10% penalty but that penalty doesn't apply to early withdrawals from 457 plans and so if you anticipate an early retirement where you're going to need to draw money from your plan then putting more money in a 457 may be your better bet if that's not a if that's not a problem however what you're really going to want to focus on is those investment choices and making sure you get the best deal that will help your investments grow as much as possible for more on saving for retirement in the various tax advantaged plans that are available be sure to stay tuned to to fool.com thanks for watching and fool on"", ""hello fools driver bro campus in your advisor for The Motley Fool's rule your retirement service as part of our ask a full series we have a question from Gil Gil asked what are the rules laws and regulations whereby a first time homebuyer can take a distribution from a Roth IRA to fund a home purchase and what are the tax implications involved so first of all let's define what a first-time homebuyer is it doesn't mean that you've never owned a home it just means that you've not owned a home in the past two years and to use this exception for any sort of IRA with the first-time home purchase it has to be for your principle residents can't be for any investment investment property or anything like that the general rule is for both traditional and Roth IRAs is that you can take out ten thousand dollars per person twenty thousand dollars per couple to use for a home purchase and you will not be subject to the ten percent penalty that most distributions are subject to when you take it out before fifty nine and a half now the interesting thing about the Roth IRA is that actually for any situation you can take out the contributions the money that you put in tax and penalty free because you already paid the taxes on it any growth and earnings you cannot take out before age 59 and a half except for some exceptions and one of those exceptions is the first-time homebuyer but only if the account has been open for five years if it has been open for five years you can take all that money out tax-free for the first-time home purchase if it has not been open for five years it is treated just like the traditional IRA when it comes to home purchases and that is the money the earnings are taxed as ordinary income you just escape the ten percent penalty the other thing you need to remember about this is that you don't have forever to do it you have a hundred and twenty days between the time you take the money out and the time you put it towards the home purchase so don't take it out too early I hope that answers your question Gail if you have any other questions about home buying taxes investing visit us on Facebook or fool.com""]"

higher lows here and outperform traditional equity markets supposedly more speculative asset doing better than equities that's a really solid telltale sign that all the while we might have a little bit more correction to go the worst is behind us now one big thing i want to emphasize here is that it may not be the same picture for all coins to be honest with you all the trended altcoins is a little bit more uncertain here even on the logarithmic chart we can see that all coins have already pulled back about 50 percent relatively similar to bitcoin and ethereum but i have to be honest with you all the future of all coins is a little less certain for one big reason it has to do with the fact that institutional interest in these assets which are really what's holding up bitcoin ethereum institutional investors that is institutions aren't all that crazy about alternative cryptocurrencies outside of these two assets when we're really talking about you know if you were to survey the kind of sentiment that institutional investors have for the under uh the cryptocurrencies under the top two versus bitcoin and ethereum which at the top two you'd probably find a lot more eager to get into bitcoin ethereum first before getting into all coins all coins are heavily retail driven now i talk a lot about this concept here of the difference between these two markets here in the focus and on top of that dive a lot deeper in this conversation around kind of the worst case scenario here and why we are not getting bearish at this point even if we consider the fact that we might correct a little bit more in this month's dash report now if you guys haven't checked it out already the dash report is a newsletter we write here on the channel and i go through and give a whole macro overview of the current crypto space equities commodities and forex and boy is it an exciting time for everywhere in the world of finance it's a great way you guys can support the channel if you love my ramblings here and you want to get that in writing fashion and maybe go a little bit deeper than what we do here on the channel definitely check it out and you can set it for an annual subscription get 20 off links down below in the description but if you guys are interested in this topic we're going to be covering that in this month's newsletter i want to go ahead though and dive further into the conversation here though and i want to go ahead and use one of the favorite data science models that i use just for the pure simplicity that it offers here because sometimes models can be so complex in nature and they can over almost in a sense can compromise the ability to simplify investing in order to come out on top against the market and the two-year ma multiplier here is a metric that just simply looks at the two-year moving average a very solid moving average metric that long-term investors look for value investing and it multiplies it by five in order to understand where cycle tops or overbought periods of time in the market not just bull market tops may be and i want to go ahead and just emphasize here what's really happening over time now you notice in the past year we used to have exacerbations beyond the five-year m.a as well as below the five-year m.a or excuse me below the two-year moving average the standard one you can see that we had for example price of three dollars above the five-year m.a which was turning around eight dollars we saw a similar pattern here of two hundred fourteen dollars above the five year inmate sixty three dollars we saw here around a thousand one hundred eighty four almost twelve hundred dollars above the five year inmate which was three hundred twenty nine dollars and sixty one cents at the time and even back here we saw in december 2017 nearly nineteen thousand dollars where the ma was less than half of that"", ""so we've got practically if we're taking a look at the measurement supply for ethereum i think somewhere generally between five to seven point five percent of the entire ethereum supply locked away until eth is finally live this eat is not liquid it's not accessible it's removed effectively from the supply and on top of that to make matters even better for ethereum in the sense of price appreciation there's eip1559 which effectively burns some of the eat that's collected to pay for network fees and again just in the past six months not even full six months yet we're coming up on it soon we've burned an effective 1.7 million ethereum the more the chain is used the more heath is burned and removed from the slot and supply forever and this has led to a dramatic decrease in the inflation rate of ethereum and on top of that when the merge is complete once we finally move to proof of stake where the network is starting to change the way consensus is met this is going to potentially bring us if we're at consistent gas consumption i would assume it's probably going to decline because we'll have more scale on layer one with sharding as we go throughout time but the important thing to understand is that with that proof of stake merge in this case where we move from proof of work so basically ethereum mining to proof of stake this would put ethereum in deflationary territory so you've got an asset that has consistent demand right there's obviously a growing institutional demand retail demand to buying these crypto assets over time as it's a growing asset class and it's the favorite among millennials in gen z but outside of that as well we've also got a shrinking supply and that in this manner this deflationary element is not even factoring in each that might be put aside into the staking contract here in the short term"", ""they just released their V2 now the most important and critical element of this V2 upgrade is that it's now going to allow for users to be able to withdraw their ethereum should of course they desire to do so that being said the current APR for staked ethereum Steph right via Lido Finance is an insane eight percent and deposits into the ethereum staking contract again are still far outpacing withdrawal that's not even comparable in fact the only major withdrawals so far from the staking contract of Lido Finance have been from Celsius right for legal reasons Lido activating withdrawals much like ethereum activating withdrawals not a bearish event in my opinion it's actually a bullish event because it gives more confidence for more staking money to come in to Lido Finance in other ethereum news layer 2 optimism has given a firm release date for their big Bedrock upgrade optimism is the second most popular layer 2 for ethereum after arbitrum of course this update could be a real game changer for optimism now June 6th is the day of upgrade is scheduled to go live the upgrade could actually see an estimated 47 reduction in total fees as well as enhanced compatibility with the main ethereum blockchain now it remains to be seen if this will actually help improve their total market share or not especially as we have all these other hungry layer 2 competitors flooding into the space coming online they got the work cut out for them and let's talk about curve Finance I love curve Finance got myself a bag and it's a critical piece of defy infrastructure it is basically the most important stable swap protocol in the entire Dam crypto industry those guys they just deployed their CRV USD stablecoin on the ethereum maina I know what you're thinking ah none of us stablecoin manler come on how many of these we need well apparently one more this week they open up a nice simple user interface for it and the stable coin if successful I think could drive some serious Revenue back into the hands of CRV token stakers and with curve Finance being the biggest stable swap protocol out there the chances of this happening seem pretty pretty high to me personally so definitely keeping staking those for the time being next

range we were talking about here as a matter of fact twenty four thousand dollars is the projected price from this head and shoulders right here also there is a CME Gap to fill at twenty four thousand

actually performing well and is expected for this stage of the cycle a clear Bitcoin breakout above the realized price 140 days after we can see a clear price Above This level same thing happened right now Bitcoin is still sitting nicely above they realize price as a matter of fact what this could be is whale accumulation could you believe it the whales once again manipulating the markets so they can buy cheaper Bitcoin would you believe it"", ""so those are important levels to keep an eye out for for Bitcoin but as we speak Bitcoin is basically fighting for price between about twenty thousand dollars and twenty three two night right now though across the markets we're seeing levels of panic that have only been seen five other times since 1994 30 years has only seen this type of panic five other times and guess what every other time it was basically when the markets were at a low before a massive rally and soon you know what could cause that rally well the one thing that's been crashing the markets dxy going up all of a sudden breaking down to unheard of levels breaking down below covid-19 resistance levels support levels also breaking down below this macro uptrend line this could cause USD to drop significantly and just take a look at this chart what happens when usdt drops bitcoin price goes up so those are very very important things to consider now as for the moment the coin values days destroyed has been support for Bitcoin defended for two months straight the first proper test across from covid-19 in the 2019 lows also seen at the 2015 lows this could suggest that the bottom has been in solid accumulation for months at 16 000 as a matter of fact we're seeing the super Trend Buy Signal on the five day flashing a Buy Signal for the first time in over a year the last time this happened bitcoin price went up 239 percent that's like 2.4 x from where the price is just flashed a Buy Signal as a matter of fact if we take a look at this looking at the RSI cups when we had breakouts from these cups this basically began a new cycle for Bitcoin we had the teal and then the blue and then the purple and then the red and now we're on to the orange cup which could lead Bitcoin to some pretty spectacular territory as we have at a breakout from that RSI just recently but you know what happens before the big Bitcoin event the halfing that everybody talks about the Litecoin having it turns out Bitcoin Litecoin approaching the halfing in previous Cycles Litecoin led the Market's new uptrend this is due to Litecoin have things occurring less than one year before the Bitcoin having usually spells the end of the bear Market let's see what happens July 2023 by this summer Litecoin hacking will happen you can see Litecoin price takes up first then Bitcoin follows Litecoin first Bitcoin follows we see Litecoin ticking up first potentially Bitcoin soon to follow we have had a characteristic breakout with each previous Bitcoin Bull Run each time Bitcoin had a green candle which broke through the 81.6 FIB each time this occurred this was pretty much the definitive move before massive rallies that ensued for Bitcoin we just had this green candle break through the 81.6 FIB which was at twenty thousand three hundred dollars almost the same we could potentially see the same exact thing happening for Bitcoin if that doesn't convince you how about on a monthly time frame I love longer time frame charts because you can't fake them out they give you a lot more information than the short little daily or four hour charts but this Bitcoin monthly green candles and RSA oscillator trigger bull run the fourth time in history each time we've had a green candle here in the RSI oscillator which we can see when this basically flips down here well that has begun the beginning of each major Bull Run for Bitcoin we're having it happen right now this is the first monthly candle this is like getting in at the ground floor"", ""but we have dumb money leading the bearish charge for Bitcoin turns out whenever dumb money confidence is high well these correlate with local tops this time is not different as dumb money confidence was high and the price comes down for SPX but for Bitcoin the time to accumulate is ticking away Bitcoin accumulation free Phase is nearing the end according to the Williams percent R I hope you were scooping up while it was possible you can see down here the Williams percent R when it's below this red line right here these are ideal accumulation periods we are just about leaving that territory right now so suggesting the time is running out and we're going to take a look at exactly why it could be happening sooner than anyone expects right now good things come in threes for Bitcoin Bitcoin on way to a monthly Bollinger band basis at around Thirty one thousand dollars is getting closer once regained expect some fireworks so you can see this red line on the Bollinger Bands when Bitcoin crosses it to the upside generally parabolic rally ensues afterwards we're getting pretty darn close Thirty one thousand dollars right now should we cross that that could be fireworks for Bitcoin we do have a true bottom forming on the hikish hiki hikingashi candles uh when it turns the first set of green candles during a bear Market that's a fake signal you can see the first greens here fake signals second greens true bottom historically for all those True Believers out there it looks like we may have the true Bottom already and that time is right now like we talked about time is running out to accumulate Bitcoin these signals obv is something that generally is a leading indicator for Bitcoin so this is a good one to keep an eye out for and the Chan momentum oscillator also gives us a good idea as to what's happening so number one we have the obv starting to tick back up same time we have a breakthrough of the Chan momentum oscillator breaking a previous downtrend now historically when both of these things have happened this has been the beginning of massive runs for Bitcoin so this time everything is lining up once again where we may see massive Bitcoin runs and this month is critical only a few hours left until the monthly closed so possibly by the time this episode airs it will have closed but a monthly close above the 10ma line has confirmed the start of a new bull market for Bitcoin in 2015 right here and 2019 right here I hope you know how important this is right now the candle is above that 10 m a on the monthly if we close above there that could be very very big for Bitcoin which brings us to the Chart the route to the halfing these are the cycles aligned by April 2021 all-time highs you can see we are right in the territory where the bottom is usually already in and just generally a slow uptick until after the halfing until the price really starts to go up so you know barring any unforeseen Mega craziness that you know could happen who knows what's going to happen in the world these days otherwise things are looking pretty good for Bitcoin""]"

price dipped a little bit lower the bond price dipped our yield would have been a bit higher we could have jumped in and bought then and ultimately our returns would have been better than the 10 because we would have paid a lower price and either way we know we're getting back the 100 at the end of the day so speaking specifically to people who are looking at or investors who are looking at their portfolio and saying hey I own these different Bond ETFs and I'm buying them for safety I'm buying them for security one thing you might consider doing is perhaps not owning the ETF itself perhaps tips the treasury inflation protected securities we talked about before are a great investment but there really only as good as we're willing to hold them to maturity if we have to buy a bond and we buy the bond ETF and then things don't go the way we expected from a macroeconomic standpoint that can hurt us but if we buy a five-year Bond or a two-year Bond or a 20-year Bond and we hold it to maturity assuming in this case the U.S government can pay us back at the end of the 20 years we know today exactly what those returns are going to be if they're enough for the safety part of our portfolio that we need that could be a very good move now for me I'm more focused on stocks and longer term investing I'm trying to get bigger returns than even what today's bonds are are paying us so for me I'm trying to focus on stocks with that in mind let me tell you real quick about a website that we're building where it will be different we're going to we're building a platform that allows us to Value companies quickly and easily now we've already built the discounted cash flow version of the platform and we're gradually going to introduce a bunch of different ways to Value different types of stocks different ways that are good for different companies based on their own economic profile based on their own financials so ideally we could punch in the ticker of a company like a Tesla and it will the website will kick back some of the best ways to value that stock what the fair value is using that valuation method guiding us as to whether or not we should consider investing in it or really consider researching it more or maybe a bank discounted cash flow doesn't work for a bank but it could work but Price to Book value press the tangible Book value these could be ways that work very very well companies like apple discount cash flow would be perfect for that it's a large Blue Chip company very reliable free cash flow that could be a great way discounted cash flow is a great way to do it that's already working we got the beta version of the website up now the advantage of signing up today before the the whole website is done being built is that we are locking in the price for anybody who signs up today"", ""in this video we're going to look at the basics of a bond what it is and how you can make money investing in it we're gonna look at two real-life examples one from Nike and one from Kroger a bond is a loan you make to the company let's look at some examples here are the details for a Nike bond and here are the details for a Kroger bond we're gonna keep this simple let's imagine you're going to invest $1,000 worth of each bond here's an overview of how a typical bond would work when a bond is first issued it has on it what is called par value or face value typically that's a hundred or thousand dollars so let's imagine you invest a thousand dollars on that day in return what you will receive is interest payments usually twice a year let's assume the coupon rate on that bond is 10 percent that would mean if you invest a thousand dollars you would receive $100 a year or $50 every six months that's typically the way it works twice a year you would receive this until the maturity date were on the maturity date in addition to your final interest payment you would receive back the par value of the bond in this case a thousand dollars so in looking at the Nike bond the three point eight 75% tells you that for the thousand dollars invested you would receive thirty eight dollars and seventy five cents for the kroger bond the seven point five percent coupon tells you would receive seventy-five dollars a year if you look at the price of each the Nike bond is trading at one hundred and two point four while the kroger bond is trading at one hundred and thirty point three why the difference people have flooded into the kroger bond that is paying seven and a half percent the more people that buy it the higher the price goes so what does this mean for you as an investor the hundred and thirty point three means it would cost you one thousand three hundred and three dollars for the same thousand dollars worth of a bond while the Nike bond will cost you one thousand twenty four dollars the advantage of buying the kroger is if you pay thirteen hundred and three dollars you will receive 75 dollars a year versus the thousand twenty four dollars for Nike we are only going to receive thirty eight seventy five a year no matter what the price you pay you're going to receive the interest payments based on the par value of the bond and at the end of the bond when the bond matures you're going to receive back that par value also known as the face value that's the purpose of investing in bonds it's steady it's consistent and in theory it's safer than stocks if you have any questions about the world of investing any suggestions on videos please post in the comments below and please subscribe as we continue to update with new videos every week thank you"", ""well we got a comment where somebody had put up where they explained that they invested in treasury ETFs so uh tip CTS which is treasury inflation protected securities tips for short now there's a tips ETF that is the I shares tips ETF and basically the higher inflation goes the more yield we get the better the dividends we get in that particular ETF given how high inflation has been and given how bad the stock market has been well you would think that the bond market would be a good place to invest the issue the real issue is that Bond ETFs are different so let's jump into why so this is a chart of the returns of that very same tips ETF so each bar represents a single month and it's looking back over the past five or six years and basically what it's doing is if the bar is green this that ETF was up in that given month if the bar is read the ETF was down in that given month over this entire time period Well the total return was about up 8.4 percent when if we annualize those numbers that means we returned about 1.3 percent per year which is logical given where interest rates have been and what we would expect to return from a government treasury investment we would expect it to be low but we would expect it to be safe over that entire time period that made a lot of sense but now what would happen if we were to Overlay interest rates on top of this chart so this orange line is the Fed funds rate that is the interest rate that the Federal Reserve sets the target interest rate on an overnight basis and basically when you hear Hey the Federal Reserve increased interest rates by 75 basis points this is the interest rate that they're talking about but before we go any further there's one important point that is going to make all of this come together if we are either already invested in a bond ETF or if we're thinking about investing in Bonds in general and that is how bonds are tied to yields so we can see that the yield the orange line is the yield the interest rate that is being that is being paid out by the government so the if the price of a bond goes up the yield goes down always that's the way it works assuming the yield stays the same assuming the interest payment stays the same and in bonds they do if the yield go if the price goes down the yield goes up the two act inversely so they're it's sort of like a seesaw effect now that's very important because if you were to buy a bond and interest rates after you bought the bond go higher well people are probably going to sell the bond that you have driving the price down and they're going to buy the bond with the higher yield so your price goes down because that's the bond we owe people are selling that more sellers the price goes down""]"

information that would ensure the companies were legit HSBC processed 31 billion dollars that were stolen from the Brazil government and 292 million dollars for an organization based in Panama that we

failing to stop its money laundering in 2021 and now onto some Financial crimes committed by good old American companies he didn't think we were going to point the finger at foreigners did you"", ""yeah JP Morgan djp Morgan the guy who started the world's most criminal Bank bank and several other major bankers at the time who loaned the US government 23 million dollars to get the New York Stock Exchange back to work soon after a national monetary commission was actually founded to lay the blueprint for the Federal Reserve Act back in 1913 that was the beginning of the end for the dollar this is the year that money changed Forever This gave complete monetary control of the US dollar to a board room full of bankers and it removed it from the control of the U.S treasury bad idea with decisions then being made at the FED not requiring any approval from a government or from a president the FED thus is tasked with protecting the entire financial banking system or more adequately put manipulating that system it's pretty easy to do when you have an unlimited supply of money right the federal reserve prints every single Dollar in existence they create economic instability by over printing money they create the booms and the busts then the banks of course will come out commercial Banks Mountain Lobby the government to print more money to bail them out when things go wrong it's the largest financial scam in history perpetrated against humans of this planet stealing the value of the nation with each dollar printed and it's no secret that the Federal Reserve has failed or perhaps from their view succeeded perfectly in robbing the world with a hundred years of data clearly showing the failure of this system in the Federal Reserve balance sheet it just keeps going up with no stop will disposable income for regular people keeps falling next we need to talk about the international arm of the criminal banking Syndicate working with the Federal Reserve to control monetary policy and enslave countries to debt slavery and that's the IMF the international monetary fund of the IMF is made up of top officials from each country's Central Bank or finance ministry this is where all the banks in the world's get together to discuss how they will remain in control of the money supply the IMF has made a reputation for itself as a predatory loan agency that basically lends money out to in debt countries to globalist Banks while also putting in all these Clauses with those loans that strip a country of its natural and public resources then of course we have the world economic Forum"", ""and then there is the Bank of international settlements which was founded back in 1930 by the creators of the Federal Reserve this was done to ensure that their reign and their control of monetary policy globally was persistent across the world and as the name implies the bis Bank of international settlements it's the central bank for central banks decisions made at the IMF the ECB the fed the WF the Boe they all run through the bank of international settlements this is the banks piggy bank where huge amounts of wealth and power are being funneled to the wealthiest people on this planet this is the agency where shadowy banking families and shadowy banking cartels remain in control of the world's money safely managing foreign exchange reserves from their Tower up on high this is the banking institution's biggest proponent by the way as well of the implementation of Central Bank digital currencies the newest and greatest Financial threat to humanity which is being cooked up by globalists and we fully programmable digital money with scary implications the outline is clear create more and more debt so the banking cartels can print more and more money this is all part of how fractional Reserve banking works is how this Fiat system works one of the most valuable Tools in A bank's Arsenal is his ability to steal money from a nation without that Nation even knowing that's inflation that's debt and it's done by compounding debt on top of debt on top of debt most economies are ruled by debt since all the money of course is being printed out of thin air the debt ends up being more just numbers on paper than actual physical ownership of tangible goods or services and then of course the fractional Reserve banking system means that only some of the money that exists in all all of the bank accounts is actually backed by physical cash that can actually be withdrawn something like a measly 10 percent in the USA thus Banks take the other 90 of your money and lend it out to anyone that they deem worthy meaning that every dollar in your bank account is not actually your money it becomes the bank's money of course it's all the bank's money anyway at the end of the day isn't it the Fiat system is a scam it's a fugazi it's a system designed to enslave everyone via debt and to impoverish everyone via inflation and all the while this criminal banking cartel manipulates the supply of money to their advantage massively enriching themselves and impoverishing everyone else Fiat money only has value because we give it value it's actually backed by nothing most people don't even realize this there's no gold backing up the dollar there's no resources backing up the dollar just a trust me bro from the government it's insanity but this era of USD Fiat dominance could be coming to an end and when it does we probably have just three choices of what comes next the first first is cbdc Central Bank digital currencies such a truly orwellian evolution of modern Fiat and criminal banking practices combined with technological totalitarianism option two the bricks money this is a proposal by the brics group Brazil Russia India China South Africa other members coming on board basically to have a commodity-backed currency backed by things like gold silver oil as well as potentially member State Fiat kind of ish a return to hard money if you will that would be a bit of a shock to the financial system if it actually grows into a global status remains to be seen but still government issued money an option three of course Bitcoin Bitcoin is the only currency of freedom in the world right now it's the only free market economic money all the other options are just extensions of failed Central banking system policies all benefits the banks we deserve a free currency not a currency controlled by monetary mechanisms that are used as Financial weapons Bitcoin is the only truly free money in the world it's free from the banking cartels the influence of them they can't manipulate it""]"

And as discussed earlier, this can rapidly increase your portfolio profits if used correctly. Hey guys, there are some competitors out there that you can also try. Bybit is right now giving $30,000 bonus if you use my link down below. You can also use my link to Bitget down below: $8,000. And you can also use my BitFlix link $2,000 below this video. All exchanges, great exchanges. Very good competitors to Binance. Now, if you still choose to go with Binance because you're watching this video so it makes sense that I keep explaining how to use Binance. We can talk about perpetual vs. delivery contracts. So before we dive straight into the Binance Futures trading platform, you need to understand the difference between perpetual contracts and delivery contracts."", ""is that the more trading Revenue that g-trade generates the more people that are trading on the network and we've seen this is increased it has increased over time significantly the more that stakers of GNX earn and that um is a pretty linear but also a pretty effective way in my opinion of paying yield to stake because we can see see the gns pool here which is on polygon and also arbitrim now which they are launching on very very soon the gns dipole is essentially a liquidity pool where you provide liquidity to also earn rewards so it pays out on positive trades and receives trading losses so obviously if you're betting on the dipole you're betting on Traders over time losing money and the protocol making money um and the protocol having a house Edge which in general most exchanges do because most people actually lose in trading that's just kind of how trading goes and the exchanges are obviously the beneficiaries of this Dynamic and that's why um they kind of see the house always wins in this case gns is the house and if your staking die you're getting exposure to the essential losses of Traders which over time have been growing and growing as the platform gains in traction the gns token has been deflationary since its Inception stakers are not being paid with newly minted token liquidity"", ""and you can trade short you can also trade a variety of assets I'll show you an example on ethereum that's another pair that you can trade you can also trade stocks you can trade some Forex as well so there's many options to trade so let's say I want to sit um set a limit order on ethereum I can do the exact same thing of course now I only have one die in my wallet because I have a pending transaction but if you had available funds you can of course set the leverage here um and open uh limit order on ethereum either short or long and there's many other assets I think that's one of the major draw cards of games it's that you have many other assets to take advantage on so overall pretty clean pretty easy user experience when it comes to opening trades and that's why I like it and of course it will be on arbitrim soon so you'll have polygon and arbitrim that you can trade on remember if you do want to trade on games Network there is a link in the description of course use the link in the description if you want to do any trading and I'm going to try and get a giveaway sort of for you guys that actually sign up you just simply click on my referral link it is the first link in the description and you can start trading on G trade right here let's get into the Vault side of things because not all of you are Traders now of course one of the ways to capture exposure to games without trading yourself is actually via providing liquidity one of the ways to do this is via staking die in the G vault which is currently paying a 4.1 apy and is also now launched on arbitrum so you can do so on arbitrim or polygon as gains starts to roll out onto the arbitrant network as well if you stake die you are essentially representing your ownership in the vault so stakers of dire receive fees for each trade placed on the platform in exchange for serving as the counterparty to all trades obviously to power trades on the network they need liquidity so if you provide liquidity the people that are trading on the other side are using your liquidity to essentially be paid out and processed transactions if the Traders lose money the people that are staking to the Vault the liquidity providers they earn more if the Traders make money then the gdivault becomes less profitable but the theory is here that Traders actually aren't profitable and because the house always wins over time the stakers in the G diver will make more money as more people use the platform and there's more fees now of course there are risks where it comes when it comes to oracle-based dexes um and one of one of the major risks is that some kind of expert Point um or profitable trading strategy which wipes the pool be aware of that risk I'm just showing you guys the platform and giving you the option to stake if you are bullish on games and if you choose to do so I'm not necessarily saying that you have to of course you can just trade on the platform like everyone else but if you wanted to take it a step further and you like the platform and you're bullish on the platform then one way to capture exposure is through the G dive Vault the other way to capture exposure is of course through the gns pool which pays out to stakers based on how much fees the platform is earning and if we look at June analytics we can see that daily trade volume has been steadily increasing over time as well as users and obviously fees are represented in die have also increased despite dropping from last year but considering it's a bear Market this has been a pretty solid performance for gains Network and I think it's just off the back of having like a very usable product and I think it's launch on arbitrim that can also be a potential Catalyst to get more users into the platform and I think it holds it in much better stead uh long term being on arbitrim as well so of course if you do want to uh want to purchase DNS and stake it and capture upside to that then you can do so under their staking um section here you can buy gns if you click this button it will take you to Quick swap to buy gns you can approve it and then stake it as well and if you want to bridge funds across from polygon to arbitrim to stake on arbitrim they've got a bridge if you click on the bridge tab here which allows you to bridge assets across once again I want to make it clear that I'm not paid to promote the gns token or the staking my primary goal here is to show you guys how to use the platform but obviously part of that is showing you how to use the staking functions as well""]"

""hi folks dave waring here again with inform trades dot-com and today's lesson of the day in today's lesson i'm going to share with you the three things I learned from the I know TV video trading seminar by Larry Williams the secrets of short term trading if you've not checked out I know TV already I highly recommend doing so as you get access to over 500 video and audio trading seminars which would cost thousands of dollars to attend in person for the one look price of one hundred dollars per year if you're interested in learning more I've included some links below this video on inform trades where you can do so as well as where you can sign up to receive four free video training seminars so let's get started for anyone who is not familiar with Larry Williams he is probably most famous for the Williams percent are and ultimate oscillator indicators which he developed as well as for winning the world cup of futures trading by turning $10,000 into over 1 million dollars during the twelve-month contest this specific seminar was on short-term trading techniques for trading the S&P futures market and the 90-minute video was packed with tons of trading strategies and tips although although he does not go deeply into the relationship during the seminar he mentions with all of his trades that he watches the bond market so it is important for traders of the ESPY futures and the stock market in general to understand that there was a relationship there that should be paid attention to in short SMP traders watched the bond market because sound stock market rally should generally be accompanied by sell-off in the bond market and vice-versa this is because them as the market continues to move up we should see large institutions begin to shift money out of bonds and into the stock market which means that bond yields have to go up to attract additional money as bond yields and bond prices moving up in the opposite direction the rise in yields which should a general which should generally accompany a rally in the stock market is going to result in a sell-off in the price of bonds for more information on this I've included some free links below this video on inform trades the second point that he makes is that he has done much study on cycles and found that the one true cycle of the stock market is that it moves from periods of large ranges to small ranges across pretty much every timeframe he goes into several characteristics of this movement between small ranges to big ranges the most important of which is that because small ranges are followed by large ranges you want to be getting into the market when ranges are small and getting out of the market or staying on the sidelines sidelines when ranges are big other points he makes about that his observation of ranges are more times than not large range days to the upside will close at or near their highs and large range days to the downside will close at or near their lows large range days do not normally work both sides of the open trading down big before turning around and trading up big or vice-versa large range days generally open and head in the direction where they're going pretty much from the open at market highs we normally close right on the day's high and at market lows we normally close right at the day's lows so where the market is closing in relation to the range can give you an indication of where you are in the cycle he has built a market sentiment indicator based on this which he shows you how to construct in a seminar in the interest of time however I'm going to finish up by covering a simple trading method he refers to as the oobs method for taking advantage of this he believes it is normally better to be a buyer on Monday and a seller on Fridays so he recommends using this tea technique on Monday if you're buying and on Fridays if you are selling here the two very basic criteria for the trade number one if you're buying on Monday then bonds need to be trending lower and if you're selling on Friday then bonds need to be trending higher number two when the market opens lower than the previous day's low and then rallies up to the previous day's low on Monday he is a buyer when the market opens higher than the previous day's high and then sells off to the previous day's high on Fridays he is a seller so that is a very basic entry technique that can be combined with some of the other methods that we're learning and test it out with some paper S&P trades keep in mind that this is just an entry technique so traders will need to develop their trade management criteria for use in the real-time trade which you can find ideas for in the free inform trades basics of trading video course that's a lesson for today as I continue through the I know TV video trading seminars and come across things that I think the community will benefit from I'll share them here""]"
54,53,46,53_level_zone_resistance_pair,"['level', 'zone', 'resistance', 'pair', 'euro', 'area', 'resistance level', 'dollar', 'possible', 'structure']","[""so we have another major level of structure that is formed the reason is because we have one to three times the market has used this level as support and resistance now this market broke into new highs hold back directly to that level we're currently just hovering around this level at one of six point eight two but we will be looking on lower timeframes for possible entry reasons for that trading plan to come together on this dollar yen pair and give us a push up because we are expecting this push up to come in to the 108 area right here at this previous major resistance combining that with these previous major support levels so that's alright traders so this market was hovering somewhere around the 106.8 level last week and as you can see we had a pretty nice rally out of this market we ended up pushing up directly into this previous level of structural resistance that we were talking about becoming possible support so another instance where predicting market moves in this very simple way has paid off pretty well and let's go ahead and talk about what we're expecting in the future here out of this pair well since we have created this double top situation here on the dollar yen we're not really looking for a trade at the moment what we'll wait on is to see if this market get back down into the 106.8 level once more give us a possible long trade or if we see this market ahead higher we're looking at the same level as a possible counter trend move to the downside here on this pair and those are the two predictions we're looking at here on the dollar yen we'll go ahead move on to our next pair now which will be the pound dollar on the pound dollar last week we had a prediction that this market would come into our level around one point four to five between that and this wig right up here that you can see looking left and give us some type of entry reason to push the market lower we got into that zone that's what we've had so far here out of the pound dollar but what are we expecting next out of this pair well since this market has just come up high into this resistance looking left"", ""and so does the body of this previous resistance here these candles right here so with that being the case right in this area if we can get a move up and then I move back down into this little bazan we just drew near 1.7 4-4-2 if we get a pullback into that zone it's going to be a great place for us to start looking for Tran continuation opportunities here on the euro New Zealand now a cool part of this we're on the daily chart now delete our drawings again we're gonna drop down to a smaller time frame this is our whole technical analysis approach given to you guys so here we are and what if on this time frame probably not gonna happen here let's go ahead and go down to another time frame what if only one hour time frame here we go so something we can throw in here we're doing technical analysis we can use indicators structure and trend we've already talked about trend and structure we're definitely in an uptrend here only you're in New Zealand as of recently because we just broke out of that period of consolidation on the daily chart and four hour and one our charts are both in uptrend now also we know that this is our most previous level of structural resistance that's been broken makes it a highly likely place to find some kind of support out of this market now what if we start throwing in indicators what if we wait to see if this market gets down to our around one point force probably one point seven for one point seven four five sorry about that guys and up to this black line in that zone what if we wait for the market to get down into that area and when it does get into this area this market becomes oversold and then we find an entry reason based on an oversold over bolt strategy do you guys see the power of doing all this technical analysis before you place a trade based on a strategy you've tested if you've tested oversold markets and then some type of entry reason based on a candlestick pattern or something else in an oversold market and it's proven to be profitable over time doing this technical analysis ahead of time can significantly increase your chances of being right or being correct on that specific trade now beyond that guys this is not something you need to go out and just start doing you have to test for this you have to test and see well what is my likelihood of winning when I placed this trade based on the strategy I've created let's say with RSI being oversold or overbought at levels of structure there's a way to test that guys you can test it using swapping back and forth between daily and four-hour in one-hour charts maybe having all three of them on the screen at the same time I know it's hard work and it sounds like a lot of time you're gonna have spend doing it and that's true but it is completely and utterly necessary for you to do that those are the secrets that we use each and every time we place a trade if you guys are interested in being notified about the advanced pattern mastery course the links in the description if you wanna get your hands on the free three-part training series we use when we trade reversals then we have that available for about 24 more hours guys that's gonna be going very very soon we're going to include it in the EAP training program I just want to offer to you guys for free for a little bit of time we've had that out and free for a little over a month now so you should have been able to get your hands on it if you haven't we're gonna leave it open for about 24 hours and it's in the description as well and guys finally if you're ready to take your trading to the next level and discover some more advanced techniques and trading entries that we use here at the trading

profitable traders we are attempting to create over the next 12 months and you're ready to put forth the effort that it's going to take to become profitable which is a massive amount of effort we're ready to follow instructions and be disciplined then that link in the description is labeled EAP training program and I'm excited to work with you other than that guys I hope you have a great rest of your day I hope you found this content to be valuable click Subscribe if you're not quite subscribed yet the like button pull me before you go and I'll talk to you guys in the next video"", ""well next we went down to a smaller time frame which in our case was the 4-hour chart we'll take it down to that chart now and on this 4-hour chart we noticed that we had this breakout situation we noticed that this market after breaking resistance on the daily chart was coiling right here finding support at the same exact spot with smaller resistance levels but for us a period of consolidation whether it's a descending or a singing triangle is going to follow the trend of the market so since we had already decided we had a long bias although this is referred to as a descending triangle meaning we have lower resistance levels that's not we weren't looking for a short trade we were not looking for a short trade because we were in an uptrend so while in an uptrend we look for those periods of consolidation to breakout in the direction of the underlying trend so that's what we're looking for here on the euro New Zealand and that's exactly what we got we got that breakout after a breakout what tends to happen to markets is that they pull back somewhere near the most previous resistance levels and then they move higher they create trend continuation so after this breakout as you can see what we've pointed out now is the resistance level that was just broken right here the other level we pointed out is this resistance level inside of the period consolidation that was tested three times and the bottom level we pointed out was a resistance level inside the consolidation area that had also been tested multiple times and acted as resistance those three levels is where we were looking for possible trading opportunities so now we're two or three steps in technical analysis deep we took a look at trend on the daily chart we made sure we had room to the upside for targets and now we've looked at these previous levels of structure after a consolidation breakout pattern which we know tends to lead towards having another move up having a Trank attenuation play which is what we're expecting on the euro New Zealand and exactly we got now for us specifically we used this level of resistance we waited for the market to get down into that level and we have a specific entry reason on a lower timeframe to get involved right here around the one o'clock close candle now with that being the case we opened that position and this is where the real secrets come in guys so far we've talked about technical analysis technical analysis extremely important in trading you need to be a master of technical analysis to be consistently profitable but what's harder to learn than technical analysis discipline it's much harder to figure these secrets out the discipline of creating a trading plan everything other than technical analysis is a lot harder to learn than technical analysis is and in this case we needed a massive amount of that discipline the reason is because we had a market that was pushing down we entered our position here it pushed down even further as soon as we entered we got a little bounce up""]"

and twenty eight billion market cap Bitcoin dominance still still still very high at 55 percent you don't need no fork rumors to stay high now apparently honestly the fork stuff did wonders wonders for Bitcoin until you kind of think about if that market cap wasn't there and it was there although it doesn't necessarily work like that besides market of choice is a good thing the good old altcoin daily thread lots and lots of discussion lots of coins lots of the same ones that keep getting mentioned req modem what else link rd n wall term substratum this guy's talking about links it's literally a 1 million dollar market cap coin very risky people talking about it and then you've got people selling telling not selling telling in four months I went from having five ether to now only 1.3 from basically making bad trades and this is kind of concerning it's a little bit hard for me to talk about this because some if not most of the trades I've ever made did well and especially the icy OS that I went forwards it very well and I don't know there's probably"", ""so after we reached the peak euphoria after Bitcoin has gone up and had a slight correction but then all coins provide an even better opportunity they're going up five ten times in some cases the punchbowl is completely full our ones having a party to having a great time and they think nothing's gonna go wrong investors traders and speculators take profits the institution's the smart people that usually the people who are playing with bigger money and understand human psychology when everything is going good they start to lock in profits they get to sell things at the relative top and because of that you are going to see a decline not only continued in Bitcoin but also in other cryptocurrencies and I don't need to even need to bring up the charts you guys have seen it for yourself in this market there has been a serious decline in all coin valuations because people locked in profits they took intact Bitcoin and some of them have cashed out but some I've just been holding it in Bitcoin as well and Bitcoin has obviously been trading at lower prices so this is really what we saw in 2017 and into the Lindt the early part of 2018 it's very common to understand this guys there is a period of exuberance and then exuberance can make of all the difference in just a few days this is how market cycles work going back to that chart we have periods of happiness of excitement and then also the periods of denial and this is how they apply in crypto we usually see a period where new money enters into the market the entry of liquidity and this is going to come in different shapes and sizes over time so what we saw going back to this real quick I just want to go over and just kind of recap on these and the entry of liquidity over this past year we had a lot of new money enter into the market and this was through retail investors through hedge funds through venture capital funds that overnight had turned into crypto funds and what really caused this what sparked this what was the catalyst that we talked about here that really brought this to reality well if we turn back to my drawings here I'm going to go ahead and show you guys a very important trend that we saw going over a three more than three year period which was the cup and handle that Bitcoin had from its peak in 2013 all the way over here to march of 2017 this is a very common technical pattern on for a bullish uptrend for the long term for serious outbreaks and the fact that it had been building up for three years and the news of the technology started getting up people started talking about Bitcoin again and people started understanding the potential what blockchain could do you had a massive massive rally in regards to the price of Bitcoin another crypto currencies so sometimes it's a technical catalyst and sometimes it's a fundamental calais something new is coming up something exciting for Bitcoin could serve as a new entry point for money and what can that be for next the next market cycle could be for the next periodic Rotom because if we take a step back here we've gone through all these three major steps we've had the period where people take profits we had all the periods of entry liquidity as well as Bitcoin stagnating and all coins going up what could be the next catalyst that makes Bitcoin for example go from $11,000 where it's at now all the way up to 40 50 thousand maybe even a hundred thousand one day well maybe it might be the introduction of a Bitcoin ETF now for those of you who don't know Bitcoin a Bitcoin ETF or an exchange-traded fund for the acronym of ETF would be an opportunity for institutions to give peace of investing in Bitcoin many of them from investment banks people who play with hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars in total they can't invest in Bitcoin because it's not in the shape of a financial instrument they're allowed to trade or speculate on and with a Bitcoin ETF this would open up the floodgates for companies like JP Morgan Goldman Sachs all these investment banks to get a stake in Bitcoin and the buying side action couldn't be massive so you don't see that there's a lot of attempts of this direct see on a granite shares first cost the first trust ETF as well as well as Vanek and all these different companies even the Winklevoss twins who were you know suppose a debating over the founding of Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg they've gone out trying to create these Bitcoin ETS I can tell you all that they're going to probably be created this year which could serve as the catalyst for this next run up so again we look for catalyst ahead of time guys that's one of the kind of tips I'm going to give you here in just a second but we look for that entry of liquidity and once we have that we know that ok we've started into the market cycle let's go ahead and you know bet on Bitcoin for the short term but we have to prepare for the fact that bitcoin eventually will stagnate in most cases and that the money will flow into more high-risk plays such as all coins and then eventually after that we have to come up with a game plan a strategy once we've entered into that part into taking profits not getting too greedy and not getting caught up in the emotions so this is generally how market cycles work notice how I didn't do any crazy ta outside of the cup and handle guys sometimes they don't need to do ta sometimes it's strictly on fundamentals but applying simple principles like buying low and selling high and things like that can be very helpful and here are some key steps that I really want to kind of drill in that I've talked about in the video"", ""but I'm back on the streets there'll be trouble when they see me big win surpasses 50% dominance and rapidly growing this is now the highest point bitcoins been in dominance for 2018 now I wouldn't say that actually means too much I think we'd all take a 30% dominance again and have closer to 1 trillion market cap like we were just about to peek at in January with 30% dominance and that much of a market cap we'd be back at a 20k Bitcoin as it is Bitcoin is just gobbling up dominance because it's falling slower than most other coins really really obvious today you know you have Bitcoin at 5% but aetherium almost three times more losses today and that's not uncommon with the current market cap valuation we are back to November 2017 mid November as far as market cap went then things went parabolic after that but we've we've returned now to sanity I suppose does this mean it's a good time to buy alts might on accredited financial advice would be it depends if we knew that this was the bottom yeah""]"

Alright, No. 2, another regret that people have: not resolving a family squabble. Some of the unhappiest people in their old age, researchers said, were those that had a rift with a family member like a child or sibling or a parent and never reconciled. That's sad. Brokamp: Very sad. Southwick: No. 3: putting off saying how you feel. Apparently, not expressing love frequently enough was a common regret of older men. Brokamp: Aww. I wonder if that's a generational thing. I feel like the today's man is a little more sensitive. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. Southwick: I don't know. Rick Engdahl: I love you guys! Southwick: Thank you! Brokamp: I love you guys, too! And you too, listeners! Southwick: I think you guys are pretty OK. Alright, No. 4: not traveling enough. Some people chose to wait until retirement to travel. But the researchers said that putting it off means that your health could have already started failing before you've had a chance to do your lifelong dream of a trip to Italy or whatever."", ""I feel like you've mentioned the Legacy Project on the podcast before. Brokamp: It sounds familiar. Southwick: It's led by some researchers out of Cornell. Basically, they gathered responses from 1,500 people over the age of 65 about all kinds of things, including their most common regrets in life. Here are, in no particular order, the eight most common regrets that the wise elder people in our life have. Ready? Brokamp: Ready! Southwick: Alright. No. 1: Not being careful enough when choosing a life partner. Brokamp: Oh, yeah, sure. [laughs] Southwick: Hopefully, this is getting better as a society. Hopefully, young men and women feel like they have more options and that your 20s aren't just a big game of musical chairs where you have to choose the closest one when the music stops.

growth over the long run how have these indices performed the performance from january 1st of 1979 through july 31st of 2020 of the russell 1000 index the russell 1000 growth index and the russell 1000 value index highlight that value has actually lost to growth over this entire time sample so as a value investor that is a disappointment to say the least and digging deeper let's look at the performance over the past 10 years the market or the russell 1000 returned 13.85 percent whereas russell 1000 value returned 10 and russell 1000 growth returned 17 and almost 7 differential between value and growth over the 10 years ending july 31st of 2020 and when we look at that on a compounded growth chart the returns are very painful examine in the past one three and five years we see that value has lost to growth by 35 over the past one year through july 31st 2020 by almost 18 percent compounded for three years and by almost 11 compounded for the previous five years and so in a lot of people's minds value investing is dead but let's take a step back for a moment what exactly is value investing it is simply trying to buy stocks that are cheaper when compared to other stocks but now what does it mean for a stock to be cheap let's look at a simple example pretend that there are only four stocks in the universe in which we can invest we are going to simply look at the firm's earnings each year and compare that to the price one would pay if they bought the entire company such as like the firm's market cap this is called the simple price to earnings or p e ratio so in my four stock example i have four stocks that all have a market cap of one thousand however stock one has earnings of a hundred stock two has earnings of fifty stock three has an earnings of twenty five dollars and stock four has an earnings of ten so the price to earnings ratio on stock one which has an earnings of 100 and a market cap of a thousand is 10."", ""so part of this is the construction process that they use here are the three variables that are used to create the russell 1000 growth and value indices the first is book to market the second is medium-term forecast earnings growth rate based on the ibis two-year forecast ibis or analysts the third measure is sales per share growth rate based on five year historical sales now without making any judgments as to whether or not this is a good or bad process what one should note is that this methodology is definitely different than the simple example above which was simply splitting the firms on the pe multiple or like in the original value papers book to market or our preferred measure ebit to tv so what would happen if we went back and tested splitting the 1000 largest firms on a simple pe multiple over the same time period to answer that i dug into the data i annually rebalanced the portfolios on june 30th of each year using the firm's market cap to identify the 1 000 largest firms firms earnings values were brought in as of 630 each year using annual data while only examining data as of 331 each year this is done to eliminate the so-called look-ahead bias that can occur when looking at back tests so all the portfolios shown in the main text are market cap weighting or evaluating in the academic parlance so the first thing i did was ensure that my universe of the 1000 largest firms reasonably matched the returns to the russell 1000 index so over the january 1st 1979 to december 31st"", ""whereas stock 4 which has earnings of 10 and market cap of 1 000 has a pe or price to earnings ratio of a hundred so in my four stock example stocks one and two traded a lower multiple of earnings relative to three and four so a systematic value investor who only uses pe multiple would prefer stocks one and two compared to three and four as a shopping example stocks one and two were on sale compared to stocks three and four because all four firms had the exact same market cap but firms one and two make more money so they are value or cheap stocks of course my example above is very simplified and we are only looking at one point in time number past year's earnings it may be the case that firms train for growing at a faster rate and we can create more advanced models to try to figure out the best investment however if that were the case an expert can create better models then active managers wouldn't lose to the market around eighty percent of the time over five years according to spiva studies so academics have studied how value stocks perform relative to growth stocks in general they use the book value of assets divided by the market cap of the firm as this was the measure used in the seminal 1992 and 1993 family and french papers and what they found is that value stocks outperform gross stocks so in the original paper falm and french highlight that this is most likely compensation on for taking on some additional risk really to underscore the fact that this is not a free lunch of course one can use other measures to identify cheap stocks such as price to earnings or book to market we examined different methods in a paper that wes and i wrote a couple years ago looking at also free cash flow and ebit to tev however the big picture takeaway is the following value beat growth no matter which metric one used so back to our russell 1000 example why then does the russell 1000 indices have growth beating value over a pretty substantial time period 1979 to july of 2020.""]"

Now, in addition, on the right, these are the different features or things that you can do with OneGold. First of all, you can buy or sell. You can deposit funds from the bank. You can withdraw back, you know, out and put your money back into the bank. You can also redeem and take physical possession of your metals. And you can also set up an auto-invest strategy if you wanna invest automatically in any of these precious metals on a set recurring schedule. Moving on, let's now talk about the features of OneGold. Well, first of all, in terms of the assets, you're able to trade gold, silver, and platinum."", ""Lastly, one of my favorite parts about using OneGold is that you can request redemption for physical metals right within the app. So if you're using the vaulted storage and then down the road for whatever reason, you wanna get your physical metal in possession, right within the app, you can request physical metal redemption. Now, as I mentioned here, guys, one of my favorite parts about the OneGold app is being able to track precious metal prices, and these screenshots here are as of January 27th, 2022. So what we're looking at here are the prices of gold here in the last 24 hours, in the middle here is the one-year price chart on silver, and on the right is the five-year price chart on platinum. And visually, I just find the app to be very easy to navigate. We're gonna be checking it out a little bit here shortly. But just to show you some screenshots here of the charting, it is a really solid place to track prices of precious metals. Now, beyond just tracking prices, you're also able to manage your portfolio."", ""Now, when you're looking at vaults which is where most people are going to store their gold rather than redeeming it for physical, you actually get to choose your own vault when you invest with OneGold, and, of course, you can redeem for physical metal within the app at any point in time. Now, in terms of track record here or legitimacy, well, APMEX has been around for over 20 years, and we know that this company here is fully insured and audited, and they don't do any mixing here of company assets and customer assets. Customer gold is never going to be seen on OneGold's Balance Sheet. Now, in terms of payment methods, you can actually pay with a ACH bank transfer, a wired transfer, and you can also use cryptocurrency to purchase precious metals using the OneGold app. In terms of the data, they offer a news feed which is gonna cover any key news related to the major precious metals out there in addition to live spot prices.

61,60,42,60_compound interest_compound_interest_72,"['compound interest', 'compound', 'interest', '72', 'earn', 'double money', 'double', 'earning', 'compounding', 'calculator']","[""you're ready to go put your money in the bank and let it grow well the average interest rate from a bank account is 0.05 percent and most cds are under one percent so start putting that into your rule of 72 do 72 divided by one it's going to take 72 years to double your money at one percent interest rate do it with a 0.05 interest rate that's going to tell you how long it's going to take double your money it's not going to happen you're not going to see these explosive returns unless you're planning on you know living to be five or six hundred years old then maybe you can you know do this through your bank account so the bank is not a practical place to earn compound interest but it is a place that you do earn compound interest so i wanted to explain that so then we have bonds now do remember that most bonds pay a fixed interest sum or simple interest on the principal so if you're earning simple interest you're not obviously getting compound interest but a zero coupon bond allows you to earn compound interest so these bonds pay a certain amount of money at the maturity date and do not pay you interest in the mean time so essentially the bond is purchased for less than the face value and is worth the face value at maturity so one way you can earn compound interest is through zero coupon bonds but again you're gonna find the yields are relatively low on those bonds because as we've said before bonds are a much more safe and conservative investment"", ""so how do you earn compound interest there's a couple of different ways you can do it some of them are really good and some of them are pretty lousy first of all one way you can earn compound interest is through your bank account through a savings account through a checking account through a money market account or through a certificate of deposit now is this a good way to earn compound interest absolutely not you're actually not even going to be outpacing inflation when you're earning compound interest through a bank account so I would not recommend doing this with your money don't put your money in the bank and think you're gonna become a millionaire through the interest earned from your checking account and if you guys don't believe me go out there and ask a millionaire how much money they made from their bank account and they're gonna tell you that they invested their money in the stock market or real estate or something else they didn't just put their money in the bank save their money let it sit there and build up a million dollar net worth so the best way to visualize these interest rates is to figure out how long it would take your money to double given that interest rate and you can calculate this very easily by looking at something called the rule of 72 and what that means is if you take the number 72 and divide it by your interest rate from whatever the investment is that's going to tell you how many years it's going to take to double your money at that given interest rate so take the bank account for example the average checking or savings account pays about a 0.05 percent interest rate so take 72 divided by 0.05 and you will find it's gonna take 1440 years to double your money so if you have $10,000 in your checking account it's gonna take you over 1,400 years for that to grow into $20,000 so that is a very lousy investment option moving on how about a money market a money market has a slightly higher interest rate and the average is around a 0.1% well not a 0.1 percent it's going to take you seven hundred twenty years to double your money so that is still a very lousy investment option and that's not an interest rate that most people would be happy with so moving on then how about a CD a certificate of deposit a short-term CD might yield about a 1% interest rate and that means that you will double your money in 72 years so if you invested $10,000 as a 20 year old and interest rates did not change by the time you are 92 years old you would have $20,000 now yes you could have a long-term CD at that point"", ""so that's not really a fair analysis but all I'm getting at is that the bank is not the best place to earn compound interest you can earn compound interest through a bank account or through investments from your bank but this is not the way that most people are doing it now the second way you can earn compound interest is through the stock market and this is the best way to earn compound interest and that is because the stock market on average pays about 8 to 10 percent per year and that is a compounded return so following the rule of 72 here if you take 72 divided by your 8% return that means that you can double your money with the stock market about every 9 years and as a young person you will be able to experience more doubling cycles of your money than somebody who is much older so a 20 year old who starts investing their money is going to experience more doubling cycles than a 50 year old who begins investing their money and that right there is that time value of compound interest we were talking about the more time you allow your money to grow the more doubling cycles you'll experience and the more your money is going to grow over time and then another way that you can earn compound interest through the stock market is through dividend payments by reinvesting those dividends when you're paid dividends from a stock you can either take that dividend in cash or you can reinvest that dividend back into the issuing stock and if you reinvest those dividends back into the issuing stock you're earning dividends on dividends also known as compound interest so that is another way that you can earn compound interest for the stock market is through those dividend payments so on average a dividend stock will pay around a 3% dividend and just with that dividend alone you'll double your money every 24 years by investing those dividends and the great part of this is you can earn compound interest through asset appreciation as well as dividend reinvestment""]"

That leaves us with the potential market for BYND of about eight hundred and twenty five billion dollars."", ""so how this company is staying in business is it is selling off its Investments to raise money and keep the lights on and we can see right here that the net cash provided by investing activities was 60 million dollars of this year and 317 Million last year so again that is how how the company is staying in business is slowly selling off its Investments and its Assets Now at the bottom of the cash flow statement here we can see that the net decrease in cash this year was 55 million dollars whereas last year it was 236 million so now if we go to the company's balance sheet we can see that the cash and cash equivalents this year have declined by about 50 million and the short-term Investments have declined by about 160 or 180 million ultimately this means that the total current assets have declined by about 200 million dollars year over year and slowly this company's cash is in fact running out now lastly I went over to the company's investor presentation for their most recent quarter and this is what they have to say and while we're reading this keep in mind that this company's revenue is not growing its expenses are growing the management is paying themselves a massive amount of stock based compensation and the company is losing more money than ever before right now now let's take a look at this slide from their their most recent quarter huge addressable Market of nearly 800 billion dollars by 2026 they have a first mover advantage they have patented Enterprise and AI application platform substantial Market partner ecosystem recognized AI Market leadership proven track record of success veteran discipline management team high performance corporate culture and excellence in execution so they're basically saying that their total addressable Market is 800 billion dollars over the next just three years so this is a massive Market that they are in and they have a first mover advantage and they're executing well"", ""here's the thing is if the overall AI Market is expanding and growing massively right now then this company not growing its sales actually means that they are losing massive amounts of market share and they're not really executing it that well they may have a high performance corporate culture and a veteran disciplined management team but the company's profits are going completely the wrong direction the company is losing more money than ever and the management is really making more money than ever at the same time so let's head back over to stock unlock and we're going to take a look at this company's income statement and very clearly right here the green bars are the revenue that the company generates and then the bars beside that red bars are the expenses or the costs for the company we can see that the overall trend here and the trailing 12 months is that the company's Revenue isn't really growing but its expenses continue growing quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter and it continues losing more and more money if we also head over to the balance sheet here and take a look at the company's total cash we can see that it peaked here in the first quarter of 2021 at 1.1 billion and ever since then every single quarter it has been losing money this is because the company is in fact losing money and it's burning through its cash position to stay in business which is exactly what we saw with the cash flow statement as well now if we also go and take a look at the recent Insider transactions there has been absolutely no buys there is no buys on the list of drop downs here on stock unlock so let's take a look at the cells and when we scroll down we can see that insiders are consistently selling off their shares large blocks of shares are being sold and no insiders ever buy this stock and all of the selling is going on all of this selling this whole entire page of selling is just within the last year back to June of 2022 so over the past year insiders seemed like they were selling off massive amount of shares and this is why the stock was declining as well this is why the stock was down like 90 from its all-time highs this is not what I'd like to see personally in management teams I like to see management buy more shares while the stock is falling and basically in all of the businesses that I own especially in smaller cap companies like this I really focus on the management team how effective are they and are they continuing to buy the shares while it's going down and I also like to see them have large positions in the stocks that I own this is not the case with AI right here""]"

other stocks with similar setups or similar momentum and then they go and buy those and that is what catalyzed lyt h-l-b-z cosm and a few others Friday morning I want to go ahead and start with lyt so we briefed on lyt because it had a similar setup to gns momentum wise and also Cola from a few weeks ago and was showing proof of concept we briefed on it at about 101 a share and I said that it was trying to break out to new extended hours highs in the pre-market watch at open and it sold off a bit into open but then at open it really popped going from The Briefing price of 101 to 227 which is a 124 run briefing price to highs absolutely great run but guess what happened it sold off afterwards so please note that zero Catalyst runs last indefinitely they run up fast they may dive just as fast if not faster"", ""that's about a 66 percent run briefing price to highs takeaways here while it's very very important to look for patent drops because when a company gets a new patent oftentimes once the rest of the market finds out and outside of patents the other big briefing winner from this morning was cwbr we briefed on this bad bad boy at 382 and it ran to 645 at highs that's about a 68 percent increase and these were some of our best plays from today's morning briefing but I also want to give you an update on amst amst we alerted as a top trade idea yesterday at 10 17 a.m Charlie California time at 4 14 a share and it ran to 598 to share this morning about a 44 increase alert price the highs and then it gave a nice little dumpy dumpito ad open and then towards Market close it started rallying again I feel pretty good about this top trade idea so far it has been a little bit slower than others but the momentum is staying consistent which you can't really say that about the other ones even with the morning Panic that the stock saw it still stayed green by midday and often if you have a big pre-market where the stock runs a lot you'll just see huge dumping the rest of the day this one did have that pre-market rally and that open dump but it bottomed pretty high and it kept trying to build more momentum off those support levels so so far the overall momentum is pretty strong and I think and I think that suggests that the next leg up might just be around the corner okay"", ""so our top trade idea right now is MF Miss fresh very fresh indeed some would say fresh eat though this fresh is in the consumer defensive space and they are trading at just a lick just a little lick above 52 two week laws despite having a pretty solid fundamental picture behind them I often like to find the most damning charts for my top trade ideas because if you can find stocks that the market has almost unanimously given up on and has unanimously decided that they don't want to touch and at the same time the company attached to that ticker if it has an actual business model even if it's not insane but if it has an operating business model well oftentimes that's all you need for a massive massive squeeze or at least the massive massive rally ralita sort of like an underdog Arbitrage situation where the stock is such an underdog that everybody hates it it looks so sketchy to touch no one wants to even look that way and when you have these Underdog trades well what happens is that if there's any sort of semblance of a business well that means there could be an insane Ricochet effect and you've already seen a lot of proof of concept of that during today's market hours and I think you're going to see more and more of these types of runs you go over to dilution tracker as you know I am allergic to two things in this world dilution and also penicillin but the second one's not relevant but dilution tracker says the overall risk is low offering ability is low dilution amount excluding shelf is low historical dilution is low and cash need is low in fact dilution tracker estimates the company has about 54.9 months of cash left so very solid from that standpoint if these numbers are correct now of course it's worth mentioning though that when you're talking about super small cap companies and you're talking about four and ones especially there can be a discrepancy between the reporting the estimates and what actually is going on and that's fine because in that discrepancy there's a lot of opportunity for trading and debate in the market to happen and that's where a lot of the fun comes in because you could trade off those moves if everything was clear and everybody had decided on evaluation of a stock well it would be flat there'd be no opportunities it's where you get into these really really small caps and some of these sketchier areas of the market where people a lot of people don't want to touch that's where you get a lot of those rally rally toe opportunities it's also where you get a lot of risk though right got to keep that in mind but anywho if you're looking at the dilution tracker numbers looks pretty good now this is a company that did their original IPO with JPMorgan City cicc and China Renaissance in mid-2021 that was at a price of 13 and the offering amount was 273 million now in days though even after today's run well the stock is trading at a market cap of just 6.39 million dollars that's a really really far cry right sure things have been bad in the super small cap market and in foreign markets and Asia and all that kind of stuff""]"

you're like why are you talking about this Heidi this already happened like that was so last week there's something that people aren't saying that I think is very important to comprehend if you guys want to know what we're talking about hit the like button if you enjoy these videos hit subscribe if you haven't done so yet there's quite a few of you out there that are watching these videos and you're not subscribed maybe you already subscribed when YouTube accidentally unsubscribed to you they do that sometimes so today we're talking about metamask and their terms and conditions uh you know it's funny because no one ever reads the terms and conditions and it you always can tell when someone has red terms and conditions for the first time because they're often shocked at what they're reading and in this time it was misunderstood and so basically metamask is owned by consensus and consensus offers a lot of different products some are able to be bought by you the end user and in their terms and conditions there was some language regarding taxes and they're basically saying if you buy one of our products we're going to charge you tax in your transaction sales tax that's basically what they're talking about but this was severely misunderstood and spread like wildfire across crypto Twitter and Reddit and all those good juicy places for crypto gossip that it was misunderstood that people were thinking that metamask was going to start withholding your taxes if you weren't paying them or if you weren't reporting your cryptocurrency transactions metamask would withhold your crypto until that was all cleared um that's not true they do not do this maybe that will happen in the future and that is the point of this video not fud just raising awareness of we tend to get used to abuse uh in any form of the matter it's really unfortunate that a lot of people make justifications because of convenience or they can put up with it and in this abuse I'm talking about government control and the issuance of I'm going to call them digital currencies not the free market cryptocurrencies that we know and love these are soon to come government issued digital currencies and the fact that so many people were worried that someone could have physical programmable control over their cryptocurrencies if they didn't play by the rules that scared them so much my friends this is a future that is coming um this is not Doom and Gloom"", ""what's up guys it's Graham here so over these last few months there's been a wave of Articles warning about the dangers of taking Financial advice from Tick Tock because I gotta say some of these videos are just hilariously wrong and could even land you in jail like take a look at this if you want to make more money like get in the nfts real estate crypto stocks like I'm into something called uh Shiba Inu coin also like just start selling like I'm selling knives out of my basement Cutlery kitchenware I can plug it like if you want to get uh some high quality kitchenware uh go to www see the thing is I love the enthusiasm but chances are nfts and Shiba Inus should not be a substitute for a long-term investing strategy and uh as far as selling knives are concerned I'm gonna take a stab at that and guess it's probably Cutco which many believe is an MLM or we have this one here which basically summarizes just copy rich people essentially his strategy is to look at SEC form four filings and then find large frequent purchases the thinking is that since insiders are purchasing in the stock they must know something that the rest of us don't but the issue is that a lot of these trades are delayed by two to Thirty days and it's almost impossible to determine just how much their portfolio is allocated to each position like you might see an Insider purchasing 500 000 worth of stock and think to yourself whoa that's a lot of money I better do some of that too and post about it on Tick Tock although if the person's worth a hundred million dollars that's the equivalent of them buying 500 of the stock if they're worth a hundred thousand dollars where if it goes to zero it's not that big of a deal point being we don't know the extent of their portfolio and whether or not an investment like that is just a drop in the bucket or it's everything they possibly have but fine with these excuses aside in this example you also have to known to sell and as you could see this guy bought in four dollars and ten cents which was pretty much the top because it currently trades for two dollars and forty cents under the ticker symbol vate the other dangerous strategy is just to assume that profits like this will last indefinitely like take a look at this if you would have invested a thousand dollars you would have turned that into five thousand nine hundred and fifty dollars in three days and then if you replicated that strategy over and over again for a year you can make seven hundred and nineteen thousand dollars nine hundred and fifty dollars I know you're not making that money see this is the type of thinking that I see really often with beginner investors they start off with a certain amount of money and then extrapolate that if they could just get one percent of that every single day they'll be a millionaire in no time which I guess kind of reminds me of this Tick Tock where it says if you double a penny for 30 days you'll have 5.3 million dollars in a month well those any amount of experience will tell you doing that consistently is pretty much impossible although if you thought that was bad just keep watching all right"", ""that's a scam that's a scam you're gonna lose your money you also have companies that are gonna say they're gonna make five percent

been coming up recently you might even see an ad for that right below me right now which is absurd again google and youtube totally dropping the ball here but this is arbitrage trading scams so they'll use the profiles of popular influencers like myself or any of the other big youtubers and they will say that there's some magical arbitrage telegram group where you give them a bunch of money and it's supposed to be me or one of the other guys and they're gonna steal your money that's a scam it's a scam if it sounds too good to be true you're getting freaking scammed please stop falling for the hundreds of scams out there the reason that these scams keep happening is because people keep falling for them please stop this is probably one of the biggest ways that people are losing crypto right now all this other stuff i'm talking about very very very important obviously but none of this stuff matters if you just hand your crypto over to the scammers willingly please please keep your head screwed on use your common sense if in doubt ask around ask some other people never be afraid to ask a dumb question because it's much dumber to have your cryptos stolen by scammers next let's talk about your passphrase this is that 12 or 24 word phrase that is basically your lifeline to your crypto if you lose that your crypto's gone and if you give that to scammers online your crypto's also gone never enter that passphrase into website never give it to someone claiming to be from support they're not from support they never need your passphrase so you might be approached on telegram by somebody saying that they're from support from some whatever company they're not from support they never need your passphrase never give it to anyone please so many people worry about you know somebody breaking into their house and stealing their passphrase or whatever else it might be but most people actually use the crypto by not being careful with it and making a mistake online with their passphrase now in terms of personal home safety obviously you should make sure your house is safe that's one very important thing but in terms of securing your passphrase that physical written copy never printed out never send it through a wi-fi printer that is a bad bad idea you want to write it down on a piece of paper using a pen old fashion""]"

In the past, I had a client that was working with this broker. They were out of New York. They sold him a mutual fund, which the advisor got paid an upfront commission, and then within six to nine months, they resold them another mutual fund that was a different share class. But the reason they did that was because the client didn't see the upfront cost. There wasn't a backend surrender charge on the investment that they sold them. So they got paid an upfront commission, had the client sell where their client didn't see anything coming out on the backend, and then resold them, basically, the exact same thing, getting paid an upfront commission, and the client not seeing that. That's what you call churn. Now churn is basically when an advisor is just buying and selling, not to your benefit, but just to make extra commissions, to get paid more money. And I promise you that is not in your best interest."", ""but they don't have a clear purpose with those investments financial advisors able to take all those pieces together and help develop a sound investment strategy a lot of times by see lacking a lot of people's investment portfolios the second reason why you want to have a financial advisor it's revenge from doing something stupid for example we're sitting here on the beach watching this guy on a paddleboat who's way often the shore oblivious to what's going on behind him the lifeguard realizing that he's way too far out there I had to go out there and prevent him the rain swept away a financial advisor can prevent you from doing those stupid things like that for example cashing in your IRA to buy a brand new vehicle another example can be taking a large chunk of your retirement account and putting it all into an individual stock I've had people that want to jump on the facebook IPO and take twenty-five fifty percent of their IRAs and buy it where did I say no you cannot do that that is a stupid move that's just like swimming off the coast way too far that's where a financial advisor can help and lastly just like the highs and lows of the tide of the ocean a financial advisor can help you ride those ways with the market I've had many people that want to get in when the markets good and when they want to get out when the markets horrible and that is not a sound investment strategy you have to be able to ride the waves and not catch now the stock market just because the media says you should a good financial advisor is your lifeguard on duty preventing you from making stupid mistakes and drowning in your poor financial decisions I don't know if you're ready I'm ready to take a swim this is jeff rose goodfinancialcents.com take care you"", ""It's only the advisor, and that's why this type of advisor deserves another punch in the face. Advisor number five is the I can use any investment that I want, I just happen to use my own company's investments advisor. Oh, this one, this one, I love it. This is the one, it's funny to me because it was so easy to point out how wrong this was. So what do I mean by this one? So let's say that you are working for an insurance company, and the insurance company has their own mutual fund products that you can sell, and you can also use other investments, let's just say like Vanguard, or Fidelity, or T. Rowe Price, but you are selling your own company's mutual funds because you think that is better for their client. So if you had these two mutual funds side-by-side and you see that your company's mutual funds, your fees are twice as high as everybody else, and even better, your return is 20% lower than everybody else, then why in the world are you going to sell them your crappy mutual funds when you can sell them everything else?

quickly go over the anatomy of the candlestick and then directly after that we'll talk more about what it actually represents and how we can use these candlestick charts to determine market direction so let's go ahead and talk about the candlestick that you see on your screen each candlestick is going to have four main points your main points are going to be the open of the candle the close of the candle the high of the candle and the low of the candle the open and close will be determined by the top and the bottom of the actual body of the candlestick the body of the candlestick is this green area you see here and green represents a bullish candle or a candle that closed above where it opened so this candle had a starting point and as soon as the our day or weekly candlestick that you're looking at started as soon as that candle starts that is considered the open and we'll talk more about top frames in just a second but that's considered the open of the candle now what happens after the open is shown by the shadows or the wicks which are these black lines here and by the close of the candle the shadows in the wicks represent where price action went so in this case we would have had a candle that started here at the open pushed down to the low then back up and then passed our clothes to the high of the candle creating that wick and then back down and closing at the end of whatever timeframe you're looking at to create the close of the candlestick so for this example let's pretend that this is a daily chart so the beginning of the day this market would have opened here at the open price action would have moved down to the low up to the high and then back down at the end of the day to close right here at or close and this is an example of the anatomy of a bullish candlestick now we'll quickly go over a bearish candlestick as well now as you may have noticed these two are very similar the only difference in a red or bearish candlestick is the fact that the close was below the open so here we have the open and again we'll use this as a daily candle just for example purposes so the beginning of the day we haven't opened here and this candle would have opened there pushed up to a high of the candlestick pushed all the way down to the low creating that bottom wick and then closed at the end of the day right at our clothes and since we have a clothes that is below our open then this candle represents a bearish day so that timeframe was a daily timeframe so that would represent a day where markets fell off a day where markets closed below where they opened and that would represent weakness in a market so that was a quick run-through of the anatomy of a candlestick again the high represents the highest point price actually got during this specific time frame for this example we were using a daily timeframe"", ""alright so now that we've quickly been over the anatomy of a candlestick let's jump into what these candlesticks actually represent and then later on we'll discuss how we can use candlestick charts to predict market direction all right guys so let's dive into what these candlesticks actually represents well each one of these candlesticks represents a specific time period if I click over here on time periods you can see that we have time periods ranging from one minute all the way to one month so with that being the case if we were to click the one-minute chart then each candlestick would represent one minute or 60 seconds of price action we would have the open of a candlestick every 60 seconds on that one-minute candlestick chart we would have price fluctuating within those 60 seconds down to the low up to the high and then we would also have the close of a candle every 60 seconds so each one of these candlesticks would represent 60 seconds on a one-minute chart and if we were on a one-month chart if we go all the way to the other end of the spectrum then the same rules apply if we were only one month chart if we were to click this one month chart here then each candlestick on that chart would represent four weeks of price action we would have an opened at the beginning of the four weeks we would have price action in between the four weeks going to the low and the high of the wick or the shadows of the candles and that's what would represent where price actions been and then we would have a close of the candle at the end of four weeks all of this is represented about one candlestick depending on the time frame your own so currently we're on a one-week chart that means that when we scroll down the chart here each one of these candlesticks represent a full week of price action for the green candlesticks we have a full week of price action that started at the open or the bottom of the green candle we have price action in between represented by these wicks coming down to the low and moving up to the high and then at the end of the week we have the close of the candle so that represents a bullish week in price action for our current pair currently we are only pound allsey so for this pair during this full week of price action we had a bullish week represented by this candle now the same thing applies for a bearish week and I'll go through that really quickly so for this case we have an open at the top of the body is where this market opened we have where price has been represented by the wicks the high and the low of the red candle and the close of the candle at the end of the week at the bottom of that body so that would represent a bearish week of price action and again guys these same rules apply no matter what time frame we're on and this can go anywhere from a 1-minute chart all the way up to a one-month chart so each one of these candlesticks represents a certain period of time and once we start putting these candlesticks together is when we can start determining market Direction based on candlestick charts so that's what we're gonna dive into now so combining all of these candlesticks together is how we can start to actually determine market direction and determine trend and also determine structure levels such as support and resistance and these are going to all be foundational parts of success in any trading career on any market understanding how to read a candlestick chart is the foundation of any good trading strategy so we have a starting point down here correct this market pushed up from this level with a nice impulsive move indicating a lot of buyers coming in from that direction now we're looking for next is to see if that level is broken so we have a high and when I say high this time I'm not talking about the high of a single candlestick I'm talking about the high that's represented about the combination of candlesticks throughout this impulsive move up which was right here the high is what's created before the pullback so this pullback represents people selling from the market a combination of people selling and the reason they're selling can be because of many different factors some people that were in down here at this level that we started from are now just taking profit other people may be jumping in based on some type of fundamental news release or based on some type of technical analysis but all of that is really irrelevant information because all we want to do is look at the chart and understand what it's doing so once we've created that high we're looking for a pullback and then the creation of a new high this 3-point move is how we can start to determine market direction once we have this 3-point move a low to a high to a pullback or higher low to a new high once that's created then we can determine that the market direction is currently up the market Direction is bullish and with that being the case we have the ability to restrict ourselves to only bullish trades to only long trades and this can really be beneficial to a trading strategy now what are we looking for after this 3-point move and this is where a lot of traders get confused well we're looking for this uptrend to continue before the break of our support level this is our support level so before this support level gets broken we expect the market to come up and break above this resistance level and continue our uptrend and that's exactly what we get here we have this pullback again selling pressure from taking profit from traders taking positions based on fundamental news events and traders taking positions based on technical analysis and then we have another push up continuing our uptrend because we've now broken above our previous high and since we have a break above our previous high into a new high we expecting we're expecting another new high"", ""but what do they actually mean well these candlesticks are nothing more than a representation of price moving over a certain period of time a daily chart would be a representation of a full day of price if this was a one-hour chart and not a daily chart it would be a representation of one day of price and what they need to be recognized as is with a green candle the green candle normally represents an update meaning that this area here is the open the bottom of the body is the open this here is the low it is the low point of the pot of the candle the bottom of that wick is the low point of this 24-hour period represented by our green candle this high point is the high of this 24-hour period and this is the close of that candle so if this candle would have started at 5:00 p.m. and then ended at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time then this is exactly what it would look like if we had an open here price moved down from our open to our low price then moved back up to our high and then price came back down and finally closed right here that is exactly what these candlesticks mean that's a great presentation of a green candlestick or a positive day in price if you're looking at a daily chart a negative day is shown by this red candle here so on this red candle we have a very similar setup except instead of the bottom of the body being to open on a red candle the top of the body is the open the top of this wick is still the high of this candle the bottom wick is still the low of this candle and the bottom of the body is the close of this candle so in the representation of this candle what we would have seen if we were watching this on a daily chart is this candle would have opened here it then went to pushed up to the high and then pushed all the way down to the low and then eventually pushed back up to close that 24-hour period right there at the bottom of this red candle so that's how you see a candlestick and that's how that's how you break down the anatomy of each and every one of these candlesticks it represents a certain amount of time depending on the time period your own everything would be exactly the same if this was one hour instead of daily this was one hour then that would still be the exact same anatomy of a candlestick so now that we've broken debt that down a little bit let's head down to a different white screen and take a look at the four green candles we were looking at right at the intro of the video so now can you spot the similarities of any of these right now what I'm gonna do is go ahead and tell you the similarity and teach you the candlestick pattern that I never hear talked about here on YouTube and that I think is one of the most accurate candlestick patterns you can use for a buying trade and that is each one of these candles closes in the top 95% of the candle each one of these candles has either a tiny wick on it or no wick on the top at all and with these being green candles what that means is that the end of whatever time period let's just say we're still on the daily for simplicity at the end whatever time period we are looking at this candle closed nearly at its high at the highest point that the participants of the market pushed this candle it dropped barely any which means there was not many sellers at the end of this candle at the end of this period if we have little to no wicks on the top of these candles that means there were no sellers at the end of this period so that gives us a good representation that we could possibly see a market head higher from a candlestick like this and the way I defined this whenever I'm trading on a 4-hour chart I'm mostly trade on for hour and you can set a Fibonacci retracement like this let me go and show you how to identify the candle so you can take a Fibonacci retracement let me put it on my candle you can then adjust your Fibonacci retracement number change it to 0.05 percent and now all you have to ask yourself is did this candle you pull a retracement from the low of the candle to the the candle did this candle land the body of the candle close above the top 5% of the candle and if the answer is yes then you have a correct candlestick formation and as you can tell each of these do that so that's one way to spot this gamma stick pattern what I do is just look for the market to only have a 5 pip wick at the top of the candle or less 5 to 6 fifths is the max so a max 5 to 6 pip wick on the top of the candle when I'm trading on a 4-hour chart but you can also use the Fibonacci tool that might make it a little bit easier for you like I said grab your Fibonacci tool with the correct setting of a 5% top 5% of the candle and then there we have it every time you want to see if you are trading the correct pattern you can just use the Fibonacci tool and make sure that that candlestick closed in the top 5% and again if it did close in that top 5% then chances are there was no buying meaning excuse me there was no selling pressure at the end of that time period so chances are there's gonna be buying pressure in the next period and that's what makes this candlestick pattern so powerful now let's move on to actually finding a few of these on sharp data and then I'll teach you a full strategy you can actually test and show you my back testing data of that strategy right after we go over this candlestick pattern on actual charts see you in just a second""]"

going to share one of the simplest strategies for budgeting and saving money so you can build a better financial future for yourself I think this is something that many people overlook but it is by far the most important aspect of a personal finance I have friends who are making two or three or four hundred thousand dollars per year yet they're still pissed broke because they don't know how to manage their finances properly so it doesn't matter if you're making ten thousand dollars a year or ten million dollars per year it's very very important to take this approach a systematic approach for budgeting and saving money and investing money and doing it properly so I'm going to share a couple of different strategies that you can use in this video right now our goal here is to help people and build wealth and create that better financial future for themselves so if you're new here to the channel you'll want to learn more about personal finance and building wealth increasing your income then consider subscribing to this channel for more videos like this one so let's just get started here now it's important to understand your why for this what is your reasoning for actually creating a budget for it for wanting to save money and in many cases people just saying well I want to save money I want to I guess increase my wealth who wouldn't but you want to dig a little bit deeper than that because this is what can actually help Drive you towards reaching those goals and setting those goals that you may have and that is by understanding your why so maybe you have a wedding coming up maybe you want to go on a worldwide trip around the world for a year and you need to save some money for it or maybe you just want to retire much earlier than the average American who retires at age 63 maybe you want to retire at age 50 maybe age 45 maybe age 35 some people do it"", ""so they just go and spend it so really the only way to fight this is to first acknowledge that lifestyle inflation is unavoidable it's going to happen to all of us and it's really important to work with it rather than just not acknowledge that it exists or think it doesn't apply to us and the easiest way to begin working with this is by paying yourself first every single paycheck before you spend any amount of money put a set amount aside that you do not touch under any circumstances for any reason whatsoever just pretend that that money doesn't even exist before it even hits your account and that way there's no chance of you ever spending it i personally recommend setting aside at least 15 to 20 of your monthly paycheck each and every month if you're able to save more than that then by all means that that will just make me even happier but just get in the habit of starting to do this consistently to prevent yourself from spending any excess money that you might have ramsay get down now when it comes to that another concern i see is that a lot of the millennials featured in these videos do not have any sort of emergency fund at all in fact sometimes it seems as though their only emergency fund is just a credit card which like i said ends up costing you significantly more than you ever need to spend if you don't have the money to pay it off immediately now for those that don't know an emergency fund is basically money you set aside to only be used in the event of an emergency where you otherwise have no other option to turn to ideally the amount in this emergency fund should be equal to three to six months worth of your living expenses and kept easily accessible for emergencies and remember when it comes to this an emergency fund is not money that you set aside just to frivolously spend as you want to it's not money that you set aside to go and invest with it's just money that you have at your disposal in case she hits the fan and you need something on short notice like if you lose a job you need to pay rent you need to pay for food your car breaks down or anything like this you got your money there already and the reason you shouldn't be investing this money is because on short notice your investments might be falling at a time where maybe you need it the most like for instance let's say a recession happens and stocks drop 30 in price and then all of a sudden you lose your job and you need your emergency funds so you start selling off your stocks after they've already dropped 30 in price when chances are you shouldn't really be selling those stocks instead you should always aim to keep your emergency fund in a high interest savings account where it's safe and where you're guaranteed to get a return on your money even if that just means you're keeping pace with inflation you could go and use ally bank which pays you 1.9 percent in interest you can go and use wealthfront which pays you 2.32 in interest or a myriad of other options out there that you have to choose from just do me one favor and make sure you get at least 1.9 in interest on a high interest savings account so that that way you can make the biggest use of your money now given all of those previous mistakes here's a bit of a backwards mistake that some people just tend to fall into because they end up too careful with money and from that they don't end up getting a credit card it's okay to err on the side of caution and make sure you don't go into debt and only spend money that you have available in your account that is all good"", ""[Music] the average household income here in new zealand is around a hundred and two thousand dollars if we combine that

households not just here in new zealand but all around the world are really concerned about their finances and how they're going to have enough money to retire when they get to that stage in their life now i am certainly no millionaire i am 25 years old i earn a fairly normal income at my job uh but i've been able to make a few key changes over the past couple of years in my life that have really propelled me forward and also have me feeling really really comfortable about being able to reach millionaire status and do it many times over and a lot earlier than a lot of people do so in this video i want to give you my top five wealth building tips that i have implemented in my own life and that i've picked up over the last couple of years and share them with you so if you do enjoy please hit like and hit subscribe but for now let's get straight into it now my first tip and this is a lesson i learned way back when i read rich dad poor dad by robert kiyosaki which was the first book on money that i ever read uh and was really impactful actually on my on my own life and that is having a focus on accumulating assets now whether that means you're someone like me who likes to purchase into the stock market or whether you like to purchase into real estate basically the idea goes like this if you can put a dollar to work in a cash producing asset that is going to produce something for you over time that is going to help you compound your net worth over a long period now if you save a dollar and put that into a bank account that that earns basically nothing that money is just sitting stagnant and is not helping you get to financial freedom as fast as you possibly can now if we instead put that money into accumulating assets let's say i have a hundred thousand dollars in the stock market earn an average rate of return of say eight percent that is an extra eight thousand dollars of income that i didn't have to go out and earn in my job and if i reinvest that eight thousand dollars next year i'm going to have 108 000 without having to put a single extra cent in and i'm gonna get even more than eight thousand dollars the next year so really in order to try and turn that 320 grand that you're probably roughly gonna save if you're the average household here in new zealand uh into something much more substantial you really have to have a focus on accumulating assets and building extra cash flow from those assets now the second tip is to be frugal and although that might not sound particularly exciting it really is a common trait of very wealthy people even someone like mega billionaire warren buffett is famous for still living in a pretty normal home living a fairly normal lifestyle not going on extravagant vacations and that's because someone like warren buffett really understands this concept of opportunity cost and when i really got this idea shoved in my head this is something that changed my own personal spending quite substantially now opportunity cost basically goes like this if i spend a dollar today on uh you know something like a coffee or spend five bucks on a coffee say uh that five dollars is gone forever i drink my coffee i enjoy it that's great but i'm really not getting any long-term benefit out of that five dollars now if i instead go ahead and put that five dollars into the stock market and again it generates an eight percent return per year or whatever that might be that five dollars is going to double roughly every nine or ten years now if we fast forward a few decades and ten years that five dollars will become say ten dollars if we go forward another ten years that ten dollars will be twenty dollars if we go forward another ten years that twenty dollars will be forty dollars if we go forward another ten years that forty dollars will be eighty dollars and so on and so on however long you want to compound that out and understanding that me spending a dollar on some sort of item that is going to disappear and i'm not going to get a long lasting benefit from is actually sacrificing much more than a dollar from my future self as something that allowed me to behave much more frugally and not spend money on stupid stuff that i frankly don't need now my third tip is to build multiple sources of income""]"
78,77,36,77_safety_company_margin_fair,"['safety', 'company', 'margin', 'fair', 'fair value', 'value', 'stock', 'bankrupt', 'price target', 'confident']","[""so let's kick it off the basic definition of what margin of safety is so Warren Buffett's Mentor Benjamin Graham well he was one of the first to talk about what margin of safety actually is and basically what it is is buying an investment for less than what that investment's worth here's his technical definition but that's the gist of it the advantage doing this is that it helps us lower our investment risk and gives us better Returns on our overall Investments so now let's jump in and look at a quick example of how we could apply this to our own Investment Portfolio so this is a chart of JPMorgan Chase's Price to Book value going back the past five years now the Assumption when we get to this point is that we've already researched the company so we already have an idea whether or not we like the company we get to the point of trying to come up with a fair value of the company because we like it we want to buy the question is where well JPMorgan Chase is an investment Bank Price Book value tends to be a good way to come up with a quick and easy fair value for that company so using this chart we can look at their own history and we could see that the average price book value of the past five years is 1.6 X currently it's trading at about that level which is why we're saying the fair value using the five-year average price to book value is 142."", ""quote Graham understood the future was largely unknowable and then investing in the stock market came with uncertainty and risk he wrote quote the future itself can be approached in two different ways which may be called the way of prediction or projection and the way of protection and quo by staying away from predicting and focusing on protection Graham gravitated towards stocks of companies that were so cheap that even if the future was worse than expected there was limited downside in their price and this plays into our next point which is finding stocks with a margin of safety buying shares of companies that had a margin of safety was a central concept in Graham's investment approach the margin of safety was intended to provide downside protection in the event that the future profits of the company deteriorated because Graham believed the future was highly unpredictable and that earnings of companies were also highly variable he favored stocks of companies that could be bought at or below their net asset value to determine this he would take a firm's current assets and net out all liabilities this formula effectively gives you the price a buyer would pay in the event of a liquidation and assigns no value to long term assets for companies valued at or below this level it was implied that there could be upside as the business improved and also limited downside in the event that the business didn't improve number five on the list you got to be willing to put in the work if you've ever picked up the intelligent investor you know it's a daunting book over 500 pages in small eight type font security analysis Graham's first book was even longer at 725 pages the thoroughness in the books reflect Graham's thinking that to fully educate yourself on the markets and value investing it takes a lot of time a lot of work and a lot of effort Todd combs one of the portfolio managers handpicked by Warren Buffett to manage part of Berkshire Hathaway's public market portfolio one said that his daily work schedule is quote literally just reading about 12 hours a day and quote the bottom-line investing takes a lot of time energy and continuous learning and it's difficult for many of us to have the patience and interest in pursuing what it takes to become knowledgeable on the markets and how to become a true value investor investors need to think more like business owners and that's number six in Berkshire Hathaway's 2013 annual letter to shareholders Warren Buffett wrote about two small real estate investments he had made one an investment in a farm in Iowa and to a building New York Siti both proved to be good investments for Buffett but that really wasn't his main objective in sharing the information with us what he was trying to emphasize is the importance that when you're buying an asset such as a stock or a piece of property you're actually buying into the business and you're entitled to the future cash flows generated by those assets Buffett writes quote stocks provide you minute-to-minute valuations for your holdings whereas yet to see a quotation for either my farm or my New York real estate investment end"", ""so how do you determine this this you will find out by analyzing the balance sheet so once you look at the balance sheet of a company you should have a good idea of the debt load of a company and you want to look for a company that has reasonable to low liabilities now do remember that some debt is healthy but you do not want to invest in a company drowning in debt so while some borrowing is important for them to have growing operations you don't want to invest in a company that has really over extended itself and they have taken on too many liabilities now another component of a great investment is free cash flow for things like acquisitions or just to get themselves out of a bad situation having a free cash flow is a very good sign and having lots of cash around so that is why i always look to invest in companies that are a cash cow or at the very least they have low liabilities or reasonable amounts of debt again the cash flow statement will tell you whether or not the company is a cash cow and by analyzing the balance sheet you'll get an idea of the debt load of a company now the fourth component of a great investment in my opinion is dividends and again this is more for an income oriented approach if you are a growth investor you are not as concerned with the dividends but if you are looking at an income investment dividends are very important and they're also very telling of the company operations and whether or not they are making good decisions and what i mean by that is if the company is restructuring dividends or they don't have a consistent dividend growth streak that is not a sign that they know what they are doing when it comes to their financials you want to see rising dividends and consistent dividends over time so what you are looking for in a good investment is a long history of uninterrupted dividend payments and do remember that if there are any abnormalities with the market there may be times when a company stops paying dividends just to the uh just to the due to the market conditions so one example of that is i know back in 2008 the drug company pfizer had to stop paying dividends for a short period of time something like that i wouldn't really care about that much because of the conditions of the market""]"

80,79,36,79_rsi_oversold_trade_34,"['rsi', 'oversold', 'trade', '34', '13', 'lower', 'leverage', 'time frame', 'frame', 'long']","[""um so this is confirmation of the oversold on the rsi so after we get confirmation that's when we enter our long trade and that long trade we ride up uh this is trade number two so on this first trade we made 2.62 on that short trade overall now if you were at leverage um you know again there's a descript link in the description for um my market cipher tutorial and and basically what leverage trading is and all that fun stuff so you can check that in the in the description below um if you're doing it at leverage well then you can magnify you can magnify both your profit and your losses significantly if you like i said i would stay away if you're brand new um but anyway we're moving into the second trade and we're making 1.14 on trade two this is a long position and then once we see this 13 cross down and over the 34 again then we know that price um is the exponential moving average of the price action is to the downside"", ""but that's the thing we don't know what's gonna happen as I said earlier when we talk about the time frame it depends on how frequently you will trade if you want to make more than 50 a day the smaller the time frames the better like the five minutes time frame but you need to know that you will be seated for a long time to be able to make a lot of profits you're going to enter a trade there go up make around one percent gain but with leverage trading you can increase your percentages gains but we will cover that in just one minute here in these lower time frames when you measure all the price movements of the RSI strategy you're not gonna get these 30 40 50 moves unless you use high leverage which is even more risky so on average when you trade on the five minute time frame you will get around one percent moves but with leverage of 10x which I do not recommend more than 10x leverage you can get around 10 gains which is pretty nice for a five minute time frame if we switch over to the 15 minute time frame for example the percentage of the moves can increase a little bit in this case we will be dealing with moves between 1.5 to 2 gains but now if we switch for the one hour time frame we can start seeing some big differences because we're gonna be dealing with an average of between five percent to seven percent gains with leverage between 5x to 10x so we can start seeing 30 50 or even 70 gains which is just crazy if you trade in the lower time frames you will trade frequently and the gains are smaller but if you trade on the higher time frames your gains are going to be bigger but it's gonna just take a lot longer to play out and it's going to be harder potentially to make that 50 a day that we want to make now I use this RSI strategy with Bitcoin because you know I usually just trade Bitcoin and ethereum sometimes I go into the altcoin Market as well on the buy bit and binance and bitflix but you can use this strategy to all altcoins and even other Commodities as well if you want but let's be honest crypto is way more fun so let's stick to crypto and buy bit in my opinion it is also important to know how to use the right leverage and set up your trades here on the derivatives trading page on buybit on the right side is where you can start trading Bitcoin and make 50 a day you can first choose if you want isolated or cross margin under isolated margin a specific amount of margin is applied to a position and the position margin can be adjusted manually in the event of a liquidation you may lose the initial margin and extra margin added to the position under cross margin all available balances of the corresponding margin account will be deployed to meet maintenance margin requirements and prevent liquidation all corresponding available balances can be lost in the event of liquid edition if you follow my YouTube channel if you press the notification Bell below um you will know that usually in my trades I use isolated margin so all of my subscribers you guys know all of these things already but this way you can choose your leverage to start using your RSI strategy and this way you can multiply your gains quickly and make even more gains as you can see you can use up to 100x leverage which is riskier than if you use just 2x leverage obviously usually I wouldn't use more than 20x leverage personally you can use maybe 10x 5x as well that's probably more appropriate if you are a beginner if you are a professional Trader I think 20 25x is also possible there are also some strategies where you can use up to 100x but that's very very risky specific strategies let me know in the comment section if you want me to make a video about a 50 to 100x strategy that's how you can make money very quickly but on the contrary also lose money so it really really is important with a good strategy in that case after choosing your leverage it's time to choose if you want to place a limit order a market order or a conditional order in this case because we're using the RSI strategy every time the RSI reaches the 30 range we want to immediately enter the trade so choosing Market orders will be better in this case it will be immediately filled at the best available price from the order book usually I just make long positions but you can also short which I think is riskier but in this case you just need to make the opposite thing whenever the RSI reaches 60s or 65 range remember never wait for the 70s range you can start the market order in this case for a short position an important part when you're placing your trades is to put a take profit and a stop loss price you just need to set up your price the take profit and stop loss depending on the uh if it's a long position or short position in this case with the RSI strategy it's highly difficult to predict when there are I will hit the 60s range so in this case I will place my long positions without taking profit but you need to be with consistent attention to the chart to see the RSI and the Bitcoin price at the same time then you're ready to place your trade which will appear down here in the positions section over on by bit for you to know in detail how to trade derivatives on buy bit you can check my buy bit tutorial I actually have the most viewed by bits tutorial on the internet go and check it out I also have a beautiful binance tutorial so check it out right now in fact I'm Gonna Leave a link down below to a playlist with a bunch of very important videos you should watch if you want to learn more about trading Bitcoin and crypto in general and guys make sure that you go and watch this video right now see you over there bye"", ""and I actually forgotten about that that was actually part of my consideration for that so forgive me for not mentioning that earlier honestly guys this alone right here was enough to make a trade off of but also if you go out to some of these longer-term timeframes and you check out the RSI what you're gonna see is the Bitcoin did actually get overextended on the RSI for the first time in a very long time the last time we saw Bitcoin overextended on the hourly our I was way back here on the 18th of June we did get overextended on the RSI down here and typically when you're doing buy positions or you're selling or excuse me not you're selling your longing especially if you're longing with leverage you want to wait until you have a good deal you want to wait until the market is oversold and then that's probably a good place to be putting in your buy positions a lot of people are asking me Jeb should I be buying up here I was like no look at the RSI look at the hourly our side why would you want to buy up there that's a terrible place to buy you're getting a horrible deal it's more likely than not that you're going to lose money on a trade like that and by the way we're not only talking about RSI when it comes to this bottom right here if you look at the MACD out here on the hourly chart then you will see that MACD histogram actually started reversing direction and started converging bullish on itself right around the time that this RSI divergence was happening right here you can see that change right there""]"
81,80,35,80_retire_save_income_child,"['retire', 'save', 'income', 'child', 'expenses', 'early', 'saving', 'month', 'spending', 'living']","[""and I promise you once you start you're not going to want to stop not to mention you could use the link in the description in our sponsorpublic.com we'll be giving you a free stock worth all the way up to a thousand dollars when you make a deposit with the code gram so hopefully that should at least give you a bit of a head start all right now from the age of 25 to 29 there really aren't that many changes with an average net worth of forty nine thousand three hundred and eighty seven dollars except it's worth noting that the median net worth in this category actually went down to 7 500 and 11 likely because this is the age you begin moving out on your own getting adult responsibilities stop having fun and having to pay your own cell phone bill however if you're in the top one percent in this category you're going to see your net worth increase to 606 188.36 to be honest at this age your priority should really be about finding a good long-term career building to your strengths and maximizing your income to be able to save as much money as possible ideally you should also be tracking your expenses keeping a budget and understanding how much you're going to need saved and invested in order to retire I know it could sound really boring to start thinking about right now but the truth is when it comes to investing starting in your 20s could put you so much further ahead by the time that you're older just consider this if you want to have one and a half billion dollars invested by the age of 65 you could do that by investing 416 dollars a month beginning at the age of 25 at an average of an 8 return however if you procrastinate and don't get started until the age of 35 you would need to invest almost a thousand dollars a month to reach that exact same goal so if the choice is yours save 416 dollars now or a thousand dollars a month later speaking of your 30s though this is the age where you'll really begin to see the biggest differences for example the media net worth of those aged 30 to 34 is 35 000 the average is a hundred and twenty two thousand dollars and if you want to be in the top one percent of this category you need to be worth about a million dollars although if you thought that was a lot just wait if we look at the exact same category for those aged 35 to 39 the media net worth jumps to fifty five thousand dollars the average more than doubles to two hundred and seventy four thousand dollars and the top one percent have a net worth of more than four million dollars so what just happened well most likely this is the time your income and career really begin picking up this could also be the point where some people are fortunate to exit their business benefit from an IPO or have a few very well-timed Investments that bump up the top one percent although in terms of actionable steps that you could take throughout your 30s to dramatically increase your net worth here's what I would recommend first aim to completely get rid of any bad debt this means you paid off any loans above a six to seven percent interest rate you don't have any outstanding credit card debt or personal loans and besides the possibility of a mortgage you have nothing else weighing you down the second you should try to save at least twenty percent of your income my personal approach with this that's worked really well for me is that anytime I make more money I just pretend that money doesn't exist"", ""they either just make drastic lifestyle changes way too late or they just accept that they'll never be ahead financially which is not going to happen on my watch that's why my number one piece of advice for anyone between the ages of 18 and 35 is just to spend less money than you make i know this one might sound common sense to you and i but believe me it's not common sense to most people out there especially when you consider that forty percent of americans don't have enough in savings to cover a one thousand dollar emergency so the easiest way to get out of that trap is to cut back on your spending and get rid of any discretionary expenses that you might have also websites like mint.com and personalcapital.com are completely free and incredibly easy to use and believe me trust me when i say this the hardest part about doing all of this is just starting and just starting to turn this into a habit and a routine but once you start doing this the benefits are going to become monumental you're going to have extra money left over at the end of every single week and you're going to have disposable income left over that you can now go and invest with this step is really just about seeing the long term and realizing the opportunity that you have right now to begin investing as soon as possible these are really your prime savings years because you have the power of compound interest behind you so you may as well just take advantage of that while you still can i'm not sure if you can see ramsay here by the way but in the last video a lot of people were complaining that i wasn't giving ramsay enough pets so i'm going to give ramsay some pets here here you go and one of the tricks i often do when it comes to spending and saving money is i just think to myself if i don't go and buy something it's like i almost got paid not to buy it like for instance because i didn't go out and spend ten dollars on a hamburger on my drive home from work i just saved ten dollars which is kind of like i got paid an extra ten dollars not to spend it if that makes sense this way your brain almost starts to rewire itself and rewards you for not spending money because you act as though that is just money you got paid not to spend i don't know if that makes sense let me know if that hopefully makes sense now given that statistic about 40 of americans not being able to afford a thousand dollar emergency that has been fairly consistent among all the money related videos that i've seen where the subjects of the videos have gotten themselves into horrible credit card or student loan debt i've seen everything from tens of thousands of dollars in outstanding credit card bills to egregious student loan balances and otherwise just a lack of consideration for trying to pay those down as soon as possible and here's the thing i really believe that having any amount of unpaid consumer debt will grossly hinder your ability to build wealth in the future it's almost as though you're borrowing from tomorrow and the day after to go and pay for today if that makes sense so if at all possible avoid consumer debt at all costs use it only as a last case resort if something terrible happens and you just you need it to put food on the table or there's just no other option to turn to except for a credit card but do not make that a substitute for i can't afford to eating out with my friends every single night at nobu and malibu"", ""let's say right before retirement and finally from all the advice in this video this is the one that i feel like is the most important you should use your 20s as a time that you could just work your ass off save as much money as you can and use all of that to get ahead now is the time to absolutely pursue any career aspirations you might have to work harder than you ever thought was possible and to save more money than you ever thought was imaginable because trust me as someone who did that throughout their entire 20s i'm 29 years old now and i've pretty much set myself up to never have to worry about this stuff ever again for the rest of my life because of what i did between the ages of 18 and basically now and while sure it's okay to relax and have fun every now and then just stay disciplined because the work that you put in right now and the money you save right now could be enough to carry you forward throughout the rest of your life because i'll tell you from my experience it just becomes more difficult as you get older you're probably not going to have as much energy as you did back when you were 18 you're probably just going to start needing maybe just a little bit more sleep and you're going to start wanting to try new and better things and having that money invested in the bank is going to give you the flexibility to pursue the things you really want to pursue while getting the heavy lifting out of the way early on and also during all of that it's just as equally as important to focus on now starting to increase your income at the exact same time as you're focusing on decreasing your expenses and saving as much money as possible and sometimes people just can't save enough money and it's not a fault of budgeting or a lack of just frivolously spending a lot of times these people just don't make enough money and instead they need to focus on increasing their income rather than trying to scrimp and save as much as they possibly can while not earning a lot that's why beyond a certain point it's worth it to start switching jobs if that means you could start making a little bit more money or maybe learn new skills so that you could start increasing your income and working towards something that's potentially a little bit more financially ambitious and when it comes to investing just keep it simple a broad index fund is just one of the easiest simplest and safest ways to invest your money when you hold it long term it's really as easy as just buying a target date retirement fund or just one simple broad index fund continuing to buy more each month and just doing that over and over again or it could also be as simple as spending an hour a day on bigger pockets in youtube just learning how to invest in real estate and then going on weekends to check out open houses and then by the time you have your down payment ready you'll be able to invest in real estate and learn exactly how it's done and if there's any piece of millennial money investing advice that i highly recommend it's to really focus on cutting down your living expenses as much as you possibly can while you're young arguably housing is one of the biggest recurring monthly expenses that you're going to have so figuring out how to reduce this while you're young is going to have the biggest impact going forward long term""]"

when you borrow a stock from a broker sell it at the current market price and cover your shares which means to buy it back in order to give it to the broker so with this obviously the goal is for this stock price to go down so that when you return the share to the broker it cost less to repurchase and cover your shares than it did when you originally sought to borrow chair now of course zip trader has always been focused on giving you the resources and the tools that you need to consistently grow your account and that means that regardless of the market condition you're going to need to have different strategies to take advantage of it as I always say regardless of if the stock price is going up or down there are still opportunities to take advantage of it that doesn't even necessarily mean short you can take advantage of decreasing positions by buying them as well but shorting is another way that we can make a profit when the market is going down or when the stock that we're watching is going down and with that in mind the only thing that we should fear is actually the market not moving because if it's not going up or down we can't profit off it that's why we as traders don't fear an increasing market or a decreasing market the only thing that we should fear is a slow market when nothing's moving that's going to be harder for us to make a profit nonetheless there are opportunities regardless of the type of market condition that we're in and today we're going to be focusing on short positions so as traders when we use the short function in our platform what we are doing is we're basically borrowing shares from the broker we are making an agreement to the broker that regardless of what happens to the share price that we will return the shares to that broker so let me apply this to an example just so it's easier to visualize so say we were watching Tesla and notice it has a comeback King pattern where every time it is overbought it tends to go to oversold shortly after within that same time span so we can then hatch a plan we could tell ourselves"", ""but if you're planning on being married only for like 15 minutes please protect your assets how you exit a marriage is key and that means entering the marriage in the first place with a clear plan and some sort of document that you have to hold to that says you get to keep your stuff and when it comes to the stock market the best prenup you have is some sort of clearly planned exit point or stop loss or something of that nature now moving forward into this coming week I'm looking to see if it can retain just a small bit of its previous run if it can do that I believe it'll be relevant for Rebound opportunities next hlbz so hlbz followed genus's lead and decided to investigate their own naked Short Selling we briefed on them at about 18 cents and it ran to just under 37 cents the company had shown proof of concept in the pre-market momentum wise and had announced a discontinuation of operations and unprofitable markets on top of that like I just mentioned they followed gns's lead in investigating short sellers which is going to drive a lot more interest into the stock moving forward which I believe is going to show very very clearly in the coming week or two that said from a trading perspective if you're looking at this for Rebound opportunities moving forward you want to make sure that you see actual proof of concept again usually that comes in the pre-market what is proof of concept it's actually being able to run solidly above an SMA line or a certain percentage gain in a short period of time proof of concept is exactly what it says it is showing that it can run before you blindly guess that it can run if subbing is diving 20 a minute well obviously that's not showing proof of concept right that's a falling knife if something has slowed down and and all of a sudden it's starting to pick up again and going up a little bit showing a bit of confirmation over an SMA line then all of a sudden at least you have some proof of concept right and people say oh proof of concept it's not a guarantee that it's going to continue running obviously not but at least at least you're filtering out the ones that can't even have enough strength to go up a slight smidgen you are free to buy in something when it's dumping like a dog but don't complain afterwards that it's continued dumping next cause them a similar deal they are also in the short seller battle if you did your homework you know back on December 9th they enlisted shareholder intelligence services or share Intel to help them identify abusive Short Selling which of course set the stage for them to benefit from momentum Traders looking to buy short fighting stocks and we briefed on cosm at 348-ish on Friday morning and it ran to 642 at highs and this folks is the power of doing your homework and showing up every day for folks that say oh Charlie you know there's no value in doing your homework and following Trends and looking for patterns because patterns don't 100 repeat them ourselves well this is what I have to show you if you can acknowledge what the market is thinking and then look at what the market has done in the past in terms of rallying up similar stocks well you can start getting yourselves on the front lines when certain catalysts drop and they start causing stocks to run do little rally rally does and that's exactly how we find all these briefing plays and building off that if you are looking for more trade ideas heading into this coming week here is a cheat sheet here are the three major types of stocks and criteria that you need to be looking for number one stocks that announce or have announced Short Selling investigations which I believe a lot more announcements are coming because it's an obvious win for companies that do it their stock goes up right after they can explain away their bad stock performance to their shareholders saying it's all the short seller's fault and so everybody's happy so it's a win-win if stocks start investigating their short sellers right number two small caps that consistently hold momentum in the pre-market a lot of Runners stem in the pre-market and then add on after open number three you want to look for any sort of FDA approval or other regulatory biotech Catalyst like positive phase trials those will will have extra Firepower in this ripe small cap environment now of course if you'd like us to do the research for you and present you with daily morning briefings each market open morning we do offer that as part of our overall zip Trader you program link down below and our coupon code to celebrate the gns run is still active coupon code gns was set to expire Friday but then gns ran up to 5 45 that morning and it felt really really disrespectful to cancel its namesake coupon code when the stock was still running and giving more reasons to celebrate"", ""I'm going to go ahead and sell short the stock at 318 that means that you are now directing the broker to let you both borrow and then sell a share at that market price of 318 that means that every dollar goes under 318 you get to keep that extra dollar and if the stock drops down to oversold at 268 which it did here that means that now you only have to pay 268 to repurchase that chair and return it to the broker the broker doesn't care about how much you have to pay to repurchase the share they just want the share back and because you're able to get it back to them at such a discount you get to keep the extra profit and again if you didn't catch this earlier this process of repurchase in the share to give it back to the broker that's called covering your position you're covering the shares that you owe the broker and in this case covering your shares at 268 would have netted you a profit between the 318 that you sold these shares short at and and the 268 which you repurchase that which have knitted you a profit if you bought one share of that of $50 but on the other hand if you sold short at the same point and the share goes up to say $400 then you have to pay 400 to return that one share back to the broker since you borrowed insult to share short of 318 you now have to pay 72 more dollars to buy it back then when you had originally bought the share and that is basically short selling in a nutshell of course the topic of contention when it comes to comparing their regular purchase of stocks going long on a stock to shorting stocks is the different level of risk involved with each of them now I make a concerted effort in each of these videos to always touch on the risks involved with any of these strategies or any of the different ways that we go about trading the market""]"

interested check out the platform link down below in the description they have great reviews over 100 000 accounts created actively using the platform and a great range of exposure to various features that help make your crypto ira even more powerful now one last thing that i wanted to talk about here guys that builds into this discussion point we've had is focusing on the narrative of the exchange trade funds or atns as well like gptc and the corporate treasurers the companies out there that are holding bitcoin on their balance sheets this was a huge talking point back in 2020 and 2021 and of course all the while the trend has been relatively silent therefore a lot of people have not talked about it as recent they've started to kind of slow down on this narrative being something that we should focus on but i actually think it's something we should revisit it's something we should be keeping an eye on if we take a look at the metrics here over time even though grayscale has been reducing its etf shares over time we can see that the etf volume overall globally has remained relatively neutral since back here in the start of 2021."", ""so that being said guys let's run straight into the video let's have a look what's happening with the markets for today you can see right now that bitcoin's price is coming in at around 26 700 this is also affecting the rest of the market what we would usually see with the way that the crypto markets ebb and flow and we have they fluctuate is that usually the stock market or the general economic Outlook that sort of affects how the crypto markets perform it affects ultimately Bitcoin first and then it will also affect the rest of the all coins so it'll affect ethereum and ethereum's the king of the old coins and that will affect the rest of how the market will perform if we have a look at some of the key data it's important too you can see here that the Bitcoin dominance is coming in at around 46 and ethereum stoleness is staying strong at 19 we've seen ethereum's dominance over the past few years increase just that bit by bit and that is I think affecting the rest of the market in a positive way we're not seeing the majority of the capital being put into Bitcoin as much as we want to see Bitcoin do well we also want to see the rest of the market perform well as well and for that to happen we need to see the Bitcoin a dominance be below 50 and ethereum someone's you know staying at around 20 and the rest of those percentages be in the rest of the all coins the market cap as well for the rest of the market or the whole Market altogether is about 1 trillion is 1.1 trillion dollars this is a significant amount of money that's in the market but it's nothing compared to the rest of the stock market I think the stock market is something like 50 60 trillion dollars worth in terms of its market cap the market cap for gold is something like 12 trillion dollars"", ""so like I said everything is pointing out for the market to be at the bottom already and everyone kind of already figures that and if it wasn't for what I'm about to share with you I honestly would be buying all this up in dollar cost averaging in but there's something really big happening that a lot of people are overlooking and I was too onto I watched another video and realized just how big this actually is now to understand this we're gonna need to zoom out instead of just looking at the crypto markets we have to look at the traditional markets as well so stocks equities bonds real estate because everything is all tied together now whether you like it or not now I'm going to explain it just as it was explaining the video because it did a really good job getting the point across so basically think of a big skyscraper and within that skyscraper we have all the markets that I mentioned so stocks bonds Equity Real Estate everything is within the skyscraper and then in the basement all the way at the bottom of the skyscraper we have our little itty bitty crypto market so in our tiny Market in the basement everyone is partying having a good time thinking crypto has finally bottomed out and things are only going to go up from here but what they don't understand is that we have all these other big markets right on top of us so when all these markets end up crashing down what do you think will happen to the price of crypto now we don't know how low we can go but the point is there is a huge possibility of this happening and it could send prices crashing and the reason I know this can happen is because of what I'm about to tell you now what people need to understand is yes we're in a crypto bear Market but this is the first time that we're in a macro bear Market as well meaning all the other Investments are down as well because previously in history every time crypto would be in these beer markets um 2013 2017 2022 these other markets were perfectly fine if anything they were thriving so even though at the time of those crypto bear markets large investors or whales that were in crypto""]"

place emphasis on marketing you're gonna have the money from sales or business to actually invest in your company to build a better website better product all that stuff when you're focusing on all those unimportant details you're actually procrastinating from doing the things that are most important and that is getting business or sales and that comes from marketing i will say it's definitely a huge shift from going from an employee to a founder before you likely did not have to actually get the business in right you just had to fulfill it now unfortunately you have to do both now one specific subset of marketing that i think is going to apply to everyone watching this video is personal branding if you've seen any of my other videos you'll know that i'm super big on personal branding it can help you start any business with a much greater chance of success this is basically just marketing for yourself which equates to marketing for your business i cannot emphasize how much personal branding has changed my own life and that's why i talk about so much in my videos right anyone an introvert extrovert poor rich we all have a great shot at building a personal brand and a lot of people just don't realize how much of a difference this can have on your entrepreneurial journey it really is unfair because now i can start a business tomorrow and have a 10 times higher chance of success versus me five years ago and the main difference is because you know those skills of course but also because now i have a personal brand if you guys actually want to learn how to build your own personal brand i have my own flagship program called the personal brand master class it is six weeks long you get your own success coach live q a calls and our own community where you can talk with other like-minded people"", ""the are wise on ads are crazy but when you can do this guys when you can run Facebook ads you can write very good sales videos you can close on the phone you can identify blue ocean markets and you can network with people who will make you good procs you have two trifecta I don't understand what the word trifecta means but you have the trifecta of everything you need to build a business virtually anything so your main job as a entrepreneur is just looking out for opportunities and as soon as you see an opportunity you have every skill you need to build the type of company that you can build that can make you a lot of money because you have all the things for the perfect storm of selling something now if you're just starting off what you don't want to do is you probably don't want to build a high investment business you want to do a cash flow business example these are consulting businesses or where you provide manual labor for businesses what you could do is you could partner with an engineer and you guys could provide a certain type of service for businesses you could partner with someone who's very good at building certain types of funnels for businesses or optimizing their phone calls or something like that that's huge you could find in the e-commerce niche specific types of products and prod combinations that that fill the need for a very underserved market but that that niche overall is just blasted what I always suggest doing if you're beginner is you find a manual labor niche that's where you provide a very unique service using your own time is this scalable"", ""and I can provide a unique service to a business or sell a unique product to people that are not being served at all how do you do this what you want to do is you want to go and look in face or groups of specific markets probably edge markets everybody's going to go after this market as soon as I mention it right here but for example surgeons who do specific types of surgeries if you were to find for example a specific type of surgeon and go and develop an app for them go and find some way to maximize the phone calls coming into their business find some way for their business that convert 10 percent more people find a product or thingamajig that would allow them make more revenue from their business you could easily sell it for twenty to fifty thousand dollars to them or even make an app that gets people on there and cost fifty thousand dollars a year it's not that's not that hard to do and with basic marketing you could probably get them too biased because no one's really offering this that's what I'm talking about right there so find edge markets and in find where their business can be improved a lot of brick-and-mortar businesses a lot of common business models that have huge upfront sales volumes or cost are completely wide open that's what you want to do first go and read what these people are doing don't go look in marketing groups and business groups and look what they're doing look at what other people and businesses nobody even knows exists are doing for example people that sell the bots that put certain types of packages together for example I had a friend who started the business like this already got into a business like this the business exploded and it had cavemen like sales methods you want to get in a blue ocean and you want to be know how to look for this next sales video copywriting I've generated tens of millions of dollars online because I know how to get in from a video and what to say to get people interested in buying something now the biggest key of all is spotting a market in a product that people actually want to buy and is unique and will deliver value to them the best way to do it is again talking to people in the market and really figuring them out that's the best thing how I created high risk I was literally at a mastermind I was listening to people complain and complain complain about a certain product about a certain problem they had and I fixed that problem for them all those people on the mastermind are great percentage of them are on the product now including all their friends and everybody else one of the main things is once you have a product like that if you can communicate in a sales video how to get them on board this is the best way to do it because then you can simply run ads to that sales video and get them in the next funnel that I'm going to talk about right here""]"

source blockchain-based social network would be to finance and Advance its development musk called it a super interesting idea and offered to help however once Dorsey failed in his attempt to get musk on the Twitter board he eventually left the company but now that Ellen musk owns Twitter this completely changes everything it is the only answer to creating a completely unbiased decentralized social media platform many experts expect decentralized social media to be the next huge Market opportunity which top crypto research firms have assessed to so ranked first in massari's seven other crypto

someone's content is stored on the social graph it can be used with any front-end program built on lens they're not locked in an identity on lens well anchored by nfts users mint nft that matches their identity it's all encompassing and followers receive follow nfts to signify that they're following someone and those can actually be encoded with additional values meaning profiles can be easily monetized and also that dowels will probably be created for group decisions imagine a Mr Beast dial work a bit Squad down we can do things together and it would be a group decision so these nfts are the central pillar for how diesel is going to interact with defy and identity decentralized identity is coming and it's a great use case for nfts now lens has dot lens addresses similar to dot ease

which asset prices 1 offer little chance of any positive risk premium relative to bonds or cash using any reasonable projection of expected cash flows and 2 they are sustained because investors believe they can sell the asset to someone else for a higher price tomorrow with little regard for the underlying fundamentals notably there are markets in which few if any buyers care about the discounted future cash flows to value an asset the 1999 to 2000 tack or dot-com bubble is the poster child for a broad market bubble at the height of this bubble aggressive assumptions were required to believe that the entire US stock market would deliver a positive risk premium relative to then prevailing bond and cash yields for the tech sector in particular to deliver a risk premium compared to the 6% bond yields available at that time most tech stocks would have had to produce rapid growth far into the future even though a few could have succeeded unless their fierce competitors were also struggling in hindsight using our simple definition the tech bubble was indeed a bubble and could have been identified at the time more importantly many observers in the midst of the bubble correctly perceived it for what it was at the beginning of 2000 the 10 largest market caps tech stocks in the United States collectively represented a 25% share of the S&P 500 Microsoft Cisco Intel IBM AOL Oracle Dell Sun Qualcomm and Gila Packard didn't live up to the excessively optimistic expectations over the next 18 years not a single one beat the market 5 produced positive returns averaging 3 percent a year compounded far lower than the market return and two failed outright of the 5 that produced negative returns the average outcome was a loss of 7.2 percent a year compounded or 12 and a half percent a year less than the S&P 500 eerily similar to the new economy dogma of the dot-com bubble is today's cryptocurrency craze it boggles the imagination to hear people speaking of investing in Bitcoin an electronic entity that offers no hope of future off operating profits or dividends is little used as a surrogate for money in transactions offers an uncertain longer-term use case and has no objective basis to determine its fundamental value how many investors are holding cryptocurrencies for any purpose other than the expectation that someone else will pay a higher price at some point in the future we see a bubble in the US stock market today albey albeit less extravagant than the growing swarm of cryptocurrencies reasonable observers can disagree but we believe we are experiencing a tech bubble based on a relatively rigorous definition of the term at the end of January 2018 the seven largest market cap stocks in the world were all tech fliers alphabet Apple Microsoft Facebook Amazon $0.10 and Alibaba never before has any sector so dominated the global roster of the largest market cap companies now let's focus on how investors should react in response to a bubble a reasonable first step is to sell or great really reduce our holdings of bubble priced assets the two most dangerous things about a bubble are that one markets can go far beyond any objective valuation measure and two investors can never know with any confidence when the bubble will pop in the market will turn whereas a bubble is not as hard to identify in real time as is commonly perceived transforming a bubble into a profit even for investors who correctly discern it is a tremendous challenge because late stage bubbles can take valuations into the stratosphere investors can actually provide their own most appropriate response to a bubble by answering a very simple question how much shortfall can I tolerate for two consecutive years without panicking each investor has a unique threshold for at risk the difference between their managers performance of the performance of the managers peers above all whatever bets we take should not be sized to succeed our clients tolerance for maverick risk we recommend for actions of investor can take to protect themselves and even benefit when the bubble eventually bursts first an investor can materially reduce or eliminate their exposure to bubble assets if we cannot construct a reasonable scenario in which the bubble assets could offer an acceptable risk premium the greater fool rationale someone will pay more for it later resembles picking up nickels in front of a steamroller at a minimum we can underweight these assets second an investor can seek anti bubbles in the market and invest in them anti bubbles are sectors or markets priced at levels that cannot plausibly deliver anything but a large risk premium an anti bubble cannot exist in a single asset because almost any assets price can drop to zero but consider junk bonds financials and consumer durables in early 2009 these asset classes weren't going to disappear each failure of a single company meant that the survivors in that sector had less competition higher margins and a clear runway collectively the sector itself couldn't fail to deliver a very large risk premium firing a handful of genuine Armageddon scenarios emerging markets value stocks in early 2016 were a similar example wrathy the fundamental index in emerging markets fell to a Shiller p/e ratio of 5.6 times earnings an earnings yield of 18% in a world of zero yield bonds and cash emerging markets value was an obvious anti bubble similar to the trajectory of a bubble an anti bubble continues to collapse until it doesn't until it turns therefore averaging into our positions with an eye towards not exceeding in it our investors tolerance for maverick risk is a prudent way to invest an anti bubble can be a rich source of profit for the patient investor third an investor can diversify into investments that are not in bubble territory for example as of early 2018 emerging market equities and many developed countries stock markets are trading at discounts to their historical valuations rather than the extravagant premium of the S&P 500 as a paper by Arnott kolesnik and masters""]"

danger of the National Default growing Democrats are hoping an unlikely savior will come to the rescue Mitch McConnell of Kentucky Democratic lawmaker Sam McConnell and other Republicans are fooling themselves if they think McCarthy is in a position to reach a debt deal with Biden they believe McCarthy is under tremendous pressure to not agree to any Deal Democrats would accept because the house rules allow for one disappointed conservative to offer a motion to vacate the speaker's chair basically to fire him now Senate Republicans are putting their heads in the sand if they think that extremists in their party will have a change of heart if McCarthy is forced to choose between holding power or taking us closer to default we know he's going to move us closer to default yikes uh so now they're trying to get McConnell to negotiate a deal with the quote reasonable Republicans oh dear McConnell I would have never been con I mean this is wild they're now calling McConnell a reasonable Republican maybe he is maybe he's changed I just think anybody who remembers the kova days so frustrated by Pelosi and"", ""they can make more money number two they can spend less money or number three they can increase the cred credit card limit and continue taking loans out from the credit card because they now have a higher line of credit that's what the US government is doing every single year when this becomes an issue instead of raising expenditure by raising taxes or cutting the deficit by cutting expenditure the government just kicks the can down the road by raising the debt ceiling this debt ceiling then therefore becomes a political football between fiscal conservatives who want to cut expenditure and liberals that want to increase expenditure while also increasing taxes and that's the exact position that we're in right now there has become a showdown between Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican house Speaker Kevin McCarthy house Speaker Kevin McCarthy leads a theoretically Coalition of fiscal conservatives that want to get the budget under control Joe Biden leads the Democrats who are much more inclined to spend more money and just raise the deficit even farther Kevin McCarthy and Joe Biden have been going back and forth for weeks trying to reach some kind of agreement that would raise the debt limit stopping the United States government from entering into a default just a couple of days ago speaker McCarthy tweeted this I just got off the phone with president obedico after he wasted time and refused to negotiate for months we've come to an agreement in principle that is worthy of the American people it seems that there's a last minute agreement coming through and there more than likely will be nobody on Capitol Hill wants to be the person that caused the entire global economy to collapse but the uncertainty of whether or not that will occur is hanging over the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and stock market like a dark cloud and for good reason treasury secretary Janet Yellen says a U.S default would trigger a global economic downturn and Moody's predicts that a default would lead to 6 million jobs lost 12 trillion dollars in household wealth evaporating and four percent of gross domestic products disappearing on top of that that would lead to a complete demise of United States treasuries which are widely considered to be the safest investment you can possibly make a default on U.S debt would be the destruction of the United States economy and would send shock waves through geopolitics for the rest of the century basically it'd be the movie 2012 meets the big short but the debt ceiling is likely to have an agreement rate Sean in the next couple of days and then after that comes through we'll likely see a rally on the stock market which will then lead to a rally on bitcoin however it's not all Sunshine rainbows after that happens because we're still having to deal with CPI you see the Consumer Price Index is a metric that tracks inflation in the United States economy and everything thing from shelter to gasoline to natural gas or electricity to eggs and then CPI is broken up into two categories number one all items and number two all items minus food and energy while all items has been coming down nicely to 4.9 percent all items less food and energy currently sits at 5.5 percent and its drop is completely stagnative over the course of the last five months CPI dropping is a very good thing but the problem is all items and core inflation that being all items minus food and energy have both started to stagnate right around five percent and this season of inflation coming down very aggressively is likely to be over starting this month when the next data comes out on June 13th in fact many economists are predicting that inflation is going to get a lot stickier under the five percent Mark for all items and for core inflation and that's very important because that impacts Jerome Powell's fed's decision on effective federal funds right hikes you see the effect of federal funds rate is described by the New York fed like this the effective federal funds rate is calculated as a volume weighted median of overnight federal funds transactions in English the effective federal funds rate is more or less the base rate that all other interest rates in the United States economy are based off of that includes car loans Home Loans personal loans commercial loans and pretty much any other kind of loan including credit card loans whenever the infected federal funds rate increases then that causes every single other interest rate to increase which increase the cost of taking on debt which reduces the amount of liquidity in the United States market and makes it harder to expand because we live in a credit and debt based society the FED has been hiking rates at their fastest rate in over 40 years in a Hail Mary attempt to try and get inflation under control the problem is that inflation is not going down anymore because of the hiking interest rates it's staying sticky at five percent because of various geopolitical realities that the FED has no power over whereas many of us were hoping for a Fed rate pause come June 14th when the meeting happens now many people including myself are predicting that we're going to see another 25 basis point rate hike from 5.15 percent all the way up to 5.4 another rate hike when we were hoping for a pause would almost certainly lead to a major drop in Bitcoin especially considering the right decision will come out the day after CPI comes out which is likely to be lackluster in conclusion Bitcoin has been looking forward to a very bullish June as a result of a recent Lux algo Buy Signal and a bullish cross on on macd followed by a bullish cross above the 50 level on RSI however as a result of the uncertainty around the debt ceiling we've seen timidity coming from the United States stock market as it attempts to break above critical resistance at 420 that timidity is spilled over into Bitcoin and means that it's having a hard time going into a rally as well that timidity on U.S stocks is going to continue until we reach a decision on the debt ceiling hike because many people are predicting if a decision does not get made and the United States defaults on its debt the stock market could drop by over 45 percent 20 trillion dollars and while there is most likely going to be a decision reached which will lead to that timidity Vanishing in the United States stock market just a week after that decision is probably going to be raged on June 5th or 6th then we're probably going to see bearish data coming from CPI in the very next day on June 14th we're going to see a Fed rate hike when we were hoping for a pause all of that to mean that the first two weeks of June are shaping up to actually be very difficult for Bitcoin and if we see any bullishness from Bitcoin we should take that as a great sign of the health of the market because it's got so many things standing in its way right now but the thing I want you guys to remember is that these dark clouds are temporary I just decision on the debt ceiling will be made in the next week and the decision that seems to be taking place will kick the can down the road for another two years and we won't have to worry about until January of 2025."", ""Biden and McCarthy they reached a handshake deal on the debt ceiling both parties are claiming success while many in both parties are saying they got nothing out of it carthy came out to tell the American people that this was transformational while Jeffries said it was an incredibly significant step towards protecting Social Security here's the bottom line the government's in gridlock Republicans control the house Democrats control the Senate so they have to compromise Wall Street thinks this is a good thing because they do not want any one party to Rule the Day president has to sell it to the Democrats and McCarthy has to sell to the Republicans to get a place of agreement there's a ton of reasons why members in both parties would not sign and would not agree because largely in my view after looking at the agreement there was really very minor concessions made on all sides no somebody was getting a lot out of the deal it kind of was business as usual in Washington but here's the timeline that we're gonna watch it gets kicked off on Wednesday the house is going to vote and then it's gonna go if it passes there to the Senate and those guys will have four days to get it passed if they sign it in that four day period it's then going to get rushed over to the president who's going to sign it into law if everything went perfectly that would give us the date of June 5th which would be next Monday for a resolution to the debt ceiling crisis we already know though that Janet Yellen has been out sounding the alarms that the U.S government will absolutely run out of cash early June and if we were to default she has said many times that it would cause severe damage to financial institutions as well as the general economy and on that note a recent analytics report said that a brief debt ceiling breach would slash 1.5 million jobs wow raising unemployment from 3 point four percent to five percent my first thought on that is well that would make the FED happy his goal is to get unemployment up to begin to put pressure on inflation and that would immediately solve that concern so you really never know what the powers that be may do in this situation and we also got a report from Goldman Sachs they predicted that the treasury will run low on cash by June 8th or 9th unless the debt ceiling limit was raised this basically means that the government is just barely screeching across the finish line to get this whole thing resolved now I have to play this clip by Warren Buffett on balancing the U.S budget because in my view it is timeless classic war and wisdom and it's spot on so check this out these problems aren't been mature enough for a president that's been mature enough to take this head off""]"

at researchaffiliates.com and raffi.com i will read a piece titled a quick survey of quote-unquote broken asset classes introduction pundits prognosticators and even investment boards often make misleading declarations that an asset class is broken that its prospects for earning investors a reasonable future return are very dim these proclamations can lead to investors abandoning these assets to chase recent winners advisors are uniquely positioned to educate their clients about historical asset class returns and to provide context for recent perhaps disappointing performance in this way advisors can prepare their clients for substantial variations in an assets returns a prepared client is a confident one and confidence begets the tenacity to hold assets over the long term raising the likelihood of a successful investment experience via diversification rebalancing and long-term compounding and isn't that what financial advice is all about warnings of the long-term impaired viability of asset classes have spooked investors through history one of the most notorious was businessweek's cover story the death of equities published in 1979 u.s stocks are not alone however other quote-unquote broken asset classes abound by the late 1990s reits were dismissed as losing the power to diversify a portfolio and a 1999 article in the economists concluded cheap oil is likely to remain so fast forward 20 years to the present headlines team with sentiments such as does investing in emerging markets still make sense and is value investing dead it might be and here's what killed it so history is littered with examples of reputable pundits media outlets and prognosticators cautioning investors about broken asset classes typically at the heels of sagging absolute returns or poor results relative to mainstream markets similar warnings also occurred during investment board meetings in his consulting days john recalls back in february 2000 a board meeting of an 800 million pension fund recent market movements namely growth stock outperformance had pushed the fund's asset allocation out of compliance with its investment policy statement requiring a larger balance out of growth stocks into core bonds and small cap value the resistance to the mandated rebalance was unsurprisingly for those who may have lived through this period stiff with one board member stating that small cap value is a dead asset class indeed it appeared the board preferred to eliminate small cap value rather than top it up fortunately the investment policy statement compelled the rebalance to go through and to this day john will tell you it was one of his most rewarding experiences in investment management given the absolute dollar value created for the funds members as growth stocks plunged small value stocks surged and bonds steadily advanced during the bear market that eventually culminated in late 2002 when headlines lead to clients questioning their investment strategy we suggest advisors use comprehensive historical return ranges to most effectively gauge recent results on an absolute basis and relative to a mainstream asset such as u.s equities that is the S&P500 index we will review how seemingly impaired assets are rarely permanently defunct in most cases the performance of a broken asset class is well within its range of historical returns and outperformance often follows a period of underperformance as mean reversion takes hold clients benefit from a greater understanding of the potential long-term upside in recently beaten down assets the broken asset classes before delving into our review let's begin with a few caveats first our selection of broken asset classes is far from exhaustive in making our selection we relied primarily on a global roster of historical articles published in the well-established financial press including businessweek barons the economist and financial times if your own experience includes other asset classes that have been declared broken please let us know second the headlines or conversations that question the long-term viability of an asset class represent just one opinion or voice at that time alongside those who warn and question others may have presented an opposite more favorable view contrarians are often an endangered species but rarely extinct given our survey's purpose is to show how broken asset classes typically mend themselves with time our sample emphasizes the former these are the same troubled asset classes that grab the headlines grip the attention of investors and lead to tough questions for advisors from their clients and finally we are restricted by the availability of return data although we use well-known proxies with an extended return history few asset classes other than u.s stocks and high-yield bonds have a monthly series longer than a half-century a notable example is emerging market stocks in our study we use a return history for em stocks that begins in 1985.""]"
96,95,30,95_confirmation_sma line_sma_strength,"['confirmation', 'sma line', 'sma', 'strength', 'line', 'breakouts', 'higher highs', 'position', 'point', 'entry point']","[""so the next tip is probably one of the best ways in my opinion to boost your profitability overall as well as lower your risk of failed breakouts and that's simply to trade quality patterns quality folks what this means is trade stocks that have a consistent history of making higher highs in quite a smooth way if we are looking at AMD we can see that we are in a consistent up trending pattern with some healthy push backs and knowing this is the long-term trend we look at the shorter chart and pick out entry points for swing trades and that means we look for points where we have confirmation of both directional strength over our red long term directional SMA line as well as our blue price strike short term SMA line we love elevating factors and these are two huge elevating factors in our favor and I do of course want to emphasize the fact that you need to choose the right breakout a lot of folks would look at this uptrend and propose a strategy that involves something like behind in each time it breaks its previous high again this frustrating higher high mentality these breakouts would simply be a point of entry for many traders but this is a dumb strategy and it'll only reward you on perfect up friends like this one yes you could get away with it when I carry pick certain plays like this but in the long run a higher high position a higher high entry point that's the point where it's going to be overextended that's the point where you have a lot of downward potential and that's the point where on average you're more likely to see some depreciation it doesn't mean that it's not going to keep going up after higher highs it just means that you have a lot of deprecating factors so you so you better have your risk management in hand so for the vast majority of cases you should be focusing on breakouts of price strength also known as confirmation the breakouts of higher highs means that we see more running"", ""so first how does buying in at confirmation actually work well let's say we were looking at JD St at this point intraday we see that we are at about fair value on the RSI have just broken into an upper direction over our long term red SMA line and are thus considering taking a position we love buying stocks that are in an upward direction long-term and are also a fair or good deal intraday so it makes sense for us to be scouting out an entry point here and since we have already identified reasons we want to take a position it is now time to wait for the price action to confirm that we were right in our just the ocation and then wonderful boom we have a confirmation with the first candlestick opening above our blue price rank that's Mei Lan so let's say we're taking an entry point here we wouldn't be buying in because we have a hunch or feel like this is the right time but rather because we have this concrete concrete folks concrete entry points so we can take this entry point knowing that this is a period where we have a confirmation of a good position then we can simply write the price strength up and over the SMA line until we have the first validation point aka our first candlestick closing below our price rights SMA line but the fact that we waited for confirmation instead of just impatiently jumping in means that we can measure the price strength using the gap between the SMA line and the price action the wider the gap the stronger the price strength is the smaller the gap the weaker it is pretty intuitive stuff but the reason that this is important is because we have a constant minute-by-minute update on how strong or weak the position is and when it becomes so weak that it breaks its price strength we can simply sell out at validation so that's sort of confirmation 101 find a position you evaluate the position and then you only buy in when you have a confirmation simply never make sense to buy in unless you are confirmed in your thinking you need a confirmation remember we don't trade based on our gut instinct we don't trade based on our emotions and we don't trade based on educated guesses those aren't strategies that's just stupidity we need to be confirmed in our thinking this may sound a little ranty but while I love filming these videos I get a little bit frustrated when people message me"", ""but it ultimately rejected it and moved higher at the next candlestick so we now not only have a price confirmation and an upward directional confirmation but we have a previous history of rejecting redirections downward thus we have strengthened our uptrend and can feel more confident buying in the price action acted accordingly these elevating factors push the price up a lot faster as investors saw that we had broken into an upward direction and thus it created an influx that was largely unsustainable but this was the gimme pad and this was an easy pattern to catch you didn't even have to wait until validation when it comes to price action that runs up in price strength over the SMA line this quickly it's important to bear in mind you could simply watch it reach previous resistance and then hold out until the first show of price weakness that's because once we've crossed previous resistance you're elevating factors have now turned into deprecating factors unless any show of price weakness is now a red flag but when you compare this to the later confirmation we have a confirmation here and then a slow but steady appreciation over our SMA line you could see that you could see the difference between an overhyped run-up and a more subtle easy run and this has a lot to do with the elevated factors behind it at this point we had more elevating factors the deprecating ones thus the move had more power and shot up faster at this point we were already in an upward direction for a while and thus it wasn't super excited to see price appreciation and it rose slower but as a result it was able to maintain that rise and it was easier to trade off of and coincidentally in the situation it provided a more profit potential it actually provided more profit potential over a longer period of time anyways folks the message with this video is always wait for confirmation don't trade based on your emotions and always have a plan when you're trading in the stock market anyways folks I hope this video is useful if you have any questions whatsoever feel free

98,97,29,97_oil_prices_russia_supply,"['oil', 'prices', 'russia', 'supply', 'russian', 'commodity', 'demand', 'strategic', 'capital', 'companies']","[""we need to understand that the game of inflation is a long-term one the decade of inflation that happened in the 70s could very well happen this time around if we don't play our cards right if we do not fix the issue and the imbalance between supply and demand and the monetary stimulus that is kept that demand so high we have doubled the base monetary Supply and that is going to have ramifications when it comes to oil natural gas property prices everything that plays a role in our cost of living now one other important thing to note is that as of last week although we don't have the data just yet as there's a bit of a lag on the data for the U.S strategic petroleum Reserve back on February 17th this is where we last have the data we can see that on the 14th the United States has announced that they're going to continue depleting that petroleum Reserve now I think this is definitely an important step in the short term to get us below that 200 week and to confirm the trend to the downside but again this can only affect oil's price for so long and eventually in order to have that negotiating weight there are periods of time where we're going to likely have to add to the Strategic petroleum Reserve to have that additional weight when we need it most to weigh down prices so again we're going to have to see how this plays out here but either way we only have so much firing power and I think this is a clear sign since back in January that the U.S is trying to test whether or not it needs to deploy that firing power I think if it was going to play it effectively it would have used a bit more in the short term and crush the trend so that the 200 we could start serving as resistance trust me guys things like this do matter when it comes to the overall trend here because you do have investors you do have long-term stakeholders who are preparing and staff backing up energy players like Europe that are trying to counteract this geopolitical tension between Russia which is previously one of its largest providers and producers of oil and natural gas so there is a key Dynamic we need to keep in mind here that but going back here to the topic around crypto right if we don't have inflation done I wanted to go ahead and spend some time to talk about crypto Quant there are data science partner here on the data Dash Channel and on top of that they've got a really great board that you guys can access to for free which you guys can access Down Below in the description where it's got all my favorite data science models that I keep track of there's already hundreds of you checking out the datadash cryptoquan insights dashboard and there are three key charts that I wanted to share with you guys here today all of which for me personally according to history have not shown the even traditional signs of real capitulation any Bitcoin bear market now again I really want to bring this topic back into the conversation we have not seen even the typical corrective or capitulative signs of a traditional Bitcoin bear Market but Bitcoin has never lived through a proper 30 50 recession in equities"", ""well I'm not going to sit here and act like I can predict that and the short term nobody knows and in the short term there is really no floor or ceiling for what commodity prices can do and oil is absolutely no exception but in the long term there are a few things that I think are worth sharing now there's some really good research I kind of stumbled across from a guy called Gary Turner who is the CEO of Trove research and he published a really interesting study on basically Returns on equity and Returns on invested capital and Renewables and and oil companies and how that changes at different oil prices now the US is the largest producer of oil in the world and the Returns on equity and Returns on invested Capital that the companies and then you know of course the returns that investors can generate are going to be heavily dependent on the price of oil as Warren Buffett has just told us and uh This research from uh Gary Turner suggests that if oil were to stabilize in the 40 to 60 dollar Barrel range then the typical large U.S oil company would only earn about a four percent return on Capital and within that 40 to 60 dollar range those Returns on investor Capital actually changed quite dramatically uh at sixty dollar oil the average large U.S oil and gas company would earn about an eight percent return on invested capital and at forty dollar oil they would earn about a 1.3 return on invested Capital so all of that is to say that if oil were to get below say forty to sixty dollars a barrel in the very long term the US basically doesn't have a sustainable oil industry the returns will be too anemic to Warrant you know new Investments so that sort of puts potentially a longer term flaw on oil prices and you would think that over time the cost of production for oil will tend to go up we have that just through General inflation and asset prices and labor prices going up but we also have that through sort of the physical reality ways of finding oil you know all the easy oil has largely been sucked out of the ground already and oil companies are having to get sort of increasingly heroic and go further distances and so on to find new oil now in terms of a potential sealing price or upper limit for where Oil could go to there's a pretty famous saying in commodity businesses that the cure to high prices is high prices and that basically means that as commodity prices go up and companies start earning very high sort of super normal Returns on Capital that tends to encourage more people to produce that particular commodity and earn those super high Returns on Capital and that of course pushes prices back down again if it gets too extreme you have sort of the marginal producers of a particular commodity kind of pull back and restrain production and that's how you have these Epson flows and commodity prices over time but there are a few things that are potentially different this time and I know that is the most dangerous phrase and invest in but you have this very kind of political situation where producing more oil is very very frowned upon and you also have an investor base that is really demanding a capital return through dividends or BuyBacks having been burnt in a recent cycle add to that the fact again that oil will without doubt get harder to find over time I really don't know what the cln 2 oil prices could be now to sum up Buffett's investment case at an Occidental and Chevron I actually think it's very simple there's a lot of moving Parts here but I think there are really two core drivers behind this investment from Buffett firstly I think he probably has a view that long-term oil prices will be higher and they'll be higher for longer than most investors probably anticipate in many ways there is the structural mismatch between oil supply and oil demand and if those two things that I just said turn out to be correct they can really only mean one thing for oil prices which is that they have to go up the second thing that I think Buffett likes is that there is very little capital expenditure for growth he's getting a lot of his cash back very quickly through dividends and BuyBacks particularly when oil prices are as high as they have been recently oils come back a little bit in the past month but you know if we look at just the sheer amount of cash flow that companies like Occidental have been producing it's been pretty insane I mean oxy produced 4.2 billion dollars of free cash flow in their second quarter this year which is a six percent free cash flow yield just from that one quarters cash flow they also retired 4.8 billion in debt and purchase back 1.1 billion of stock"", ""so you're asking oil companies to further lower what makes you think that they are going to listen to an Administration that is ultimately trying to put them out of business how how is the administration trying to put them out of business well they produce fossil fuels and this President says he wants to end fossil fuel so look there's a couple of other things at play in terms of the investors and these oil companies firstly we've come out of a couple of really interesting phases of the oil cycle in 2007 and eight the last time that oil companies really rocketed up and oil prices were very high there was a lot of incentive for oil companies to grow and to deploy capital and finding more oil and that really caused quite a significant oversupply in the oil Market it meant that oil prices went down and really there were a lot of investors burned from encouraging companies to go through that exercise so there's been a real shift and if you listen to the likes of the Occidental quarterly conference calls you'll no longer hear them talking a lot about finding new oil and spending a lot of money on Capital expenditures to drill more Wells and so on uh you'll instead hear them talking a lot about debt repayment about sheer BuyBacks and about paying dividends to shareholders and finally there's some research that I covered in a previous video here on the channel that suggests that over the very long term if oil were to get below the say 40 to 60 dollar per barrel range it would really no longer be economic for most oil companies to exist so anything can happen in the short term with all sorts of commodity prices but that probably is some sort of very long-term floor for oil so to sum up where I think Buffett's head is probably out if I really had to guess I think there's probably two core factors really at play when he's investing in the likes of Occidental and Chevron I think firstly he probably has a view that oil prices stay higher for longer than most people anticipate and secondly I think he really likes the capital allocation taking place at these companies limited capital expenditure for growth and exploration and a lot of cash being funneled back towards shareholders through debt repayments dividends and share BuyBacks and to an extent I think that second capital allocation points probably reinforces the first point of oil prices Staying High if every company is just doing a bunch of sheer BuyBacks and paying dividends and no one's spending money on looking for new oil that is another kind of big constraint over the long term on oil supply now I recently actually got the chance to sit down and interview Jake Taylor who some of you may know from the value after hours podcast he's also the CEO of Farnam Street Investments and the author of The Rebel allocator the full podcast episode with Jake will be going live probably later this week on the investing with Tom podcast YouTube channel on and on all audio platforms as well and I just want to play a clip of something that Jake said in that podcast episode really exactly on some of the points I've been discussing in this video like I'm very hopeful that Humanity will make the transition from hydrocarbons to more renewable sources of energy and I think we will get there eventually I just think it's going to take a long time and as an investor if everyone thinks it's going to take a short time and you think it's going to take longer that that has often been a pretty good bet to make is that things take longer than than everyone thinks now we all know that Warren Buffett is a value investor anytime he's looking to buy into a particular company and oil is no exception he's looking to buy that business below its intrinsic value and he actually mentioned specifically in the 2007 annual shareholder meeting for Birch Hathaway uh how he thinks about investing in oil companies he said if we are in an oil stock it's because we think it offers a lot of value at this price but it does not mean we think the price of oil is going up if we thought oil was going up we could buy oil Futures which we actually did once so how exactly does Warren Buffett calculate something like intrinsic value for an oil company because these businesses are very different from a apple or Microsoft or Costco which a very steady businesses that produce stable and growing amounts of cash flow and earnings oil companies are quite different they can be very very volatile and the earnings year to year are heavily influenced by the price of oil again I want to play another clip here from my interview with Jake Taylor where he presents a pretty nice idea of thinking about valuation with some of these very cyclical businesses I think I ideally in a in like that type of commodity company you would you probably like Buy on Price to Book and sell on PE so wait until you buy when the business isn't working assuming that you know that it's it's a cyclical Decline and not a secular Decline and that that is not always obvious uh so as you know a lot of people could attest to buying companies that they thought were just at a temporary dip""]"

here I know I used stressed a lot for examples but the main lesson I want to drive in here is that you cannot just simply buy things at a low there are crypto currencies in the space that in the next year or so will be irrelevant I can't give you a specific number but the main thing I want you to really kind of hone into your mind is that around 90 to 95 percent of all crypto currencies you see right now trading for relatively high valuations are going to die out in a year to five years it's just the truth it's the reason why I ice tried it to tell you all diversification is necessary in crypto currencies and that you simply cannot just buy something low and think oh don't worry I don't have to set a stoploss I can just simply buy something and not have to worry about it because I'm buying it on the low end and all crypto goes up that's not right that's excessively off course of a true investor you have to understand that we are living in something very similar to duck on the.com level and so something that the the Nasdaq experienced back in the early the sorry the late nineties to early 2000s and we'll take a look at it right now now you might look at this chart and say oh wow that looks like the total like cryptocurrency market valuation kind of what we're going through right now now of course I think crypto currencies have a ways to go but the dot-com era was when internet first came out it was when internet really started to see we started to see some potential in the internet we started seeing websites popping up and people really engaging with personal computers the same things going on with cryptocurrency right now there's a lot of excitement and a lot of FOMO to get into the general industry not only investing but also creating new icos creating new blockchain projects that are getting valued at tens hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions so we have to consider the fact that usually what you know can come up like this can come crashing down as well because a lot of the companies that came up during this time in the Nasdaq that came up during the dot-com bubble were companies that weren't even profitable they weren't practical and they had no real value proposition I can give you an example story I always loved this one another course there's like the standard ones like pets.com and a few other ones like that but the one that I was liked and I can't think of the name of the company"", ""let's just say for the sake of our example rates will go back up we're gonna see lots of on-chain activity we're gonna have eight percent once again being the norm for ethereum mistaking well then in that situation you can make some sweet yields off a stake in your eat that eight percent of course is paid out in eth and not in dollars like the bond example that we just gave so it means that you can either sell your eth straight away for cash in order to realize those gains lock in the ROI or you can play the markets hold the eth and sell it at the next cycle obviously in hopes of doing that for more money that can easily amplify your gains potential here now I'll break down the math in a moment but first how risky is staking your ethereum well staking ethereum is pretty low risk by crypto standards however there are a few things to consider if you're using a staking provider do keep in mind that well they can get hacked that can happen even if it's unlikely it's also something to keep in mind that if you are self-staking well self-staking can actually result in losses too via things like slashing which can result in a big loss of funds so it's not super risk-free but low risk and what about Capital allocation well to earn ten thousand dollars a month at the current prices and assuming a higher staking rate than is currently available at 8.8 percent then you would need about 1 0.5 million dollars invested we're about 8 000 eighth which will earn you about 64 eth per year soon at higher staking right now if however the price of eath were to reach say ten thousand dollars per coin next Bull Run than the ROI on that staking would be more like 40 percent but even with such Moon math it would actually require about three hundred thousand dollars invested in order to get that 10K per month Target assuming you know you're cashing out later when the prices are higher still a lot of money by any standard number three low caps now this is not something that's easy to do at scale because liquidity is often very low on these but every month we see low cap coins put in massive gains coins like radiant Capital labor Finance you know it's funny"", ""so once you've estimated how high and how long cryptos on your list could pump in response to upcoming events and announcements the next steps are to decide how much to allocate and when to take profits it should go without saying that going all in on a crypto you think is going to pump is a very bad idea this is because there is no guarantee that the pump will play out exactly as you projected it could start earlier or later last longer or shorter go higher or even go down in response to the news you're banking on in a worst case scenario your investment could go to zero and though you've heard this about crypto before it's especially applicable in this case that's because it's safe to say that big cryptos like bitcoin are here to stay but the same can't be said for many of the altcoins you'll inevitably end up holding as part of your mission to the moon as such it's wise to put down only what you're willing to lose not only will this help minimize your losses but it will also make cashing out easier if or when the gains start to come in that's because it's really hard to take profits if you have a huge allocation and prices are going parabolic reducing your exposure will make it easier to abide by a risk-off profit-taking strategy as i mentioned in my video about my personal crypto trading strategy the irrationality of the market often means that any sort of logical analysis doesn't work when prices really start to pump that's why i personally take profits based on the percentage gains i have rather than any psychologically comfortable price points or price targets revealed by ta more importantly i tend to keep some of my coins and tokens in the race in case the rally continues this can and often does happen especially when market euphoria is at an all-time high on that note it's worth quickly pointing out that smaller altcoins don't always care about what the rest of the crypto market is doing all coins almost always follow bitcoin's lead but there have been many instances of altcoins continuing to pump even as the rest of the market carries on dumping even so it's important to be aware of what the rest of the market is doing and factor that into your measurements allocations and profit taking strategies if we're bleeding red across the board you might want to reduce the height and length of any pumps you're predicting reduce your allocations and lower your cash out expectations in the short term once you've decided how much to allocate and when to take profits for the cryptos on your pump list the last step is to consider whether any of those cryptos has some serious longer longer-term potential chances are you'll come across a couple of these during your crypto quest and you'll know you've found a winner when you see some most or all of the following features first and foremost there's a use case or utility for the coin or token that creates constant demand for it this is because the constant buying pressure should increase its price over time second the coin or token is listed on a few reputable exchanges like kucoin and binance but has yet to list on any u.s exchanges like coinbase kraken or gemini this is because most of the money flowing into crypto is coming from the united states and as regulators continue to crack down on offshore exchanges more of this capital is staying on u.s exchanges the thing to keep in mind here is that the cryptocurrency you think has long-term potential could be too similar to a security i.e a stock in a company to us regulators this means u.s cryptocurrency exchanges won't be able to list that coin or token now you can familiarize yourself with the criteria currently used to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security or not by watching my video about the ripple versus sec lawsuit in the description the third feature of a crypto with long-term potential is lots of partnerships with popular crypto projects and protocols this is because the future of cryptocurrency is interoperability and if a crypto project has made little to no effort to cooperate and integrate with its competitors it will have a hard time flourishing in the future the fourth feature of a crypto with long-term potential is lots of vc funding assuming this vc funding comes after the cryptocurrency's main net has launched already as i mentioned in my video about the most funded crypto projects this is because any investments made by vc's post main net are a strong sign that the project is legit and still has a lot of potential the fifth feature of a crypto with long-term potential is constant development and innovation this is because the crypto space is insanely competitive and a failure to evolve can be fatal for a project the last feature of a crypto with long-term potential ties into the fifth and that's the absence of any serious competition within that cryptos niche this is because a monopoly on a certain technology or use case is insanely profitable as proven by chain link which dominates cryptocurrency's oracle niche now these are just a few of the features that define a crypto project with long-term potential and you can learn about the others by watching my video on how to find promising altcoins it's up there in the top right they say you can't predict a crypto pump but recently i found that these pumps usually have many of the same characteristics this methodology can be summed up in a single sentence and that's to pay very close attention to what's going on in cryptocurrency and be honest with yourself about what you see and what it means i personally don't chase pumps mainly because i don't think it's a sustainable long-term investment strategy i prefer to stick to huddling and swing trading cryptocurrencies i believe to be legit because there's more to life than chasing pumps and crying over dumps having said that it is interesting to go digging through the lower levels of the coin market cap leaderboards every now and then and observing some of the crazy price action in those low-cap altcoins which one could be next that's my two cents for you today folks if you enjoyed the video be sure to give that like a spike remember to subscribe to the channel and ping that notification bell if you want to keep getting quality crypto content with minimal hype now a lot of you have been asking me if i could cover urgent topics in a timelier manner""]"
101,100,28,100_real estate_estate_portfolio_real,"['real estate', 'estate', 'portfolio', 'real', 'investment', 'estate investing', 'real estate investing', 'advanced', 'fees', 'plans']","[""A lot of these different sites out there for crowdfunded real estate have different structures, and a lot of them are not very transparent about the fees they are charging. So, I really like Fundrise because they tell you flat out what your fees are, and they're also not burying it in the fifth page of some document. Right on the homepage of your portfolio you can see your returns to date, and down here it shows you what you've earned from dividends, what you've earned from asset appreciation, and exactly how much money you paid in advisory fees. So, they're very transparent about that fee structure. And obviously guys looking at my performance here, these returns are what I actually earned after I paid that 1% fee to Fundrise. So, anyways guys that's gonna wrap up this portfolio update here. Let me know down in the Comment section below if you want to see me do a quarterly update of this portfolio, or how often you guys want me to update you on the balance and the growth of this portfolio."", ""You know, it kind of protects you from you because you can't just pull your money out. And the reason is because your money is collectively with everyone else's being put into real estate, which is a low liquidity investment. So you can't just throw your money in and take it back out. If you do, you are going to pay redemption fees. So understand that Fundrise is a five year plus low liquidity investment. All right, so moving on now let's talk about the different Fundrise plans that they offer and the corresponding minimums. Well, they did change this recently. We have new plans over here called advanced and premium, but the same plans over here are still the same. So first of all, we have the starter portfolio, which has a minimum investment of just $500, which is essentially for those who want to give it a shot, try out Fundrise without committing tons of money. Then they have the advanced plans where there are three different ones and those have a minimum investment of $1,000. Now the good news is at any time you can upgrade from the starter portfolio to the Advanced plan."", ""So pretty much with the advanced plans, you're picking one of them three portfolios, but once you have over $10,000 invested, you can choose a more specific strategy and kind of be more zeroed in with your investments. Even though I have over 10,000, I still just have my money in the balanced portfolio. That's what works well for me. And lastly, if you have a hundred thousand dollars or more, you're going to have premium account access. And as far as the benefits of that, this is going to give you a priority, customer service and the option to schedule a call with a Fundrise expert to basically talk about your investments and the platform overall. So for most people, they're gonna fall in into the $500 plan for the starter or one of the advanced plans, because at the end of the day, Fundrise is meant to be a platform for many smaller investors to get in on private real estate deals. But that being said, if you wanna do a more sizable investment, you can get into the advanced plan and pick a more specific strategy.""]"

Market timing is hard, which is why so few people are able to do it and make money consistently. Add to that the seedy elements of penny stocks, and it becomes even harder to make money. The world of penny stocks is rife with speculation and hearsay, and these stocks tend to move more on buzz than on core business fundamentals. That\'s because penny stocks are generally smaller, less established companies that have market caps, or total business value, of less than $100 million, and shares priced below $5. They often trade OTC, or over the counter, meaning they aren\'t traded on major exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. This means that the companies don\'t have to go through the more rigorous reporting requirements established by these major exchanges, and that shares are less liquid. Liquidity is kind of a squishy concept, but basically, a less liquid stock will move more dramatically when any one person tries to buy or sell it.', ""so to start the first line of criteria is abnormal volume now for the newbies in the room volume is simply the number of shares being traded at any given period and it's indicated here on the chart this is important for example because if we were looking at a recent runner we could see dismal volume and then BOOM huge abnormal volume and understanding how to utilize volume is key to understanding when a penny stock is about to spike of course I should mention that there is a huge stigma around low volume penny stocks every single time that I make a top penny stocks video someone will comment and message me saying that I'm stupid and I should never recommend low volume penny stocks but to allow me to be crystal clear I would never recommend buying a stock if it does not have enough volume because then you won't have the liquidity required to enter and exit a position it's as simple as that but the thing is that with many of these penny stocks like be me will have periods where the volume is too low there's not enough liquidity but then all of a sudden when the catalyst happens the volume increases rapidly and that gives us the opportunity to trade off the price action and that's why you can't just discount stocks because they have volume anything you should be watching stocks that have low volume for outbreaks of volume but what that being said when a stock has a massive influx of shares being traded that means that we are going to have more fluctuation we love love love fluctuation and in the case of be me that was a huge factor helping to contribute to the run-up""]"

active devs joined just last year the catch is that 50 of monthly active devs only commit one to ten days per month now some may take this as a sign that they're being lazy which is perhaps to be expected given the current crypto Market condition Editions the authors however are more optimistic they assume devs who only commit one to ten days per month are part-time workers conversely devs who work 10 to 28 days a month are assumed to be full-time part-time and full-time devs currently have roughly 500k monthly code commits naturally full-time devs are contributing The Lion's Share at over 350k commits per month the remaining commits come from part-time devs who come and go as crypto prices rise and fall interestingly the number of part-time and full-time devs both increased by roughly 8 percent in 2022 the all-time high for Dev activity was in June last year at over 26k this is likewise interesting because it was shortly after Terror collapsed I wonder if this is because crypto Debs was scrambling to make sure their crypto projects were completely disconnected from terra's ecosystem more about what happened to Terra in the description now considering that the crypto industry apparently added 60k devs last year this begs the question of why there are only around 23k monthly active devs now the authors reveal it's because the 40K or so devs who left were part-timers or those who had only contributed crypto code once as I mentioned earlier only 28 of these 23k devs are working on bitcoin and ethereum this percentage has also been constant in recent years meanwhile the percentage of devs working on the top 200 crypto ecosystems by value has grown and 72 percent of devs are now working there this ties into the second part of the report which gives an overview of Dev activity in the largest crypto ecosystems by value starting of course with Bitcoin and ethereum this image shows you what the authors mean by crypto ecosystem using ethereum's optimism layer 2 as an example now although the number of Bitcoin devs has grown over the years it remained flat at around 900 in 2022 bitcoin's Dev growth has also been relatively slow with only 100 added to its ecosystem since 2017."", ""this is down from a high of over four and a half thousand which was hit last January they highlight the fact that this growth is a 2.5 X increase compared to the D5 summer of 2020 when the niche became popular now when it comes to defy ecosystems outside of ethereum the authors make it clear that there wasn't nearly as much activity Cosmos D5 was in second place with only around 500 devs significantly fewer than ethereum Solana D5 was in third with just under 400 devs to be fair not that bad all in all then 50 of defy devs are working in ethereum's ecosystem with the remainder working on other competing smart contract cryptocurrencies now this might sound disheartening if you're a fan of the competitors but you should know that ethereum's defy Dev dominance fell from 70 in 2020 as for nft devs there are only around 900 scattered across the crypto ecosystem this is down from a high of almost 1200 early last year oddly enough the number of nft devs hasn't really declined over the last year by contrast the number of defy devs declined by almost 10 percent further investigation by the authors found that the stable count of nft devs is due to the fact that an increasing number of part-time nft devs offset the number of full-time and one-time devs who left I suspect these devs are associated with all those big Brands launching nfts so this brings me to the big question and that's what the findings of electric capital's crypto Dev report mean for the crypto Market well for starters it suggests that crypto is truly here to stay it's too soon to say whether all the devs that were gained will remain but I bet most of them will it also suggests that crypto projects with lots of funding have been the least affected by the bear Market this includes existing Blue Chip crypto projects like polygon Solana and near protocol it also includes potentially future Blue Chip crypto projects like Aptos and sui the descendants of Facebook's Libra however there are exceptions to this rule like polkadot and Cosmos if you watched our video comparing both crypto projects you'll know they're actually surprisingly similar now the ability to continue building a Dev base despite having significantly less funding is another quality both projects share call me crazy"", ""the total number of Terra devs currently stands at around 70 and appears to be in an uptrend I suppose dokwon got the gang back together in Serbia or wherever Jokes Aside more than 50 percent of terror's pre-crash devs threw in the towel after Luna and UST went to zero the other 45 or so went to other crypto ecosystems with a third going to Cosmos a third going to Terror 2.0 and the final third going to unspecified crypto ecosystems then after comparing current crypto Dev metrics against those from the 2018 crypto bear Market the authors present this amazing picture it shows you the growth in full-time devs that's full time for different crypto ecosystems over time from when the first code commit was published to GitHub the picture is a bit messy but it's clear that polka dots growth has been very impressive and by that I mean its Dev count has grown faster than ethereums did when it was getting started polkadot also seems to be the only crypto project that's managed to maintain a larger growth rate than ethereums the authors then zoom in on newer crypto projects and protocols this is where start net which is again arguably part of ethereum Aptos and the BNB chain Reigns Supreme unfortunately development on the BNB chain has since stalled and the correlation appears to be very close to crypto prices the authors go on to underscore the fact that 37 of crypto ecosystems with more than 50 full-time devs are leveraging the ethereum virtual machine or evm for smart contracts these numbers are debatable because as we've seen many of these evm projects belong in ethereum's ecosystem it looks like the reason why the authors insist on segregating these ethereum projects into their own ecosystems is because their own analysis suggests that most evm devs stick to a single evm chain this flies in the face of the popular narrative that evm devs copy and paste from ethereum if I understand correctly projects on ethereum's polygon side chain are the least likely to be copy and pasted to other evm chains this makes sense considering that polygon is basically a copy of ethereum that is extremely fast and the polygon itself provides lots of funding to projects that commit to it more about polygon in the description now on the other side of the spectrum you have Avalanche whose projects have seen the most deployments to other evm chains this again makes sense because avalanche's ecosystem had the most exposure to Terror this includes the Avalanche Foundation itself which lost a lot when Terror collapsed evm projects that have deployed to other evm chains have overwhelmingly chosen optimism and arbitrum as their number one destinations this makes sense considering that both layer twos will soon be seeing a massive scalability upgrade when ethereum introduces dank sharding sometime in the summer in the third part of the report the authors touch on popular crypto use cases now this section focuses a lot on ethereum and it starts with the authors showcasing the ethereum dapps that have generated the most fees these are the openc nft marketplace the uni swap decks and tethers usdt stablecoin based on these top contracts the authors conclude that nfts and defy are the most popular use cases in cryptocurrency at the moment this might sound like a biased assessment but remember that we're talking about 2022 here other smart contract cryptocurrencies didn't see that much activity anyways the authors reveal that there are almost 4 000 D5 focused devs as of December 2022.""]"

had a comment yesterday on my video from yesterday I was talking about a head and shoulders that we've been tracking and Kyle G said what about the inverse head and shoulders forming after your head prediction of the head and shoulders this would put us at the right shoulder of this inverse Head & Shoulders pattern right now with a target of 8600 let me know if you see this we just got a pump it was a it's a really good observation I love tracking Head & Shoulders confluent with inverse Head & Shoulders especially when Bitcoin is in kind of this falling wedge so there's so many different patterns going on there's so many different targets many of them kind of lining up with each other and it's very exciting for me when I'm doing technical analysis to watch these things so first off I just want to show you Bitcoin the head and shoulders that we've been watching right on Bitcoin is here this is a left shoulder we have a head we have this right shoulder"", ""I want you to notice something right now we're forming what is known as a bull flag this bull flag has a downtrend level of resistance right here and a downtrending level of support right here if we just go ahead and draw the flagpole right here and then extrapolate this flagpole then we can see that Bitcoin has a price target of 85 000 probably sometime towards the end of November which would actually match up with plan B's price prediction of 98 000 by the end of November I think that he is going to be more than likely correct but if we look down to the four hourly chart something else interesting is happening remember how we talked about the fact that there is a head and shoulders pattern here with a price Target at 53 000 well it looks like the bottom might be in and if it is then this price target for this head and shoulders pattern may not play out but the interesting thing is over the last one over the last 12 to 24 hours we have started to implement a inverse Head and Shoulders pattern with the left shoulder right here a right shoulder right here and a head right here this inverse Head and Shoulders pattern has a neckline right here and this neckline at 63 600 dollars gives us a price Target based on this head sitting all the way up here as you can see at sixty nine thousand five hundred dollars let's call it just five uh seventy thousand dollars for Simplicity so both of these price targets give us a major rally in the next month or so"", ""and I will see you on the other side let's go [Music] welcome back guys let's go ahead and get started with this breakdown on Bitcoin so the reason we're expecting a possible move up is because of an age-old price action pattern that if you're familiar with the Head & Shoulders pattern you probably have already spotted and as you can see this just goes to prove guys that cryptocurrency applies by the same rules as all other financial markets guys it's based on human psychology we're thinking the same way whether we're investing in trading in Bitcoin in crypto currencies in forex or even in the stock market it's all gonna be based around the same human psychology now just the fact that we have a head and shoulders pattern here that doesn't necessarily mean that we're gonna see a huge move in price action doesn't necessarily mean that we're gonna see some kind of big reversal just having a head and shoulders pattern is not quite enough to anticipate some kind of huge move out of a market now what's different about this Bitcoin chart than just a head and shoulders pattern well this head and shoulders pattern happened to come in right at a previous level of major structure so if you've been a part of the trading channel at all or seen a few of our videos you know that we trade around major levels of structure quite often and here on Bitcoin you can see that the market is currently at a level of structure that's been tested multiple times this is something we use to spot out major levels of structure as you can see here we have resistance we have this market using this level of support right here using it as support again right here and of course bouncing off a couple of times here for this head and shoulders pattern now with all of that being the case and the market putting in this Head and Shoulders pattern right here at this level that gives us reason to believe that we could possibly see a reversal out of Bitcoin and another leg up now before we talk about some of the different ways there are to take advantage of the next leg up here on Bitcoin there's something else that's extremely important even more important than technical analysis that I'd like to discuss and this guy's is something that most traders either fail to do or fail to realize before it's too late and they blow their entire account the way I want to start this off is by saying that if you're brand new to trading brand new to investing for yourself and brand new to financial markets cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market is probably one of the worst markets for you to start in in all honesty and that's the case because of multiple reasons that we won't get into right here because that would make for an extremely long video but the point being if you don't understand the key aspects of trading that go beyond technical analysis or that go beyond someone from a chat forum saying they believe bitcoins gonna go up then you're gonna have a really difficult time being profitable or making money in any financial market making a huge return on your investment it's possible over a long period of time but is almost impossible when it comes to making it in a very short period of time and so some of the things that help you to make consistent profits over time is understanding these aspects we're about to discuss and before we even get started discussing the aspects that I'm gonna talk about the first thing I wanna do is give you guys an analogy because a lot of traders believe that they can just go from knowing absolutely nothing about markets which might be where you're at right now to trading and cryptocurrency trading & forex or trading in the stock market and let me explain to you guys why that's not necessarily the best idea and that is actually a huge contributing factor to why most traders fail I'm gonna do this with an analogy so let's imagine that you're in need of having your kidney removed and now let's imagine that you have two different options option a is a doctor who has been through an applicable University studied all the material necessary to know how to remove a kidney or do surgery and also has done this type of surgery on dummies before as practice that's option a now option B is somebody literally off the street that's never even looked at a college textbook for becoming a doctor and that is obviously never performed surgery before or practiced which one would you choose would you choose option A someone with knowledge and experience or option B someone off the street that has no knowledge or experience in removing a kidney now at this point you should have thought to yourself option a of course""]"

downside here there's a downside versus upside and the short term for sure the downside is way higher than what your upside potential can be here especially when those ecosystem tokens unlock and the seed and the precede so these are the type of things you always want to find out what's unlocking what is the percentage between investors and you know seed launch pad team treasury project development but you also want to go in and see like you know even if after this dip it dips like after the unlock it dips there's still eighty percent of the tokens to unlock here for example so there's a lot of downside of risk with projects with these types of tokenomics now it makes complete sense we were set up in this industry not not a setup in a bad way they set us up uh axi infinity you know they set the staple into space and they set the staple of how tokenomics are and a lot of projects copied their tokenomics so you know things to look like really red flags red flags burn mechanisms burn mechanisms number one red flag if you have a burn mechanism on your token unless it is because it's its own blockchain and it is burning its token on its own blockchain Avalanche polygon ethereum every blockchain that you can use on metamask for example unless it is just strictly burning its own token using it for gas not some weird every time they sell X tokens we burn this amount of tokens to keep the ecosystem stable"", ""and we're seeing the investors are getting tons and tons and tons of IMX tokens over the next couple of years and even GameStop who received an IMX Grant they dumped every single token it's just not a very strong uh outlook for the tokenomics for the schedule of the unlocks so like on the website you see token sales public and private are only 19 but the problem with that is is that 19 is a first of all accounting for two billion tokens that's a lot of capital A lot of liquidity that's in that 20 and then second of all it's unlocking every single month here Robbie and the team are doing everything possible to kind of prevent the dumps trying to lock up tokens in the ecosystem and stuff like that but at the end of the day when you redistribute it to investors they can do what they want it's an open market and as mentioned it's a bear Market a lot of people want to secure liquidity in these time periods to be able to then accumulate at their levels of DCA Comfort whatever it is so that's just one example always check out the white list always check out the distributions because the schedule of release is so much more important than like this for example obviously great at 50 is going to ecosystem development but we've also seen the developer grants that can be dumped from that right you have to read between the fine lines always check out the white paper and look at the distribution schedules and how can you find more about distribution schedules without really digging not deep into every single white paper head over to token.unlocks.app and you'll actually be able to see all the upcoming unlocks in the space this is an incredible incredible platform to use to see what unlocks are around the corner you know when you can look for potential either a dips in tokens where you can then accumulate at a better price if the unlocks are slowing down Etc or if you're like a Trader most the time these are really good opportunities potentially for short traders in the market whenever you get a good unlock on a huge project most the time there is a bit of a dip we saw it play out with axi last month we're seeing it potentially play out we saw it layout with imx's last unlock and we potentially could see it play out once again but this is a great tracker to be able to actually go in here and check those things and it puts it in one central location"", ""I think a big but also Fair prediction is that the token could reach 5 billion dollars in market cap this would give the token a value of four

109,108,27,108_ratio_pe_pe ratio_earnings,"['ratio', 'pe', 'pe ratio', 'earnings', 'book', 'price book', 'company', 'business', 'price earnings', 'earnings share']","[""so long story short the higher the p ratio is the more that people are paying for the current earnings of the business and the pe ratio is very widely used if you look up pretty much any stock uh almost on any sort of platform whether that be just a simple google search of a particular stock or whether you look a business up on something like yahoo finance or msn money or whichever other service you might be using uh you can pretty much always get a p e ratio for that business as one of the first stats that's presented to you now there are a couple of situations where you actually won't see a pe ratio certainly the most common is if the business doesn't have any earnings or if they are losing money so if you see a business with no pay ratio listed that probably means that the business isn't earning money if you have negative earnings it's very hard to calculate a p e ratio the other thing you might see is maybe a negative pe basically means the same thing the business is not earning money now again something like a p e ratio does not completely replace an overall intrinsic value calculation something that has a high p ratio may be expensive compared to today's earnings but that business may be set up to grow very fast out into the future and it can very quickly grow into that p e ratio but if you have a stock that is trading at a very low p e ratio it may not exactly be cheap either because that business may have declining earnings over time which if the price stays steady and the earnings are going down that means the pe ratio will actually go up over time which is sort of the reverse of what might happen with a growing companies so in terms of how i use this personally there are basically two main things that are really i'm screening out so i'm not typically using a pe ratio to say yes i'm going to invest in this company it's usually the reverse it's usually a quick way of eliminating businesses and saying that i'm really not interested at them um at this price it's really not worth me doing any more digging into this company because it's unlikely that i'm going to be able to get my heat around the valuation or it's unlikely that i'm going to be able to get behind with any degree of confidence some of the growth expectations that might be built into a particular company so the first number that might come up in a p e ratio that will have me pretty much completely ignoring that business and moving on to something else is if it has no p e ratio or if the p e ratio is negative either that company is not earning money or it's losing money and then reporting a negative p ratio that is pretty much always an instant pass for me i'm generally looking at profitable profitable businesses and businesses that are reasonably predictable over time as well"", ""and basically they are generally influenced by things like how much debt that particular company has so if we add back the interest payment and we add back the tax uh we basically have a way of comparing the profitability of different businesses regardless of how well financed they are so regardless of whether they have no debt or a little bit of debt or a moderate amount of debt or a lot of debt uh we can compare companies on sort of an equal basis so that if an acquirer were to go into that company and just buy out the whole thing and pay off all the debts and you know pocket the cash or whatever it might be uh all businesses are on an even playing field if we use ebit as opposed to earnings now i would be remiss not to say that if you go too far down this track of modifying earnings and using things like ebitda especially uh our boy charlie munger back here will start to uh call that out as profit because that has taken away some very real costs through depreciation especially uh but ebit is a very useful metric like i say to compare the profitability of different companies uh regardless of their financing structure and again just like a pe ratio the higher that number the higher the price people are paying for the current earnings of that business or the current ebit of that business and the lower the number the lower the price that people are paying for the current ebit of that business but we're also in this case factoring in some of the balance sheet stats so if you have two businesses that have the same ebit and the same market cap for example you will tend to see a lower eve bit if the company has more cash and less debt and you'll see a higher eve bit if they have more debt and less cash so incorporate some of those balance sheet numbers and it's a really useful way to incorporate that overall sort of financial statement analysis into a simple easy to use metric so there you have it those are the three metrics that i probably use most commonly as a initial screen to get a feel for whether a business might be cheaper expensive uh the p e ratio the price to book ratio and the acquirer's multiple ev2 ebit again none of those metrics on their own replace a full discounted cash flow or intrinsic value calculation but they are a great starting point to very quickly screen out businesses that are just going to be way too expensive or find businesses that might be worth further investigation and doing a bit more digging so i do hope you enjoyed that video and learned something from it if you're interested in the hatch offer you will need to go to the link hatch dot a s forward slash investing on tom"", ""we're going to talk about is the price to book ratio and the price to book ratio is again a fairly easy to get kind of metric for most companies if you look up a business on something like yahoo finance search the stock ticker and look up some key statistics you'll pretty much always see a price to book ratio and this is one of those metrics that is really really useful for some businesses and not so useful for other businesses so let's first describe what the price to book ratio is again just like the p e ratio we have a price factor and we're dividing that by some other number in this case book value now book value is simply the assets of the company minus any of the liabilities so if the business owns a bunch of buildings and a bunch of intellectual property for example those are all assets if they have some long-term debt then that would be a liability so you take the assets you take away the debt and the kind of net amount that equity that you are left with is what's called book value in accounting terms so when you look at a price to book ratio if you see a price to book ratio of less than one you're basically seeing a business that is trading for less than that book value uh you can buy it for half of sort of the net worth of that company for example if the book value was 0.5 or if the book value was something like 3 for example you're paying many multiples of sort of the net worth that is built into the balance sheet of that company now like i said earlier there are some businesses where the price to book ratio is really useful and other businesses where the price to book ratio is really a complete waste of time and it basically comes down to looking at how that particular company earns money now if the business is in some sort of industry where the amount of assets that that company has basically directly controls the amount of income and earnings that that business generates that's a situation where the price to book ratio can be quite useful so a classic example here is something like a real estate business now a real estate businesses income is basically entirely driven by how much real estate the company has there's really no way that a real estate company can go ahead and earn a really dramatically higher amount of income without increasing the asset value in its portfolio increasing the book value in that company so things like real estate companies things like farms things like banks or insurance companies those are all industries where the assets of the company hugely dictate the amount of money that those businesses can earn and for that reason the price to book ratio is a metric that's really useful when you're analyzing those companies at least on a surface level before you do a deep dive into some of those companies so if you come across a real estate company for example or a bank or insurance company and you see that the price to book ratio is well below one it's trading at far less than the book value or the uh equity value of that company then that is something that may be of more interest to you and something that is potentially undervalued but there are a wide range of businesses where the amount of assets that they have does not necessarily dictate how profitable those companies are going to be and these are companies that can quite rationally be priced at many multiples of their book value so a company like apple for example comes to mind apple can increase their profitability by selling new services or increasing the price of their iphones or selling more iphone units are really without spending a whole bunch of money on creating new assets so apple coca-cola microsoft any business that really is brand heavy and produces a large amount of money on a relatively small asset base those are the types of businesses where the price to book ratio is really not particularly useful uh as the businesses profitability is really not dictated by the amount of assets that are sort of on that company's balance sheet in terms of how i use this metric personally basically if it's one of these businesses that produces a lot of profit on a relatively small asset base and it's really not the asset size that dictates their profitability that's the type of business where i will just completely ignore the price to book ratio but if it's a business where the assets are sort of the main driver of how profitable that company becomes over time uh then that is a situation where i will be far more interested in the price to book ratio and really what i'm looking for is if it's in and around one or especially if it's below one uh that is a situation again where it's not necessarily guaranteed to be undervalued but it's a situation where i'm able to say that this business could potentially be undervalued it's possibly trading below intrinsic value and it certainly warrants more digging from me as an investor now the third and final metric that we're going to talk about in this video is ev to ebit which is sometimes referred to as the acquirers multiple because of this book the acquires multiple where they talk about eve but and basically uh really interestingly if you had simply just bought the lowest ev ebit stocks in the stock market consistently over a long period of time you actually would have produced a 17.5 percent compounded return from 1973 through to 2017 compared to about 10.2 percent on the S&P500 and that was basically the topic of this book by tobias carlile the acquirers multiple""]"

act as an intermediary between all the independent blockchains created with the cosmos network called zones in cosmos each zone is able to carry out its own essential functions this includes authenticating accounts and transactions creating and distributing new tokens and executing changes on its own blockchain the cosmos hub is tasked with facilitating interoperability between all the zones within the network by keeping track of their states since the hub plays a role in everything that happens on the network it's protected by a decentralized group of validators this enhances security and makes it possible for the entire network to withstand severe attacks these validators take a certain amount of atom tokens with them to pass through the hub and if any of the zones start acting suspiciously in an attempt to maybe compromise the integrity of the network the number of atom tokens that they get to keep gets reduced by the hub i saw a comparison online in which someone said that the hub removing tokens is like the equivalent of getting demerit points on a driver's license eventually you'll lose the privilege of driving this deters malicious actors the primary token of the cosmos hub is the atom which i just talked about but the hub will support many tokens in the future the real value of these hubs zones and the inner blockchain communication packets is that all parties involved in the exchange of value can get what they want all while maintaining independent token models economics and governance systems it's as if each of these parties is its own blockchain within the cosmos network acting as the internet of blockchains i previously mentioned the atom token"", ""And subscribe let's get into it right now we'll start our exploration of Cosmos ecosystem by first taking a look at the tokens in the ecosystem as tracked by coin gecko as we can see the list is quite long and some of these are protocol assets where others are network assets and in some cases they essentially serve the function of both as is the case with osmosis which we'll take a look at here in just a little bit so what we have with Cosmos is essentially an internet of blockchains a group of separate chains that all maintain their own security but connect to the same ecosystem and Network even Terra is an example of one of those chains a chain that's connected to the cosmos ecosystem but hosts its own set of dapps and also operates in many ways independently of the rest of the network stargaze on the other hand adapt we're going to take a look at in a little bit is not only a network connected to Cosmos ecosystem but also the name of the primary dap on that Network our main focus is going to be on the top chains that provide the utility that we're looking for for

environments exist as layer 2 protocols on top of interoperable Cosmos chains in the case of Chronos we have the evm layer by this name and then the IBC layer or the native chain which hosts the evm being crypto.org chain as seen here in the documentation next let's take a look at the data provided for Cosmos Hub by defy Lama"", ""but I like this one better so we'll go with this one again

Advanced steps before we do a little bit on my journey in exploring Cosmos and when I started to study it for the first time back when I started working with Ivan in 2020 one of the first ecosystems that he asked me to look into was Cosmos ecosystem he wanted to know what we were going to be seeing come from the ecosystem in years to come how was this new technology going to disrupt the current blockchain ecosystem and where was it going to iterate on previous Concepts where we had not yet made Headway well in the field of interoperability Cosmos has made more strides than probably any other network it's my own opinion that these technological advancements exceed anything that we're seeing in any competing realm including cbdc's moving on to our more advanced steps we're going to look next at lending if you remember those assets that we held in our wallet after diversifying our atom assets you'll know maybe what we're going to do next here starting first at the osmosis resident

altcoin as far as gaming and coming out of the next run I think that was there really does have a lot of potential to um you know to have explosive growth on the other side so build those watch lists and I promise you when the time comes you will be ready to attack these markets and come out on the other side as a winner from the upcoming recession in which I do think we see"", ""so nothing's really changed on my stance i'm still sitting on my hands i'm ready to deploy and i'm ready to deploy when great projects like vulcan forged are getting backing in their series a from ftx and skybridge in a major metaverse move so as we're seeing here vulcan forge a leading blockchain gaming studio and incubator today has secured its series a with ftx and skybridge and this is absolutely massive obviously uh anthony scaramucci and sky bridge i believe they have 2.5 billion in management as we see scaramucci tweet we are thrilled to be joining vulcan forge community and backing jamie thompson who is behind vulcan forge jamie thompson is awesome we've had him on the show here and interviewed him from vulcan forge i love everything that they're doing and obviously if you watch the show they've been one of my highest conviction projects for a long time and one of the most exciting metaverse and gaming platforms and i definitely agree right vulcan forge is building a lot of quality projects and they just keep on going i mean i believe right now it's 10 plus projects coming to the staple and now that sky bridge is getting involved you know there's just so much more bandwidth even for vulcan forge to work with and they already have a war chest to work with anyway as they are producing quality left and right as we see their very own press release here as we'll take a look at it as skybridge led the round for 8 million for an eight million dollar round which includes the option to invest an additional 33 million to accelerate the growth of vulcan forged patent and metaverse as a service engine metascapes and enables the company to scale operations in north america so what they're going to do vulcan forge is looking to headquarter over in north america obviously i there they are some i believe in their in europe somewhere if i'm correct uh"", ""so I I really think it's really sharpened up everyone's Minds to like okay uh you know you really have to dive into these and really find out who's behind these projects and who's pushing these products and who's actually going to adopt and use and actually what is this applicable for tokenomics ETC and that's what we're here to break down for you every single day because you know if you have all these tools in your belt that we're giving you on this channel then you're going to be able to actually take advantage of this bear market like I said and then Vulcan forged looking forward to a firm part of you know what we're looking at as far as probably my top tier gaming probably my top tier gaming accumulation out of this bear Market everything they've done with Anthony scaramucci skybridge Capital the Elysium blockchain the Met escapes platform it's just absolutely phenomenal This was meant to be on polygon uh on talking about polygon about how the number of nft wallets is really approaching it is approaching the ethereum chain as far as the number one spot on in terms of nft Wallets on different chains so that's good to see as well but when you look at Vulcan Forge the med escapes platform is looking brilliant now this is their metaverse as a service platform this is their meta versus a service platform we're looking at what Jamie Thompson and Anthony scaramucci have said in a recent interview is that you know Jamie's for the CEO of Vulcan Forge said that they've actually built some of the biggest metaverses for other products in other games and other tokens""]"

secrets it's just honestly very simple stuff like this that can put you ahead of other traders and investors so again look for the simple indicators now not everything is gonna be a wedge and you got to be honest with yourself because some people try to misinterpret wedges to meet their personal bias this is a clear-cut wedge you have again the descending resistance and you have the ascending support so if you can find those signs if the price action is legitimately showing signs of coiling in waiting for a breakout or sell-off you know match it with the catalyst see if there's any news headlines that are going well with it if they have any big updates coming you know those things can be the thing to either push it upward downward depending on whether or not it's positive or not and that's where you guys sometimes do your research as well outside of just doing trading all right"", ""and then it went absolute breakout mode and in total this one up more than acts of it's like kind of general price range when it launched from its ICO so again you see a lot of these these players that just absolutely 10x because these very simple signs and price action again you can't really do much technical analysis here outside of that we all we have is price action we can't use any moving averages there's usually no wedges you know it's all dependent on really very simple price levels for resistance and support and again sometimes it is as simple as guaranteeing that that price action is there to confirm that price strength confirmation and in this case it was here and it kept on going up and up and up and finding good support levels at big even numbers so again look towards the ones in the history and you'll learn a lot about how breakout candidates can be spotted early on all right so next up is avert call now we've been talking about her acquittal on the channel but today I want to talk about what really gave us a sign that this was about to break out well the one that really stood out to me was the fact that it was wedging in price action again it's a very simple technical pattern it's nothing complex it's simply a coiling of the price action in regards to whatever cryptocurrency you're looking at in this case we could see an obvious wedge of the price action the support level is rising the resistance level is descending and as we can see the price action gets more coiled in now if you're kind of wondering how a wedge operates and we've talked about wedges on the channel before however on a very philosophical level wedges are a a shrinking of price action of the range of price action where the volatility is going inward and because of this it's setting up Friday breakout to the upside or to the downside it's really waiting for a catalyst to push it up to the high end or to the down end and when we are watching this outside guys you know vert coin in the past has had extreme run ups not only over here but in its previous past"", ""and of course yes you're taking a little bit of risk here but honestly if it's holding the indicators and you have your stop-loss set again there is so many great opportunities to see something go exponential if you can see at holding you know the 21 day that's a serious sign of optimism of absolute exuberance my favorite key term exuberance but again really just look for those simple signs so again I want to run through them real quick what tends to be resistance in the past tends to become new support as so long as the price action can hold it same with the music go here and then also look for wedges look for coiling and price action again it's not always a bullish indicator descending wedges are usually a bullish indicator more likely than not and ascending wedges are embarrassed indicator but if you just get a straight wedge like this it can be a 50/50 game usually in the sense of cryptocurrency seeing as these markets are usually optimistic it's usually gonna go to the upside and along with that if you have positive news coming up or a big event coming that you think is going to be positive of course it's all up to interpretation but having that alongside your indicator can really help you and it was Stratos again the 21 day moving average I can't emphasize that enough if something is holding the 21 day it is an absolute sign of exuberant thanks super ism exuberant nature and price action and again if you can see these indicators coming in together if you can see these three working together that is a telltale sign that something is much more likely to be optimistic and of course there's all kinds of other indicators for breakouts but these are very simple yet powerful indicators you can use inside your trading and investing to spot the next big breakout in crypto currencies anyways everyone that's it for the video thank you all so much for watching appreciate you all checking out the channel and watching the trading tip series if you all

were holding during these time periods on a regular swing trade then the price action is prone to moving rapidly either for or against you not all companies are so greatly affected by earnings but if you're trading one that is you could easily figure that out by looking at the your charter the 180-day Chardon seen how it usually reacts to earnings and if you're trading hashtag winners you need to figure out how to take advantage of rapid increases and how to avoid rapid B creases so to deal with this issue I recommend using what I call monkey support lines now while individual monkey and analyst predictions don't mean much in terms of actual valuation they do mean a lot to sheep investors and we could take advantage of this but the important thing and I do want to warn you is that you don't just blindly trust monkey opinions regardless of where they're at we're not using them as an investment indicator but rather as a fundamental cue as well as a sort of fundamental support line before I get into this though I just want to make sure that you understand what I'm talking about so that you don't get tricked into the monkeys and end up falling face-first into monkeyville if you understand this I highly recommend and encourage you to comment below Charlie I promise you I will never trust the monkeys so with that being said we use monkey analyst support lines to set a fundamental support line that is the average analyst aka monkey target price for the stock that you are looking to swing trade so say we're looking to take a swing position on the 20 day chart for Netflix we see that pre earnings Netflix hit support at 342 had a previous pattern of recovering from oversold and becoming overbought again and again like we saw here so say we want to take advantage of this discount the key would not just to be to buy here because while we do have technical analysis in our favor a poor earnings report could easily take our position and we don't want to mess with that so while we can easily identify the technical level of support we also need to figure out where the monkey level of support is first we need to ferm positive expectations so to do this you can easily go to Google News and find analyst opinions by simply typing in the ticker don't trust any one source no matter how reputable it looks rather open up a bunch of them and see what the average target price is and what they say is the target price over a bunch of different analysts like 30 analysts firms or whatever they'll usually tell you what the average target price is and how many firms are used to calculate that but this step is literally just taking a consensus so this article here a few days before earnings release forecasts general growth from a company with a massive amount of subscriber additions and the company moving into new markets so this is something that I like to see to know that the analysts are generally bullish on the stock and its revenue and its growth as a company and if you're looking through Netflix before earnings on the 16th you see that most of the articles are giving similar opinions and with price hikes from Netflix is monthly membership price increase we are seeing analysts setting the average target price at around four hundred four hundred two dollars do you go on the Nasdaq website you can see the consensus for the target range of Netflix and stock as well I don't know how accurate this is"", ""and it's a better opportunity because we can get in at a better deal because if it gets beat down based on the fact that it's getting delayed hey the anticipatory runs going to be that much more powerful but what are the monkey saying well the monkeys are ranking it at an average price target at 2 dollars and 25 cents with most projecting approval and it doesn't really matter if it gets approved or not this month obviously from a humanitarian standpoint we want drugs that work to get approved but from a trading standpoint it's all about making money and this is a stock that has a lot of upside potential if it does end up getting approved so we're going to need to be watching for those fluctuations and those pre anticipatory runs ok next CH MA now CH ma will be having their FDA approval decision further drug probably messed up the name but acromegaly is apparently a growth hormone disorder for those of you who are wondering but after selling off with the overall market in March its ran up pretty consistently and broke into new highs this is a stock that moved with the overall market during the beginning of the crisis and then wildly outperformed the market in the weeks and months after that is great because we like proof and not promises we want to show proof of price strength but at the same time if we run up too much prior to the date we risk losing or upside"", ""but it's great for taking a general consensus but they are reporting it at 4:17 probably higher than the 402 numbers specifically because it may have been updated after the earnings report but in any case this is another resource that you can use but since we're analyzing this stock in sort of a pre earnings way so we could see in hindsight how we could have taken advantage of the earnings report before it came out we're going to act as if this earnings report never happened and with that in mind we're going to set the monkey support level to 402 back to the chart to plot this now you may quickly notice that the monkey line of support is so high that it's not even on the chart that is fine the higher the monkeys are projecting the stock to go the more sheep investors that are going to help us earn a profit buying into stocks that have massive expectations is better than buying into stocks that everyone thinks are going to crash because as we know in the short run the market is dictated by the opinions of the masses and not the actual underlying value of course in the long run stocks tend to converge to their real value but in the short run and we have fluctuations where people are like I don't know what value this is the real reason the monkey line of support is so important is because it is usually at a price point that is extensively generous since monkeys will be monkeys of course and the reason this is good is because if we know that the monkey level of support line is trading below us that means that our position is a lot more risky if the price action is she trading above it say if the monkey line support was at 300 instead of 400 then we need to be more worried about a negative earnings report or negative news catalysts since the analysts and chief investors are expecting a sell-off and this sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy but the point that I want to get across is that the Maki line support is not so much something that you should use as a actual support line as we think of technical support resistance but rather as a bearing to see where the average monkey is predicting the future price point to be at if you were swing trading you ideally want the monkey level of support to be higher than any technical resistance level now with that being said and just to be completely clear do not take monkey level of support as any indication of what is going to happen to the share price use it only to profit off the fluctuations caused by sheep investors as well as understanding the general consensus when it comes to earnings and overall reports so that you could protect yourself when you're holding swing positions when it comes to earnings and bad news the monkeys may be monkeys but odds are strong that they will have a better idea overall as a general consensus of many monkey firms as compared to you that only has Google and some guy that you watch on YouTube that spends all this time calling analysts monkeys that being said Moe keys are generally over emotional with their target prices or biased on the sector that their firm tends to focus on so you are going to want to find them the average of all of them together like I showed earlier to get a better feel of the monkey support line and overall monkey expectations""]"

free trading with certain balances or other qualifiers so definitely investigate that by checking out our brokerages section to fool calm and the way to get there is from the varied from the front page of fool comm check out to find a broker link under the how to invest tab and that will guide you through to help you show to help you find the different different types of brokerages that are out there so let me give you an example my accounts are actually with Scott trading scottrade charges a seven dollar transaction fee whenever i buy or sell a stock so for me to keep within that two percent threshold I want to make sure that I invest at least three hundred and fifty dollars at one time two percent of $350 seven dollars and so that keeps me within that threshold now if you have an account where the Commission is zero"", ""so it's easier than ever to start investing but there's a couple of things you should consider before choosing your brokerage account to name a few what fees or commission do they charge do they offer automated investments do they offer fractional shares or do you have to buy a whole stock how is their application and website usability this account will be your gateway to investing it's important to research which brokerage account matches your investment style whatever you invest in we advocate for a long-term focus it is possible to make money in the short term on the stock market if you're very lucky however at the motley fool we believe in a diverse portfolio and long-term growth to see the best overall returns okay let's go shopping the stock market the place where you can buy and sell stocks the stock market is open monday to friday 9 30 am to 4 p.m eastern standard time i want to break down the types of investments into two categories active and passive active investing requires a hands-on approach typically by a portfolio manager or yourself passive investing involves buying into a curated grouping of companies or securities let's start with active an individual stock a stock represents a piece of ownership in a company or a share by owning stock in a company you are a part owner of that business you have stake in the business's success now and in the company's future for as long as you continue to own your shares mutual funds a mutual fund is a professionally managed investment fund that pools money together for many investors to purchase securities because these often involve a manager actively making investments on your behalf you'll want to watch out for steep fees now passive the prime example of a passive approach is to buy an index that follows something like the S&P500 index fund an index fund tracks an index or a defined collection of stocks these could be well-known groupings of stocks like the S&P500 500 of the largest companies in the stock market or simpler groupings of stocks with a certain sector like tech stocks or health care stocks this is a super easy way to diversify you aren't putting all your money on one company that way it's a less risky option if one company doesn't perform well etf most often exchange traded funds operate as index funds easily tracking large groups of stocks the special distinction as an etf simply means you can trade these in the stock market the same way you would in individual stock reits or a real estate investment trust is a company that owns and in most cases operates income producing real estate reits own many types of commercial real estate ranging from office and apartment buildings to warehouses hospitals shopping centers hotels and commercial forests you did it made it to the end hopefully you learned a lot from this video and feel more comfortable taking the first steps to invest into the stock market often a lot of people make investing into the stock market more difficult than it needs to be at the motley fool our purpose is to make the world smarter happier and richer"", ""but it's definitely a piece of the puzzle worth taking into consideration step 3 consider the services and conveniences offered pricing isn't everything especially for new investors of course all things being equal it's best to find the lowest price but here are a few other things you need to consider when picking a broker access to research many brokers provide their own stock ratings as well as access to third-party research from firms such as Standard & Poor's and Morningstar foreign trading some brokers offer the ability to convert money in your account into foreign currencies in order to trade on international stock exchanges if this is important to you make sure the broker you choose allows this trading platforms the various brokerages offer a wide variety of trading software and mobile apps and many actually allow people to test out their platforms before opening account for example fidelity offers a demo version of its active trader pro platform for prospective clients to test drive also read some reviews of brokers mobile apps if being able to access your account on-the-go is important to you convenience some brokers have large networks of local branch offices you can visit for face-to-face investment guidance while others do not for example Merrill edge customers can get one-on-one advice and guidance at more than 2,000 Bank of America locations also brokerage is operated by banks offer customers the ability to connect their brokerage and checking accounts transferring money between the accounts in real time and may offer some sort of relationship discount for doing so for this reason it's also a good idea to check if your bank has an online brokerage even if it's not mentioned here this isn't an exhaustive list so before you choose a broker be sure to spend some time on a website exploring what it offers step 4 decide on a brokerage firm you've gathered your information about various firm costs fees and the conveniences they offer for each brokerage you should weigh the pros and cons as they pertain to your investment objectives and determine the best overall option for you for some expert recommendations check out our list of the best online stock brokers at fool.com backslash

high estimate of 235.85 five cents and a low estimate of a hundred and one dollars now I'm a long-term investor all day under a hundred and thirty dollars for Baidu I've made money on the recent move

in Baidu let's do Baba Alibaba AKA my cash cow what is next for Alibaba now Baba had a run-up before Baidu and has been cooling off over the last 11 days now I called Baba perfectly to the penny

made some big bucks alongside of me writing it up recently to a high of a hundred and twenty dollars now I've spent so much time trading Baba that I literally have its candles visually burned into my brain I can see it with my eyes shut my most recent prediction was that we would test 120."", ""mr bbig now mr bbig has been a stock that has provided insane trading opportunities quite a few times over the last year plus but overall it's been a tough horsey in the sense that its overall downward direction has been extremely aggressive and it's been very bar codey and mr barcode mcbarcodey as of the last several trading periods which is generally a disqualifier because it means the liquidity is on the lower side there's not many orders executing unless you get sort of a bar code looking chart which is a problem for dear reasons number one you could get stuck in a position that you can't sell out of and number two it could be more susceptible to manipulation however oftentimes in super small caps they tend to barcode for long stretches of time and then all of a sudden something significant happens and volume and liquidity go up dramatically and for the last 30 days we've been in a situation where bbig is attempting to regain relevancy starting with that mid-august pump it's had a few other attempts at up trending but i believe a bigger more successful attempt is coming in the next few weeks and there's a chance it rivals the mid-august one why you look at the weekly option setup for this week there's a pretty significant concentration in options with strike prices at 150 and two dollars this is a stock that is currently trading at a penny under a dollar right a penny or two under a dollar to have such significant open interest at those strike prices is quite significant because these expire at the end of the coming week and require a more than 50 and 100 run respectively in order to be in the money why would people bet on the stock jumping that much in a week"", ""and it was hard to buy that day because if you remember the markets seemed Unstoppable the Bulls were breaking down trampling the Bears that was the day when Tesla was breaking above the 208 and so it wasn't easy to go against the direction or the flow of the market and just start buying a hedge that would only go up if the markets went down but I knew that on that very bullish day if I was going to take that trade that was the day to do it now this morning I took profits at 39 thousands of dollars of profit made on the sqq today now I gave that 39 Target in a previous video so you guys knew where I was eyeing if you've been understanding my game plan you understand that even though these markets have been in a micro bullish Trend I expected them to back test four thousand and if the trend is going to continue to the upside we should see a pop from that 4000 level and that's the perfect spot to take profits on the bearish sq's Hedge now I know that from the chat there are a few of you guys out there that played the cues without a stop loss and you got stuck holding at a higher level the big question that you're going to have for me is will the sqs get back to 41 or even as high as 51 and I'm going to cover that next before I do please welcome me back from my trip to Peru by hitting that like say hi and throw a heart in the comments I have to say I'm truly happy to be back I appreciate all the support and the kind comments that I received while I was on my trip it was a very successful trip but it's really good to be home back in the States guys stop trading alone subscribe to get daily stock and crypto videos tonight I'm going to be doing a live on Larry's page with Keenan Grayson stockmo don't miss that I think it's going to be absolute fire now I want this video to be super clear all this talk of us being in a micro bullish Trend could be confusing now I will not believe that the markets are in a macro bullish Trend until we break above and close above that previous high that was established in the mid-august of 2022 of 43.25 until that happens all the bullishness that we have seen in the last three months is just a long bear Market rally a lot of stocks have moved back to the top of their trade range and if we break back below that 39.50 which we're very close to today and we don't make a new high or low these markets could easily give back the 20 pump up from the October low and if you got back into big Tech or Communication Service sectors the ones that have been pumping where stocks are up a hundred percent or more from their lows Tesla for example up 100 meta up over 120 percent if you got back into these and you don't intend to play with a stop loss your Investments could be positioned right now for a 50 loss in the next 45 days if we break that 39.50 if we break that higher low position then statistically the likeliness of us getting a lower low has become very high now this doesn't mean that every stock is going to get back to its June or its October lows if you didn't buy your favorite stocks at those key moments you may never see those prices again that is why I repeatedly said that you have to be prepared to buy on days that nobody wants to buy now I've provided both sides of the bullish and the bearish case for the market but I'm going to recap the economy is still smoking hot""]"

just in case one of those or two of them were to happen at the same time in this case save enough on the side to make sure that if you lose your job you'll be okay for the next three to six months make sure you have the proper home insurance to make sure you're covered in the event of a disaster go and get regular checkups so that if something were to happen at least to catch it early and spend

exactly how to get there but when it comes to someone's life or finances most people just wing it and hope that eventually they end up where they want to be unfortunately though life never really works that way and unless you have a plan you're probably not going to achieve it this means figuring out what you want to be doing how much money you'll realistically need to save and where your priorities are I think most people would be shocked to learn that they don't need the tens of millions of dollars to live the life they think they want and they haven't come to terms with the fact that they don't want to run a multi-billion dollar Global Empire just carefully think about exactly what you want to do throughout the day and how much that's realistically going to cost then work backwards to figure out exactly how you can achieve that for example a waterfront home in Florida could be a million dollars Home Furnishings could be another fifty thousand dollars a used Ferrari could be a hundred and fifty thousand dollars and six thousand dollars a year in maintenance going out to restaurants is another two thousand dollars a month maybe spend two thousand dollars a month on hobbies and another two thousand dollars a month on miscellaneous stuff all in you would be able to buy that lifestyle for 1.2 million dollars in one time costs and one million nine hundred and fifty thousand dollars invested though even though that might seem like a lot of money you could get there by investing twenty four thousand dollars a year at an eight percent return over the next 30 Years essentially that's just you maxing out your 401K throughout your entire career and voila you got that retirement now for the rest of your life so if you haven't already done the math add it up

And those local weather patterns and different elements. This is gonna have low liquidity, but low volatility because it's not a major exchange. It's a physical farm, an actual piece of real estate. Higher level of complexity and much higher costs. Crowdfunded sort of gives you the best of both worlds. You have better return potential than REITs. There is lower liquidity. So, you do have to be in it for the long haul. This is not the type of investment where you put your money in for six months and take it out. In most cases, it's gonna be probably a five plus year time horizon, but you're gonna have that low volatility, because you're not correlated to the stock market, a little bit more complexity, but a lower cost, more complexity than the REIT, but obviously, less than a direct investment in farmland. However, if you do decide to use one of these crowdfunded platforms in particular AcreTrader, they have a whole team that manages all of this for you."", ""Number two, direct purchase of farmland or a particular farm, that would be if you went out yourself in your local area or somewhere in the country and found a farm, got a mortgage, bought it yourself, and then rented it out most likely to a farmer or decided to be an owner operator, and farm that land yourself. Number three is the one that is growing in interest much quicker, and that is investing in farmland via crowdfunding. That is where people from all over the place kick in a investment towards a particular farm. They all invest together and there is a separate entity managing the farm related duties. Now, we're gonna cover the basics here in this video guys, but if you looking to learn more about farmland investing, I actually have a completely separate blog that I started exclusively about investing in farmland about a year ago. It has free guides for beginners. We have reviews of pretty much every single farmland investment platform available today. Right now on the blog, we also have comparisons as well as podcast interviews with many of the top farmland investment platforms."", ""So if any of that interests you guys, make sure you jump over to farmlandriches.com and bookmark that website for your future reading pleasure. There's also going to be a link down in the description below. So let's start off with some statistics about farmland in the United States. Well, first of all, there are 911 million acres of farmland in the US, and over half of the acres are rented rather than owned. So, a lot of people are actually buying farmland as an investment, and then renting it out to a farmer as a means of income or potentially preservation of wealth as well. 45% of US farmland is in small family farms, and 80% of rented farmland is owned by non-operators. Now, here in the United States, the top three crops grown are number one, corn, number two, soybean, and number three, wheat. So if you have ever driven all over the US, which I actually did a couple of weeks ago, it was amazing to see all of these massive corn fields and soybean farms all over the country.""]"

consider this if you invest 10 percent of your income starting at the age of 20 years old it'll take you about 51 years of doing that to accumulate enough money for your investments to replace your income if you bump that up to 30 percent it'll take you 28 years and if you manage to save 50 of your income you could literally retire in 17 years while your investments earn enough to sustain your lifestyle indefinitely that's why getting in the habit of saving as much money as possible as soon as possible is going to help you build your wealth as fast as possible even if you're not making a lot of money up front just start because it's going to be a lot easier to maintain once you do actually start making more money then once you've done all of that here's the secret sauce number four create multiple sources of income now this one is so important that the irs actually published their research on high income tax returns to study the distribution of economic well-being or in other words they wanted to know why some people made more money than others and what they found is that generally the more income streams you have the more income you tend to make so when you see that 65 of millionaires have three or more sources of income i would take that into consideration and do your best to diversify as much as you can now if you're curious which income streams are the most common for millionaires mentioned in the study the main income source was derived from a job or earned income from a paycheck this is where almost everybody starts off and it's the equivalent of you working a normal 9 to 5 job or being paid a salary or working on commission is the main source of income for most people this is the cash cow that makes everything else possible and funds the remaining income sources like number two dividend income this is probably the easiest second income source that pretty much everyone watching could start literally right now"", ""this is a retirement account that you could invest pre-tax money into and then you're taxed later on the money after the age of 59 and a half and third you could look into investing within an HSA which stands for a health savings account essentially this is used for medical expenses and both contributions profits and withdrawals are completely tax-free now there are some qualifications for this and a quick Google search will tell you whether or not you're eligible but if you are you could invest another three thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars a year this means just between those three options you could potentially invest and shelter up to thirty two thousand eight hundred and fifty dollars a year in income without doing anything fancy number six not having more than one source of income this one is actually so important that the IRS issued a report on high income tax returns and what they call the distribution of economic well-being which basically means they want to figure out why certain people make so much money and what they found is that the more income sources you have the more money you tend to make in fact when it comes to this 65 percent of millionaires have at least three sources of income so you are doing yourself a disservice if you're not actively working on something on the site to bring in some more money this is also going to dramatically help you build more wealth since an extra income Source should in essence be extra which would allow you to save the difference and invest now as far as how you could do this besides working a part-time job on evenings and weekends you could consider starting a business now sure a lot of new businesses do end up failing but with the internet there's never been a More Level Playing Field when it comes to Building Wealth you can now run a

reduces the need or desire for some types of spending such as trips and Vacations so at least the bright side is that you'd be able to save a little bit more if you haven't done that already and finally third now is the time that you could begin withdrawing from your retirement accounts without incurring a penalty remember all the profits you made in a Roth IRA are completely tax and penalty free after the age of 59 and a half so enjoy you can also begin collecting from Social Security in your late 60s along with cashing out of a 401k so go ahead and buy that Lamborghini you've always wanted just kidding anyway all of this is meant to get you to real realize that at the end of the day even though net worth is something to consider a much more reliable indicator of financial Independence is simply how much money you spend relative to how much you make just remember that it's completely possible for somebody to be worth 20 million dollars and be completely broke because they constantly spend more money than they make just like it's possible for somebody to be worth five hundred thousand dollars and be financially free because they only spend twenty thousand dollars a year that's why I think what really matters the most is just how much money do you spend it's all about realizing this as soon as possible and then working within your means to optimize your spending

twenty six percent return is very unrealistic is very very unrealistic guys so this one we're going to go ahead and do the same numbers a hundred dollars originally and then you add ten thousand dollars per year you still grow for 40 years but you get only an 8% return 8% return is how much the stock market goes up on average per year over like the past 50 years or whatever you would be at about 2.8 million dollars guys about 2.8 million dollars you would have in your account and that's only growing at 8% so you're only basically just have your money in a market account or a money market account or something like that guy I mean you're only adding 10,000 per year in your original principal was only a hundred bucks and you have lost 2.8 million dollars at a time I hope you're you're kind of seeing some of the power of this compounding now let's say you're doing really well for yourself you got a successful small to mid-size business and you're able to put a hundred thousand dollars away per year and you get you're doing that for 40 years you're growing it out don't only 8% which is just the market return you're going to have almost twenty eight million dollars in your accounts at a time and that's what's only starting with $100 originally so in $100,000 if you're going to put that much away you're probably going to need to be making around four hundred to five hundred thousand dollars per year which is going to be very hard to do if you're young if you're in your 20s or 30s unless you start a business because most people work in at corporations at our executive level but making that kind of money there's 50 60 year old so it's going to be unrealistic and literally unless you started your own business and make it a success now I found something fun here guys so Steph Curry the NBA player he's supposed to get a two hundred and seven million dollar contract this summer five years two hundred seventy seven seven million dollars"", ""and you're only 15 years old or whether you're watching this and you're 40 years old uh you know the longer you wait if you wait till you're 20 or i'll tell you 45 if you wait an additional five more years um you're gonna have five less years of compounding on your side and compounding is really the powerful force that can help grow investments up into much more than the initial amount that you put into them so i'm going to put up a couple of example charts here firstly let's say you're 25 years old and you've got 40 years to invest before you hit the magical 65 years of age and you go into retirement now if you invest ten thousand dollars uh when you're 25 and invest it for 40 years uh if you make around an eight percent return that's been sort of a typical long term average in the stock market uh that will grow your ten thousand dollars into about two hundred and forty thousand dollars over that period of time a substantial gain uh now let's take the example of someone who waits until they're 35 to get started investing uh they put that same ten thousand dollars to work you will see they only end up with about a hundred and ten thousand dollars uh when they're 65 so the earlier you can get started and the earlier you can get compounding working on your side uh the better you're going to be and the other advantage of starting early is that you can get all the dumb mistakes out of the way with small amounts of money if you start when you're 17 or 18 or 25 years old somewhere in that ballpark you're probably not going to have a lot of money to invest you're probably not going to be working with six or seven figures or anything like that um if you're investing a couple thousand dollars and you make some dumb errors and and lose some money it's not going to be something that sets you back dramatically for the rest of your life um if you do however wait till you're 40 and you've got a couple hundred thousand dollars saved up and then need to figure out what to do with it um"", ""but then you just put in an extra hundred dollars we're not talking about a lot we just put an extra one hundred dollars per year per year you just put in an extra hundred dollars guys that's hardly anything L most it doesn't matter what kind of job you have or what situation you and you can probably save a hundred dollars in a year you had 40 years to grow just like all Emily you have the same 26 percent return now you have over 6 million dollars by just adding an extra hundred dollars per year for you guys that who want to add it up 40 years times 100 dollars that's only four thousand dollars cash there's only four thousand dollars added over time but look at how much it changed the results this is my playing what the compound calculator is so powerful because it will open up your mind how compounding really worked in the possibilities of compounding now let's amp this up a bit let's say you have that original hundred dollars right in the say you add a thousand dollars per year you had a thousand dollars per year which is still doable for most people for most people a thousand dollars a year is doable that's less than a hundred dollars saved per month so this is a very realistic amount now at the same time you're still getting that ridiculous return of twenty six percent per year but you would have a worth 51 million dollars now at this point 51 million dollars so I'm not satisfied though let's say we do $100 originally still""]"

that's a minimum so most likely everything is gonna be at least as much or more and now let's figure out the last and most important piece which is how did we get this tight range and here's how we did it we have a filter called minimum and maximum range in the last 30 minutes and what I selected was 25 cents so that means while it had made a move of at least a dollar 85 at some point today between the high and the low in the last 30 minutes it's only been in a 25 cent range and this is how you design this particular filter there's no other filters set up so when I go to my strategies tab you see that there's a heartbeat alert what happens is this if I don't select any other alerts the heartbeat will automatically default to let me know that these are the stocks that meet my criteria again the heartbeat is an automatic default to let me know that these stocks meet my criteria so let's take a look at what this looks like here we go right now IP HS has come across and again today is June 18th and you can take a look at this on any chart and confirm it for yourself we're doing this lesson in West Coast time here's the tight range over the last half hour"", ""and we decide you know are we going with an alert alert window or a top list window um we'll do for this exercise we'll start with an alert window and everybody's alert window is going to default to be something i forget exactly what it says i think it's going to be like breaking out on volume will be the windows name for everybody when they start and you can change what your default blank alert window starts with your new default alert window start with this just happens to be what i did mine as i tried to keep it very simple what's in what's in here for me starting off and just a few filters that i'm you know big into using alert windows have two components to them so let's start with that first alerts are going to be events so these here new high new low new ask high new new low bid you know items like these the single icon those are going to be your events or also were better known as alerts then you also have your filters your filters will look like this there'll be a dual set of icons here this teal color will indicate a minimum value that you'll add for that filter and this purple color will indicate a maximum value that you can add for that filter as well"", ""welcome to the video tour for trade ideas pro trade ideas software is a new breed of electronic trade idea generation technology designed to help traders find better opportunities in real time it combines the latest developments and user interface design real-time data mining and filtering that brings an unparalleled view of what is happening in the market right now let's take a look a trade ideas alert window consists of several columns these columns provide detail information regarding a particular situation in the market that is taking place right now traders use a configuration menu to select specific events that they want to see let's take a look at some of those options trade ideas has alerts for different styles of trading activity and for different types of traders options range in complexity from simple events such as highs and lows to complex situations and pattern recognition to alerts aimed more at the institutional trader such as the V WAP and blocked trade analysis alerts the second tab titled window specific filters allows a user to filter the universe of stocks that is currently being tracked since trade ideas looks at all stocks in real time all the time if a user does not apply any filters it is easy to get inundated with information trade ideas does not require the user to know anything about programming or technical analysis it has a library of pre-configured strategies that can be used right out-of-the-box let's take a look at the high-low ticker high-low tickers are available in some applications but none give you the multi timeframe option which allows you to see the long term and the midterm trends for stocks making highs and lows additionally this is a good example of how fast information can come through trade ideas if not filtered there's no need to worry about system overloads or tying up resources because the processing takes place server-side at trade ideas data centers now that we can see how fast data can come through let's unleash the full power of the system through its filters as I mentioned earlier filters located on the second tab from the left are a way to limit the amount of stocks that trade ideas monitors just like the alerts filters range from the very basic such as minimum price maximum price and average volume you know right now these filters are blank because by default we are monitoring every new high and low let's put some values in there to make things a bit more specific now the system is only looking at stocks between 10 and 100 dollars and that have a maximum spread of 10 cents at the time of the new high and low and trades an average of 1 million shares per day now let's press ok and notice how the flow of data slows down to meet the filtered criteria as we look further we notice that filters allow you to paint almost any type of graphical picture in your mind to look for very specific positive or negative situations the more you learn about filters the more power you will get out of this software additionally you can filter for stocks traded on certain exchanges and you can create symbol lists to monitor only a specific group of stocks that you want to monitor finally after setting your alerts and filters you can name the window something that makes sense in terms of what alerts and filters were created for example we will name this window trade ideas video tour for brokers press okay to start the new window you can create multiple windows to watch different strategies and place them side-by-side now we are going to set up to alert windows above a level 2 window with

134,133,23,133_resistance_support resistance_support_level,"['resistance', 'support resistance', 'support', 'level', 'line', 'structure', 'trend', 'price', 'lines', 'uptrend']","[""if in a downtrend that very most recent structure support level that was broken it's going to be a very accurate place to predict that the market is going to continue in trend to the downside so that very simple concept applied out here on the daily chart is what is made for some really accurate predictions for us here at the trading channel week after week now whenever you add this most previous level of structure that we just broke which would be right here our resistance level whenever you add that concept to a structured level that has been tested multiple times as you can see this level was used as resistance twice here and as support by our big green candle right here when you combine those two factors that's what has come together to create one of the most accurate ways I've ever found to predict price action moves and when using these two concepts together you're not only predicting price action moves you're also predicting them in in trend continuation as you can see this market was breaking structure levels into new highs and the only way for this concept to work is if the markets breaking structure levels in the new highs or breaking structure levels in the new lows and a downtrend in order for you to wait for that pullback in to that previous level that maybe combines with another previous level of support looking left and give you a possible accurate trading opportunity based around your trading plan so take this concept go out in the market test it for yourself see how many times it works vs. doesn't work apply different things to this you can apply indicators to this to help make it more accurate there's nothing wrong with that and you can apply anything else that already exists in your trading plan to this as well and guys I know this concept sounds simple and for a lot of new traders for some reason they believe that trading has to be extremely complicated but in reality the more simple your rules are for trading the easier it will be for you to follow them and more complicated doesn't always mean more accurate this is extremely simple and I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of the best ways I've found to accurately predict market moves this extremely simple concept of understanding trend and structure levels and guys if you'd like more advanced training on structure levels trend along with the entry reasons and the entire trading plan that we use here at the trading channel then you can learn more about that in the EAP training program which there's a link for in the description but otherwise let's continue the video so now that we've talked about what we're using let's go ahead and apply this to some other markets here we have the dollar"", ""support and resistance support and resistance are probably the two most important words in technical trading support is a level or area with the surplus of buyers that acts like a floor of causing price to bounce off it and reverse resistance is an area or level with the surplus of sellers that acts like a ceiling that causes price to bounce off of it and reverse support resistance levels are based on historical pricing one price stops and reverses it forms a support resistance point there is an increased chance that if price hits the area again it will stop and reverse again furthermore if prices has stopped and reversed in the same spot more than once already if the price hits that area again the chance of it reversing again is even greater sometimes red lines have life support as well what this happens price bounces off of the tread line often price will channel would tweet to support resistant slides with two trend lines what causes support and resistance why this price sometimes seem to magically reverse at the same price over and over again there are lots of different thoughts and theories on the subject however what it comes down to is that support and resistance happens because behind the millions of trades each day are millions of traders markets are not made up of price charts that move up and down at random markets are made up of people people that think and feel and have emotions furthermore markets are not just made up of people but of crowds crowds at very primitive they lose the ability to think individually research for a leader they act irrationally they follow the same patterns and they repeat themselves in short support and resistance happens because markets follow patterns because markets are made up of crowds and crowds follow patterns drawing support and resistance lines is not complicated usually this is achieved by simply connecting two or more spots that price reversed on on either a horizontal or a slanted line there is no one correct way to draw support and resistance lines and when the lines are actually placed as a matter of personal preference some traders will connect the extreme highs or lows like right here others will you just use the bodies of the candles and ignore the wicks and still others although not as common will simply draw the line right through the thickest cluster hoping to get as many people as possible included each trader must find what works best for them support resistors works in both directions when price breaks through support it becomes resistance what price breaks through resistance it becomes support one price is inside the walls on the channel the walls help keep price inside the channel one price breaks through the walls of the channel the walls help keep price out of the channel there are other forms of support and resistance as well whole numbers moving averages pivot points Fibonacci numbers and more typically the more tides price respects to support a resistance level the stronger that level is however the hits a threshold at a certain point where price is respected the area so many times that the area begins to become weaker and the chance of breaking through begins to increase with each new approach as price approaches support a resistance traders will use volume and momentum to gauge whether the field price will break through support or resistance or bounce off in reverse since volume is not available in spot forex traders will sometimes use the volume from currency futures as a substitute as price approaches support a resistance is price gaining steam with the volume increasing or as price losing momentum and volume decreasing the support and resistance lines on a longer time frame chart will be stronger than the support resistance lives on a shorter timeframe chart for instance the support resistance lines on a weekly chart will be stronger than the support resistance lines on a daily chart and the support resistance lives on a daily chart will be stronger then the support resist on an hourly chart the support level on a 15-minute chart probably isn't going to cause the price to change on a daily chart however price on a 15-minute chart may bounce off of a daily support level over time older support resistance lines tend to fade in strength as older traders wash out leave the markets in newer traders enter the markets that were not in the market the last time the support and resistance level was respected so that concludes a basic overview of support and resistance this is the end of the first video on the subject in the next video we'll cover the support resistance price cycle see you then"", ""so when we price dips below the view app line that line switches to resistance and the lower 25 percent threshold serves as support now this is where it gets interesting so going back to one of the most helpful uses of these lines that they give you an early indication or a warning sign of a more sustained upward momentum if you see an increase above the 75% tile line that's an early warning sign of this uptrend and if you drop below the bottom line that's a bigger sign of a downtrend this makes a lot more sense when you think about the rules of support and resistance when something breaks above resistance that's a sign we'll see higher highs and when something breaks below support that's a sign that we'll see lower lows while this is true by definition you must use your understanding of the RSI the MACD and most importantly the SMA to most accurately predict how far up or how far down these are going to go afterwards so at this point you should have a good general idea of what the V whap is and how it is used so let's go over another example to really beat this in so let's look at Tesla now if we are looking at Tesla and today we can spot many points where the V whap would have been useful first off the stock price pretty much held support and traded below the view app and held about at resistance thing here as we did see several breaks above the V whop line but they fail to support so that wasn't a strong indication of a continued uptrend now when we saw this more consistent gap up later which by the way had consistently growing real estate between itself and the SMA line which which is why it's so important to combine your usage of other indicators but we then saw a breaking above the V whop line which means that this V whop line was no longer resistance but now serves as a support line as a reminder when shares are trading under the line it serves as resistance and wind shears break above the line that serves as support anyways now as we know from the price action earlier a break above the V whop line means that we are experiencing higher highs but it doesn't mean that the stock will continue up trending but again an early sign of a continued uptrend was this consistent gap above the SMA line and most importantly it is consistent over all dipping back and forth from support then later we saw a gap in the SMA line and a continued uptrend I just want to reiterate that these indicators are never an end-all be-all of the stock market it's really about developing a skill set and working knowledge around using all these indicators in conjunction with solid strategies and more consistent practice honestly it's all about practice and learning the EFT you have to or ball this stuff like a sponge and the best way to do this is by watching these videos by watching other trailer videos a lot of traders don't recommend you to watch other training videos but there's just there's such there's such a plethora a plethora of knowledge on the internet that you could absorb and it's super important for your training to just take in all the dog you can as well as all of the practice but anyways if you have any questions for me or comments or whatever comment below we also have the zip trader circle Facebook group which I plugged a bit in the beginning but it's really a great place to learn and it's really a

to click on it click right now the school makes students poor PhD expense report helpless and desperate the riskiest thing you can do is go to school learn from a fake future put your money with

series but thankfully it doesn't take long to figure out that within the seven minutes of the video the real takeaway I got from it that you need to do right now otherwise you'll be poor is to buy his book fake money fake teachers fake assets because the entire video never really specified any actionable advice beyond what you could get from a brand-new entrepreneur Instagram page who post hustle memes all day not to mention that there were some very imaginative assumptions made in the video like this one some of the biggest fake douches all those financial planners but telling to him you know to save money why would you save my time the government's printing money not to mention this one and you look at all the pensions of the schoolteachers firefighters all guys with 401ks they're all bankrupt because Wall Street stole their money from them I think that he thinks we're living in a parallel dystopian universe where everything is reversed because history has shown that a twenty year holding period in the stock market has never once produced a negative result so alluding to putting money in the stock market over 40 years could lead to bankruptcy is quite didn't jump to make doesn't really make sense to me"", ""so here's the deal it was recently found that real wages have barely budged in decades more than half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and the poorest 70 of U.S households don't even have a savings account however there is some good news because the survey reported that Americans would need 500 000 to feel financially secure and a million dollars to retire so in this video we're going to be talking about how to do exactly that starting from nothing in 10 years I know that sounds extremely far-fetched but it's entirely possible and these are my own recommendations from personal experience that I've learned firsthand because there are some step-by-step rules that anyone can follow that work incredibly well that don't cost you a single penny if you have the goal of calling yourself a millionaire exactly 10 years from today although really quick if you enjoy topics like this it would help me out tremendously if you hit the like button or subscribe if you haven't done that already doing that gives me a really good indication of whether or not I should make more videos like this in the future so let me know thank you so much for watching and now let's begin to start before we go into the steps that you could take I'm first going to tell you how I was able to build a million dollar net worth by the age of 26 years old without coming from a wealthy family without any inheritance and without posting a single YouTube video on how to get rich because despite me now making a lot of money talking on YouTube about how to make a lot of money that's not how it initially started but first for Ryan to making money came when I was about 16 years old working a part-time job throughout high school at the time I was paid one dollar for every picture I took in Photoshop that a marine aquarium wholesaler so instead of being paid for my time I was paid on results on a really good day if I was focused I'd be able to make anywhere from 80 to 120 dollars for about five to eight hours worth of work and I loved it now I don't usually recommend that other teenagers follow this advice but I would usually skip school work weekends and take every holiday as an opportunity to earn even more and by the time I was 18 years old I had about five thousand dollars saved up now from there I decided not to pursue college and instead use some of those savings to get licensed as a real estate agent so I could do that full-time even though I didn't know know anyone in the industry and I hadn't the slightest clue what I was doing I would spend every weekend going to open houses and asking other agents how they were able to grow their business by pure luck I met an agent who allowed me to work underneath them help them out with whatever he needed and whatever business I brought in would be split 50 50."", ""and if you clicked on this video looking for investing advice for teenagers you're probably gen z or maybe you're just the parent who's looking for advice for their kids or maybe you've stumbled on the dark corners of the interwebs at 3am but whichever one it is you've come to the right place and speaking of all the different types of generations i just read somewhere that zoomers are destroying millennials on tick tock and that just isn't fair cause millennials inherited the worst economy known to man we have the lowest job prospects the least amount of money out of all the generations boomers think that we're entitled and now zoomers are beating up on us i can't start this video on adulting until i've had my morning coffee and you smash the like button because you owe it to me don't be such a hufflepuff i cannot do this video with a straight face this is ridiculous being a millennial is the thing i hate and love about myself the most and this wasn't even bought for this video i literally had this in my kitchen pantry this is embarrassing everyone knows that us millennials were a mistake so leave britney alone put jokes aside let's talk about the best investing advice for teenagers and this really applies to everybody the earlier on in life you hear this the better off you'll be i just wish this was stuff that i heard it when i was in my teens because i would have ended up with a lot more money than playing cards in my bank account but lucky me i watch the secret and the power of the secret compels me to make money out of all these playing cards clearly real bills because uh money's stiff like that let's begin [Music] hi my name is andre and i like to think of life kind of like a

It's still a little bit opaque when you buy. Even on ClickIPO, you don't buy shares, you actually put in a dollar amount and they try to allocate accordingly. There are restrictions and eligibility requirements. Once a stock goes public, there are a lot of things that affect that stock price over the course of a year, including lockup periods from insiders. So, it's a little bit tricky. For a beginner investor like Brett, I personally wouldn’t recommend something along those lines. You can invest in so many great, innovative companies that are already in the public markets. Gardner: That's right, Andy. I think about, here in 2018, remember this IPO? Spotify. It's a big, well known company. A lot of people excited about it. It came public. The stock did pretty well initially. It rose, even though this company's still not making money. But it's a global brand, and a big-time business. But these days, months and months later, it's right  back to about the price were it IPO-ed. It sold off. And that often happens with these IPOs."", ""Cross: That's exactly right. Over the years, we've invested in many, many, many IPOs that have gone on to produce great returns for public market investors. Gardner: And some bad ones, too! Cross: Oh, I certainly have too, David!   Gardner: Too early and hard on Great Wolf Resorts. I remember that one. But, keep going, Andy! Cross: The market is now so much better for finding information. I talked to Aaron Bush, analyst with us here at The Motley Fool, a fantastic analyst and researcher. He pointed me to a few resources that I want to share with Brett. The first one is clickipo.com. Mobile-first, friendly application that helps regular individual investors not just learn about IPOs and businesses that are setting up for an initial public offering, but actually invest in them because their online app ties directly into many brokerage accounts. It's really fascinating. In that application, you can sign up for it free, you can find out about companies that are preparing in the registration process to go public, and you can track the information that Brett may be looking for. Full disclosure, I have not used it."", ""Is there a resource, Andy Cross, that you use or that we use that you'd recommend to listeners, a helpful way to track private companies? Cross: Brett, first of all, congratulations! Not only do you have a cool last name, but congratulations on getting started with investing with the Rule Breaker style. That's fantastic,  especially with someone who's in your age bracket. You have many, many years of investing ahead of you. Long-term, patient, business-focused, innovative investing is the way to go. I just wanted to say that. Congratulations on that, Brett! Second of all, the IPO market has shifted and improved so dramatically over the 20 years -- 22 years now last week -- that I've been investing alongside you here at The Motley Fool. And there's a lot more information. Historically, it used to be very difficult for individual investors to invest in IPOs. When we say IPOs, by the way, initial public offering, for those who are not used to that acronym. It's for private companies that are issuing stock into the public market. Gardner: When a new common stock is born, something you and I can buy on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ.""]"

followers I'm want to do asking for their allocation to US versus non-us it turns out about 84% people allocate more to the US than to a base of passive in index that's a pretty big active bet on valuations not mean reverting are you really willing to make that bet we like to call that a home country bias if you're a new listener in the podcast you may not have heard me talk much about this if you're an old-time listener you're probably tired of listening to me talk about this that's where people put way too much into their own country stock market happens in every single country around the world has this same home country bias Vanguard talks a lot about it every investor thinks their own country is special and allocates more than the passive index suggests happens in the US happens in the UK happens in Japan happens a lot in America happens everywhere so in a world where everyone thinks they're special it's hard to be objective about something you are emotionally connected to which is why it's so important to be asset class and location agnostic as you look around the world with an ID of valuation you better ask yourself is the u.s. really that special or are you just licking

front of the pastries so with all due respect to the mom my money is on her perhaps being just a little bit biased and the investing world mini US investors commentators financial media think that the u.s. is gifted by this I mean they to believe that our stock market is the healthiest and most robust therefore it warrants a higher valuation than that of other stock markets around the globe is that true are we special or does US market lick the display glass just like everyone else I'll post this chart to the show notes but as you can see is that right as I discussed this the US trades at a long-term cape ratio of around 30 that level is fairly high from a historical perspective for further context to keep average from countries around the globe is around 16 right now that makes us level almost double the average country is that normal many pundits will list the myriad reasons why the US deserves this lofty valuation the rule of law gap earnings stable government haha but take a quick look at history will cast doubt on the explanations first if the US is truly special it should always be special right meaning if the US market is so fantastic that a higher valuation has always warranted than historically it should always have a higher valuation but that's not what history tells us if you look at a chart showing the US Cape versus the rest of the world X u.s. this is just foreign stocks going back to 1980 which is we don't have a whole lot of great valuation data before that both have an average Cape ratio of about 22 let me repeat that the historical valuation premium has been zero beyond that the amount of time each spends being more expensive than the other is basically a coin flip sometimes US stocks are more expensive sometime foreign stocks are more expensive that stat surprises a lot of people who assume that the u.s. being currently expensive always trades at a premium and for some reason deserves to after all the US is special if you look at this chart will post to the show notes you can see that foreign stocks were more expensive during most of the 80s and there's a reason for that whereas the US has been more expensive during the internet bubble and again post financial crisis the reason that foreign stocks traded so much more expensive in the 80s had a lot to do with Japan hit the biggest bubble we've ever seen again not some backwater economy still one of the largest economies in the world stock market in the world in the 80s hit a caper ratio of almost a hundred in the 80s and dragged foreign stocks to be quite a bit more expensive than the US which was cheap during most the 80s how many of y'all were buying stocks hand over foot when stocks were trading in the early eighties and single-digit kabe ratios generational buying opportunity today however marks one of the widest valuation spreads in history with foreign markets trading in a much cheaper levels than that of the u.s. there was one other time when we had a massive valuation spread but it was the opposite foreign stocks were much more expensive in the 80s but in this case the u.s. is the spread only intensifies if we zero in on the cheapest quartile of

present you some extra techniques and indicators to help you capture the trend over a set period two basic indicators you might hear often are support and resistance the support line is used to point out the bottom of a downtrend in which the plunge is expected to bounce back and push the price back up on the other hand the resistance line refers to a level on the top where an uptrend may defer technically the support line indicates the lowest price so traders can buy the dip and resistance is the highest price in a bull market for doing that after that an inverted trend will take place making the market balanced again next we will have moving averages while the simple moving averages are pretty appropriate for showing the trending lines by connecting different averages in market price i'll give you an advanced variant of that which is called moving averages convergence divergence the macd main line is generated from the subtraction of two of the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages or emas plus there is a signal line from a 9 day ema each macd creates a historiogram based on the difference between the two emas i have to admit it sounds quite complex but hang on you just need to understand that a positive macd line above the zero lines refers to an uptrend otherwise it's in a downside and when the macd line is above the signal line it often indicates the entry point the opposite situation might suggest the time to exit guys are you still with me where did everybody go the lecture is not over"", ""ok so let's go ahead and label everything so to start you already know that the purple line indicates the view app line and it's the most important part of the indicator because it tells you whether or not a stock is trading below or above average for your selected time period the top line is the 75th percentile of the average in the lower line is the 25th percentile of the average now if you think about this in terms of an analogy on height for example if you're on the 75th percentile of average you're likely to be considered pretty tall and if you're under the 25 percentile you're likely to be considered pretty short likewise if a share price is trading above its 75th percentile that is statistically significant and is one early sign of a more sustained upward trend and if it's trading below its 25th percentile a sign of a more downward trend but of course these indicators don't predict price action but are rather statistical tools to predict the probability of where the price action is going to go now to understand why the view app and this information is important to you on a practical basis let's go over how it's used and what it's known for so the view app is famous for being used by institutional investors and big mutual funds as well as these computer algorithmic trading platforms when your uncle Billy tells you that the stock market is rigged by those at the top this is who he is referring to now the reason these big corporations like the view app is because these players by extremely large amounts of shares and must if they aren't careful they could move the share price over all think about it if you're buying 200 million dollars of shares in a billion-dollar market capitalization company this is obviously going to have a huge effect on the share price that's also why individual traders such as you and I stay away from super low volume stocks on an individual scale because it's going to be very difficult to get into and out of positions at the price points that we want if it's such a low volume stock but anyways in summary the view app helps protect institutional investors and automatic algorithms from this problem by indicating a good position to get in based on the statistical formula employed by the view app so to add the view app all you need to do"", 'hello and welcome this is an overview of the standard deviation the standard deviation is a measurement of the rate of dispersion or volatility around an average or expected value of a set of random data the standard deviation shows how tightly clustered around or how spread out a set of data is from the mean or average of that data in other words if one takes an average of a set of random data such as the periodic daily returns of an asset the standard deviation shows how spread out or scattered the data is from that mean the standard deviation is sometimes referred to as the measurement of the scatter and although not completely accurate the standard deviation is also sometimes referred to as the average distance away from the average the symbol for the standard deviation is the Greek letter Sigma which is a circle with a little line extending to the right the standard deviation creates a range around the mean such that a certain percentage of the data falls within the range and a certain percentage lies outside of the range on a set of random data a range of one standard deviation around the mean contains about 68% of the data in other words about 68% or about two thirds of the data will be within one standard deviation of the mean furthermore if we double the standard deviation then the range around the average is two standard deviations above and to below this range will contain about 95% of the data in other words about 95% of the data will be within two standard deviations of the mean if we increase the range to three standard deviations above and three below about 99% of the data will fall within that range in other words about 99% of the data will be within three standard deviations of the mean this is known as the empirical rule we can use multiples and frac of the standard deviation to figure out a range for any percent of the data we can then use this to calculate out the probability or odds of the future event occurring which we will cover more in later videos in finance historical volatility is the standard deviation of the periodic returns in most cases the historical volatility of an asset is the standard deviation of the periodic daily returns over one year this is the rate of change that the stock went up and down each day not the dollar amount that the stock changed in price which is a common error often made so in short the historical volatility of an asset is the standard deviation of the periodic daily returns over 1-year period when the data is more spread out for instance when a stock price has large gains and losses each day it means that the stock has more volatility in other words it means it has a larger standard deviation when the data fluctuates up and down less it means the stock has lower volatility or a smaller standard deviation standard deviation is used in probability calculations the average of the data and the standard deviation of the data are the two inputs used to create a normal distribution curve standard deviation is also used to measure risk in return such as mean variance optimization which is used in Modern Portfolio theory to determine asset allocation based on risk and return standard deviation also has many other uses that go beyond the scope of this video it is a useful tool in many aspects that are well worth studying so that is an introduction to the standard deviation in the next video we will cover the math involved in calculating out the standard deviation however I will mention ahead of time that the standard deviation function is built right into Excel and Google Docs so while it is good to understand the math behind the calculations one never has to actually do the calculations by hand see you in the next video']"

their phone right like it doesn't have to be professional photographers lots of people sell presets geared towards hobbyists and instagramers who want to edit their photos on their phone now to sell your presets you can use a marketplace like filter grade that will help streamline the process of marketing and selling the product these services usually take a percentage of your sales so if you're looking to actually keep all of your profit you should instead sell them on your own website or e-commerce shop overall a super cool way to make money with an evergreen digital product so that brings us to the next digital product which is selling social media templates this includes things like instagram story templates content creating media kits or really any template that will help anyone on social media for example you could sell templates for real estate agents that need better advertising for their properties on social media the reason why people buy these social media templates is for two reasons one they don't want to take the time to learn how to use photoshop which is what most people assume is needed even with free and easy to use platforms like canva people don't have the time to spend creating and designing their own posts which is where you come in especially with the growing number of professionals joining social media platforms the demand for these types of templates will continue to go up and up and as you guys know i love selling things that are trending upwards in demand like all other digital products you need to invest time to create the templates upfront"", ""but after that they can sell over and over with zero product costs to you and you're really saving people a ton of time by supplying them with these types of templates which means you can charge a good amount for them the process is very simple if you use a platform like canva to create all of your templates because you have tons of click and drag elements so you don't need to be a design expert at all there's also programs like photoshop and illustrator that take a long time to master but if you want the easiest program to use i just recommend going with canva focus on making targeted templates for specific people so for example you can make instagram story templates for specific niches like real estate agents loan originators and other entrepreneurs these types of people are the ones joining social media professionally for the first time and they're absolutely going to be looking for these types of templates it makes sense because if they buy a template all they have to do is plug in their own text and pictures to have a social media post in under a minute next up is fonts and i think that this is one that you guys use a lot but don't realize you can actually sell your own font as a product preferences and fonts are constantly changing so if you're someone that can create fonts you're in luck more than 600 000 companies are being made every year and with everyone moving to an online business model there will be a huge demand for new fonts if you guys are into graphic design then this could be a really great way for you to experiment with your artistic creativity while also making a good amount of passive income per month the average price for a font is about 30 let's say you do a hundred sales per month that's going to equate to three thousand dollars which is amazing if you don't care about keeping 100 of sales but want more exposure you can also sell it through an online font reseller like creative market where you keep between 10 to 70 i know selling fonts sounds a little bit out there but you can really make a living off of it depending on how much effort you put in for example jeremy vesey makes six figures per year selling fonts on creative market it's definitely a strenuous process to create a font and it's definitely a skill you need to perfect but like every other product on this list it's a crate once get continuous sales 24 7 type of deal and your buyers can come from anywhere in the world making the market absolutely massive for our next digital product we have spreadsheets these include documents calculator spreadsheets and any template that helps do conversions or calculations billions of people use spreadsheets every day and because of this you can actually make a ton of money selling them some popular templates that have been created are ones to help people with bookkeeping dieting expenses data sets and more the problem is that many of the applications out there like microsoft excel or google sheets can get very advanced which is why you see tons of influencers on tick tock and youtube starting accounts dedicated to teaching others how to use it if you're curious about whether there really is an interest in this market take a look at miss excel or your excel friend on tiktok their videos generate tens and even sometimes hundreds of thousands of views for their excel tutorials which i'll admit are extremely helpful i can also see these types of tutorials being helpful if you're a college student taking an excel class as well as anyone that's just you know looking to make your life easier if you guys are already in a certain niche i guarantee you that you can create spreadsheets to help people if you're in real estate you can create spreadsheets that calculate returns on investments for properties if you're into credit card points you can sell spreadsheets that help calculate point values or compare redemptions between different airline points"", ""so yeah by no means are they high ticket digital products which is good because it makes it way easier to sell similar to the notion templates you'll find that it becomes lucrative once you start selling packages bundles and add-ons that give people even more value which of course will allow you to charge an even higher price another cool thing about creating pdfs is that you don't actually have to make money off of it right away you can instead offer it for free as a lead magnet when people sign up on your website so that you can grow your email marketing list and make a profit later down the line with other digital products if you want to get started with selling pdfs the easiest ways to design them are through websites like canva google slides and also using programs like keynote once you've finished designing you can export it into a pdf and upload it onto your website your course or a platform like thinkific gumroad or etsy overall it's a really solid way to get into the digital space with very little overhead plus pdfs on average are way easier to make than many of the other digital products we're talking about in this video next is digital art which encompasses any artwork that you sell digitally online you can create logos for youtube channels or brands you can create and sell downloadable patterns or wallpaper that people can purchase and the reason why these are so much better than selling physical art is that you're once again leveraging the power of the internet meaning your art can be shown to pretty much the entire world now there's so many different ways that you can sell your artwork but the one i'm going to focus on in this video is just selling digital arts on a platform like etsy when putting your digital art up for sale there are two main ways that you can list it either as an instant download or made to order an instant download would be an image that immediately becomes available after they purchase it and a made to order is when you have custom digital art that will take time to customize and make before sending it to the purchaser now definitely prefer instant downloads because you have the ability to make fully passive income that has zero product cost but of course if you want to charge more per order you can definitely go down the custom print rep there's so many people out there selling their digital arts and""]"

bank']","[""Biden signed an executive order which called for the highest urgency on cbdc research and development and since then both the federal government and the Federal Reserve have done quite a lot at advancing this goal and the next step towards moving to a system like this is going to be starting in about 53 days it's going to be launching right at the beginning of July which is why controversy is skyrocketed and you're seeing this covered everywhere Florida's governor Ron DeSantis called this an attempt for government surveillance and control a few days ago he signed the first in the nation legislation to protect against government surveillance of personal finances the bill prohibits the use of Central Bank digital currency in the State of Florida Texas as well just rolled out a similar bill and it's expected that more and more states are going to hop on this trend of banning Central Bank digital currencies however proponents of cbdc's have said that these are an essential step to protect the American Consumer and save the planet the Biden Administration for example has said that a central bank digital currency could and should protect consumers investors and the environment former FTX CEO and reverse philanthropist Sam bankman freed called Biden's approach constructive a lot of people are saying if he thinks it's constructive it must be a good idea right it must be very very good the IMF ran an opinion piece same at cbdc's can use less energy than existing payment systems and thus fight climate change and a lot of people are arguing out there today that hey if we could save just one polar bear over the next 500 years maybe it makes sense just to let the government control every transaction that we do because if they can allocate it well they can allocate it in a way that saves at least one polar bear obviously as humans were pretty selfish because we want to have like a good quality of life now but if we could just simply let the government control everything well maybe we wouldn't have such a good quality of life but maybe one or two more polar bears would be alive in 500 years but the fascinating thing about the cbdc program here in the United States and really everywhere abroad where they're trying this they're trying it in China they're trying it in Europe there's talks to try it in places like Australia but the fascinating thing about this Central Bank digital currency government currency digital version of whatever native currency whatever you want to call it is that it gives a lot of benefits to the government in terms of control in terms of actually being able to revoke currency if they think certain groups of people shouldn't have it in terms of limiting certain economic activity that they don't want to see like buying too much gas for example which could be a pollutant or for example just being able to see what you buy and sell gives the government a lot of control and surveillance capabilities but doesn't really give much in terms of benefits to the everyday citizen now obviously over the last few decades more and more people have felt that the government should have a bigger role in our lives and should control more things but this is one of those areas that you want to be really really careful because this might be a pretty core Freedom that you're going to lose Heartland reports perhaps most disturbing of all however is that under most of the cbdc designs discussed by the Biden Administration and Federal Reserve nearly all forms of ownership of cbdc money would also be strictly limited only large institutions such as Banks the federal government and or the Federal Reserve would actually have ownership of cbdc's everyone else would be prevented from having absolute control over their digital money now right now if somebody wants to go and give you a hundred dollars maybe you'll put it in a bank account and then the bank has those hundred dollars but you still technically have the hundred dollars yourself you're an ownership of them the hundred dollars can be inflated to the ground don't get me wrong"", ""and in the public sector AKA central banks they acknowledge that the stable coins being built by crypto are not always that stable and that the cbdc is being developed by central banks can increase the risk of Bank runs they note that the study will focus on the possibility that both types of digital currencies will integrate fully with the financial system for the purposes of the study the authors assume that these digital currencies will compete with bank deposits and if you watched our recent video about the banking crisis you'll know that Banks make money by investing deposits in other assets and they can be temporarily insolvent when the value of these assets go down naturally the authors are concerned that the ability for depositors to quickly withdraw their money as a cbdc or stablecoin could lead to financial instability as banks are forced to sell assets at a loss to honor withdrawals newsflash this is basically the cause of the current banking crisis in the United States what's interesting is that the authors predict that this outflow of deposits could be beneficial to asset prices this makes sense given that many of the outflows from banks that we've seen so far have been invested into U.S government debt AKA U.S bonds and some have been invested into alternative assets like gold and crypto what's fascinating is that the authors also predict that the benefits of digital currencies to households could outweigh the financial stability risks obviously they imply that this only applies when the digital currency in question was issued by the government and specified that stable coins should be restricted the authors then give an overview of existing literature about the subject they revealed that all existing research about digital currencies focuses on how they could impact the financial system during good times and bad times they believe that this study is the first to examine the effects of a full integration now when it comes to their mathematical model I must admit that most of it flew over my head but there are a few parts that stood out to me for starters the model assumes that cbdcs and cryptocurrencies are equivalent not surprisingly the model focuses on stable coins that are backed by U.S bonds for those who don't know most of the stable coins in circulation are backed by U.S bonds this means that when you buy a stablecoin you're effectively subsidizing the US government spending meanwhile the stablecoin issuers make mad money from the interest rates on their reserves this is why it's surprising that the model does not assume that stablecoins will earn interest but does assume that cbdcs will earn interest the model also assumes that each cbdc transaction will not be automatically taxed which is something that governments have discussed extensively in their research the model even makes some assumptions about how households invest their money but that maths is way above my pay grade I must admit following many more complex mathematical models and even more complex calibration the authors finally break down the results they analyzed what would happen if the supply of digital currency in the economy increased from 18 to 26 percent for regular reasons no crisis no Black Swan Etc the authors found that this small increase in digital currency Supply would make the financial system less stable and therefore increase the probability of a financial crisis it would also cause the value of Bank stocks to fall which makes sense given that Banks make money from investing customer deposits the authors also found that this small increase in digital currency Supply would provide a slight benefit to households this is due to the aforementioned increase in asset prices that would result from such digital currency issuance and also lower levels of asset price volatility due to all the extra liquidity the authors then showcase the risks to the financial system and benefits to households using two graphs as you can see keeping the supply of digital currency close to 18 would minimize risks and maximize benefits this ties into the next section about the optimal level of digital currency Supply as hinted by the graphs the less digital currency there is in circulation the lower the risks are to financial stability conversely the higher the digital currency there is in circulation"", ""the more benefits there are to households what's annoying is that the authors don't say what the ideal percentage is they explain that this is because it's not up to them to balance the risks and benefits of digital currencies that's presumably up to politicians however they do make an epic assertion cbdcs are a bigger threat to financial stability than stable coins this is the opposite of what you tend to hear these days they explain that this is because cbdc's are more analogous to bank deposits than stable coins this makes sense when you remember that the model assumed that cbdcs would earn interest whereas stable coins would not holding a cbdc would be the logical choice if that ends up being the case the thing is that existing literature about cbdc's well at least not the Central Bank reports we've summarized does not assume that they will earn interest in fact this literature suggests that cbdcs will actively lose value due to the taxes included in every transaction you'll recall the authors referred to this what's crazy is that even though cbdcs don't earn interest are taxed on every transaction and are unlikely to be adopted research still suggests that they will pose a threat to financial stability this is because Central Bankers seem to be under the impression that everyone will see cbdc's as the safest asset ever what's funny is that projections by the bank for international settlements or bis the literal bank for central banks suggests that only between 4 and 12 percent of people will voluntarily adopt cbdcs you'll know this if you watched our first video about cbdc's that will be down in the description it's a really good watch even if I do say so myself anyways the Assumption by the authors that cbdcs will pose significant financial stability risks seems to be a way to justify limiting the supply of stable coins this is because they State quote optimal regulation would limit the supply of digital currencies when the only risk is coming from cbdc's now this relates to the conclusion of the study wherein the authors spell it out plain and simple if digital currency truly becomes a part of the economy it will benefit households by a whopping three percent and double the risk to the financial system by an equally whopping six percent up from the three percent Baseline rookie numbers Jokes Aside the authors also highlight the scapegoat they created in the discussion quote digital currency whether privately or publicly issued is likely to be detrimental to financial stability and bank valuations can be significantly harmed despite these harms coming from cbdc's as per their own admission so this brings me to the big question and that's what this study means for cryptocurrency in contrast to the stated conclusion the study suggests that stable coins are a preferable alternative to cbdcs that said neither of the two are preferable if you want Financial Freedom in a digital currency system I've said it before and I'll say it again the true definition of Financial Freedom is the ability to transact when you want with whoever you want and for however much you want this kind of Financial Freedom doesn't seem all that important but it will be when stable coins and cbdcs become more common that's because stable coins and cbdcs are both centrally controlled this means that the issuers of these digital currencies will have the final say on all of your transactions be they stable coin issuers or central banks in other words it's ultimately the issuers of these digital currencies that own them not you we've already seen a few stories about stablecoin issuers freezing tokens associated with illicit activity although I haven't seen any stories about central banks doing the same with cbdc's their own documentation states that they will have this ability and will use it whenever they feel it's Justified if you watched our recent video about a speech given by fed Vice chair Michael Barr you'll know that one of the only differences between stablecoins and cbdcs is that stable coins will provide slightly more privacy protection this is because governments will need legal permission to access stablecoin data beside the fact that most governments will spy on stablecoin transactions regardless most stable coins exist on publicly viewable cryptocurrency blockchains this means that anyone will be able to see every transaction and the mandatory kyc at exchanges means it's easier to connect crypto wallets to identities on that note another one of the only differences between stable coins and cbdcs is that a digital ID is required for cbdcs to work this is why governments around the world are so focused on rolling out digital IDs""]"

world first of all quant's founder and CEO Gilbert Verdian has an excellent track record it's actually impressive when you look at all of his former roles in jobs that he had this guy worked at BP for

paid or mandated to do any of our reviews furthermore I'm not your financial adviser and this is not financial advice we're a team of analysts who conduct our research and present our views for educational purposes only also if you're new to this channel then you may want to hit that subscribe button for the latest crypto analysis news and reviews now with that out of the way let's see what particle is all about particle has an ambitious goal of building a decentralized economy supported by all the key elements of blockchain technology privacy interoperability and security there are three key features that are part of the particle ecosystem these are the particle platform the part coin and the open marketplace let's take a closer look into each one of these then shall we the particle platform is where decentralized application DAP developers can build their own privacy centric daps many different kinds of gaps can be developed on particle but the common thread that links them all is their use of the part coin to process transactions the part coin is the utility token which powers the platform it is a privacy coin that can send anonymous transactions as well as be used for voting in the ecosystem it can also be staked for an additional source of income finally the open marketplace is actually the first app that was built on the platform it's a completely decentralized and private marketplace where people can buy and sell anything they like part coins are used as the medium of exchange and these features solve many of the biggest problems with e-commerce platforms today lack of privacy data breach is caused by poor security lack of censorship resistance and high transaction fees if you wanted more information on any of these aspects then you could always read our long form review in the link below something else that I found quite interesting about particle was their proposal mechanism this is basically a way for those in the community to submit that can then be voted on this includes an aspect of decentralized government to the protocol the particle team is quite extensive and they come from many different backgrounds there are software engineers entrepreneurs and a host of well-known strategic advisors and we actually interviewed Paul Schmidt sir of the particle team and you can find that interview again in the link below particle is also quite unique in that they did not hold an IC o---- and did not conduct any pre mines this means that the project is more decentralized and hence fairer currently part is available on 4 different exchanges although the bulk of the trading is taking place on bit tracks with over 80% of the volume this volume is quite thin currently which could impact liquidity for large orders if you want to store particle then you can either use their proprietary wallet or you can store it in a trestle something else that is pretty neat is that you can stake your coins from a hardware wallet this is called cold staking your coins and keeps them safe while still earning that staking return so in conclusion particle is an interesting project that's more decentralized than most their unique approach to privacy centric taps and the open marketplace is quite unique amongst crypto projects they will need to increase the trading volumes across the more exchanges if they're to increase adoption and awareness of the project now what are your thoughts on particle do you have any more questions for me I'd love to know in the comments below now also don't forget to hit that

accumulating tokens and coins as far as the security of the actual tech is concerned i'll break it down it's true that some blockchain networks prioritize speed over security and there are always hackers trying to alter blockchain code to try and make more tokens the good news is that the more prominent blockchain networks have been tested by hackers because they're almost always under attack the more computers a blockchain has validating its transactions the more secure a network is a 51 attack happens when more than 50 percent of the computers in a network are hacked or controlled by a group of miners or validators with bad intentions they can prevent transactions halt payments and reverse transactions allowing coins to be double spent now we've been talking a lot about blocks and chains and other tech stuff so now is a good time to explain just what the heck a blockchain actually is at its core a blockchain is just a fancy spreadsheet in the cryptoverse we call this a ledger the ledgers are cut up into chunks or blocks and these blocks are chained together in one giant file called a blockchain the giant blockchain of spreadsheets gets authenticated and verified so there aren't any double spins or other errors this is called consensus and it's a big part of what makes crypto so special consensus means computers are validating transactions and agreeing that the information is correct the two most common ways of achieving consensus in a blockchain are what's called proof of work and proof of stake bitcoin is a proof of work blockchain where specialized computers compete to solve complex math problems and are rewarded with bitcoin we call this mining the more people competing to solve blocks the more secure the network is new miners are incentivized to join the network as the value of bitcoin increases thereby making a positive feedback loop of network security of stake blockchains like cardano avalanche and polkadot are more scalable because they don't require expensive mining equipment or energy inputs like proof-of-work think of proof-of-stake like depositing coins into the crypto equivalent of a piggy bank users can store their tokens into one big piggy bank with other people and they're called delegators the person who keeps the electronic piggy bank up and running is called a validator the token protocol has rules that randomly select validators to add transactions to the blockchain which earns rewards that are shared by everyone who has stored their tokens in that validator so because major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum have so many computers validating the network or so much hash power it is extremely unlikely that they will suffer an attack they're just too many computers or a bad actor to control networks that suffered 51 percent attacks are mostly dead projects that have fewer nodes to validate transactions we've covered what cryptocurrency is and whether it's a safe place to invest money but what gives cryptocurrency its value well value can either be innate or acquired valuables like artwork gold or any other asset have innate value because they're scarce an acquired value is something like trust in a country's government like for the dollar or the yen but ultimately it doesn't matter why people want something it only matters that enough people want it in the case of crypto limited supply of certain projects coins can make holding the asset more desirable simple supply and demand there's also the key element of what the asset can do that creates value many crypto tokens have utility that gives access to platforms they can give holders the ability to trade and create opportunities for wealth building make decentralized payments and easy peer-to-peer transactions or act as a long-term store value speculators also believe that crypto assets will increase in price over time as their utility becomes more widely used so let's break down some of the different types of cryptos starting with the most valuable bitcoin created in 2009 by anonymous developers satoshi nakamoto bitcoin is the first digital currency designed to be a form of payment that doesn't require a middle man for financial transactions the first bitcoins were mined by home computers but as bitcoin mining became more competitive and mining rewards continued to be halved every four years asic miners became a more profitable way to mine bitcoin there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places smallest unit is called a satoshi after the creator buying small amounts of bitcoin is called stacking sats and can be one of the best ways to dollar cost average into bitcoin ethereum ethereum is a decentralized software platform powered by blockchain has a native cryptocurrency ether or eth that's used to pay for transaction fees making the price rise is ethereum games adoption the ethereum blockchain can be used to create and fund decentralized applications or dapps and other secure digital technology the ethereum blockchain's community ran and home to digital money global payments and applications right now the ethereum blockchain is proof of work and ether is mined the merge to ethereum 2.0 where ethereum will become proof of stake is expected to happen sometime in the summer or fall of 2022 crypto assets other than bitcoin are known as altcoins even ethereum although i would argue that ethan has become enough of a household name that it no longer deserves the label altcoin but all coins capture around 40 of the total crypto market cap as of today there are different types of altcoins with different use cases stable coins are cryptocurrency's bank account assets that are pegged to another asset like the us dollar stable coins are used for storing funds ramping fiat to crypto exchanges and trading crypto assets circles usdc and tethers usdt are examples of secure collateralized stablecoins that are backed by company assets and reserves utility tokens are a way to pay for blockchain functionality this means that ethereum's ether is a utility token along with cardano's ada governance tokens give holders voting rights for example uni is the governance token for the ethereum-based d5 platform uniswap security tokens are digital contracts that represent fractions of a real asset like a company recording ownership or stake meme coins are tokens that get their value from community buys and not fundamentals they're driven by hype and online communities privacy coins or cryptocurrencies that can hide blockchain transactions to create an anonymity""]"

look at how to set up a demo trading platform with think or swim in today's lesson we're going to continue our course on the logistics of stock trading with a look at how to read stock quotes so let's get started for anyone who missed our lesson on setting up a demo account I recommend pausing this video and clicking the link above this video to register for a free think or swim demo so you can follow along as we go through this lesson for everyone else go ahead and click the icon to launch the thinkorswim platform and enter your username and password once you've logged into the platform you should see the trade page of the platform which will be blank one of the reasons why I've chosen to work with the thinkorswim platform is because you can trade pretty much any market that you would like well this is a positive that allows you access to many advanced features as you become a more experienced trader this also means that there are lots of things on the platform that are not relevant to us at this stage of the game with this in mind I recommend simply focusing on learning the areas that we cover in these lessons and leaving the other parts of the platform to be explored at a later time now that we have this out of the way we can go ahead and pull up our first stock quote stocks are represented by something which is known as a ticker symbol which is an abbreviation normally from one to four letters which represents the name of the company that you wish to trade the first thing that we'll need to know in order to pull up a stock quote is what the ticker symbol is for the stock that we wish to view luckily the thinkorswim platform has the ability to look up a stock ticker symbol built right in to get to the ticker symbol lookup feature click the two blue down arrows beside the symbol window which will bring up a drop-down menu with some tabs where you can click the lookup tab for the purposes of this lesson we're going to look at a quote of Microsoft so go ahead and type in Microsoft and as you're doing that you will see it come up in the drop-down menu where you can double-click to populate the quote window once you have the window populated with the Microsoft stock quote represented by the ticker symbol msft what you're going to see going across the screen from left to right is number one the last column this is the price of the last trade in Microsoft stock next in line is the net change column this is the change in price in Microsoft stock from the opening price to the last trade price the bid column this shows the inside bid price which is the best price at which the public can sell the stock the ass column this shows the inside ask price for the stock which is the best price at which the public can buy the stock the size column here you will see the number of shares of stock that are available at both the bid and the ask price in hundreds the number on the Left represents the size available at the board and the number on the right represents the size available at the ask when I say sighs I mean the number of shares available to be traded the volume column volume is the same thing as the number of shares traded in the stock so what displays here are the number of shares traded in the stock for that day in general the higher the volume for a stock the narrower the spread which is the difference between the bid price and the ask price next in line you'll see the open column this shows the opening price for that day's trading and lastly you'll see the high and low columns these columns show the highest and lowest price for the stock in that day's trading these are the main columns that you'll need to understand at a minimum in trading stocks other features which can be seen on this page by clicking the blue arrow to the far left of the quote window and which will cover the significance of in later lessons or the dividend yield the price to earnings ratio the earnings per share the dividend amount the frequency of the dividend the dividend date the 52-week high and low price for the stock the beta put/call ratio and number of shares outstanding level two quotes which basically show the prices in the market in addition to the inside bid and ask we discussed above can also be seen on this page by clicking the blue arrow in the next row down besides where beside where it says trade grid level two quotes are a more advanced feature that will be covering in later lessons if you would like to watch multiple stocks this can be done from the quote page of the platform which you can bring up at the top of the page by clicking the quote tab once you've done this click on the options button which will bring up a drop-down menu where you can select create new watch list once you've done this you can name your watch list click enter and then click under the symbol column to populate the watch list with the quotes that you wish to follow if you don't know the symbol for a stock you can right-click in the symbol column select symbol lookup and type the name and just as you would have from the trade tab another nice feature of the thinkorswim platform is that trades can be initiated

back to the 1800s and look at a 50-year period in 1864 silver was 2.94 cents an ounce by 1870 the price had dropped to a dollar 43 per ounce people that bought silver in 1864 and held it to 1870 lost over 50 percent of their value during that time ten years later in 1880 silver had dropped to a dollar twelve per ounce people that bought silver in 1870 and held it until 1880 lost over 20 percent of

we go back to February last year in our web archives we can see that the hundred ounce bars trading around sixteen dollars an ounce when silver was around fifteen fourteen dollars at the time so again around a dollar or two over spot at the moment it's seven dollars over spot because there's just such a huge demand again Keith talks about this where on their website when silver fell from 18 to 12 they didn't drop their price down from their coins because they thought that's not fair value so all these guys to have their price up where they had it when silver was $18 an ounce so now we get to how we can take advantage of this and we want to use these different products so if we head over to eToro where i trade might you know my ETFs where it's the US markets and we're not things that we otherwise access to in Australia this is currently trading for $30 $30 below the actual silver price the ETF tends to track so we can do at the moment is by the SLV ETF and when it silver goes back to 18 or 21 dollars an ounce where I think it's going to go the price of silver here and the profits you're going to make are going to be up 50% from let's call it $14 to $21 to use round numbers that's a 50% gain so you're gonna be in 50% profit but at that stage once the the price of silver gets back up to 21 these hundred ounce bars you know they're only gonna be a dollar or two over spot so they're going to be trading for hopefully 22 maybe 23 dollars an ounce over spot now these are in aussie dollar prices so you know let's not get confused with all the math there but the point is that it's going to go from this beak gap at the moment which is currently around $7 back to around a dollar or two so while that is happening let's take advantage of that and let's ride the fake paper price up these ETF price up put on our traders hat make that extra money hopefully we've got 50% extra money and then we can choose to head over to our favorite bullion dealer and buy physical silver

But when you think about it this video format can range from absolutely terrible all the way to genuinely value adding and informative. The video’s that people like Graham or Kevin make are normally towards the good end. They will normally react to personal finance by watching video series like millennial money or they talk about high end real estate which is obviously an area of extensive expertise for these guys. There are other’s like Dave Ramsey who will do live reactions to people that call into the show and despite these being a bit repetitive they aren’t really doing any harm (apart from the ego’s of the callers) If you want to argue that these live interviews are not really reaction video’s just think to yourself, “am I watching this to see the solution to the persons problem, oooorrrrr am I watching this to smugly partake in Dave’s reaction to this persons situation?” Even still this is just a bit of light entertainment and who knows, maybe you will pick up a nugget of information along the way.', 'Instead the focus of this video will be on a group of internet guru’s with much more influence, a much larger following, and much more credibility, the personal finance personalities. So it’s time to learn how money works and find out why you probably shouldn’t be learning to work your money like these popular youtubers might suggest. Now I want to preface this by saying that I personally enjoy watching people like Graham Stephan, Andre Jink, and from time to time even dave ramsey (as a guilty pleasure). None of these guys are outright nefarious scammers like the hustle bros you will see pitching an amazon automation course and this automatically makes them a million times better than this other group. What’s more is that they are genuinely entertaining, they give people a sneak peek into their own success while presenting relatively dry content in a way that is funny and easy to understand. The problem is though. Personal Finance should be boring. There is a common saying that everything you need to know about personal finance should be able to fit on a postcard, some authors have actually done it.']"

was reported that in the United States the average single worker paid 30.5 percent of their income to taxes in 2022 meaning that one-third of your entire working year is spent earning enough just to

you as much money as possible from my experience hiring a good accountant goes a long weight saving you a lot more money and by doing this you should be able to save at least another three dollars a

understanding of taxes here in the United States the average single worker pays 30.5 percent of their income to taxes meaning one-third of your entire working year is spent just to earn enough to pay

money most of these unfortunately are never taught in school no one ever tells you to do anything about it and generally people just accept that taxes are as inevitable as death which is true but there are ways to at least make it a little less painful for example if you're working a typical nine to five job see if your employer offers a 401k which can reduce your taxable income by the amount that you invest we're looking to tax less harvesting you're losing Investments the end of of the year so that you could offset up to three thousand dollars from your paycheck or if you're on a business it might make sense to run that through an LLC or an S corporation so that you could reduce your self-employment tax there's so many different strategies out there that you could legally utilize to keep more money in your pocket and a lot of that comes down to your understanding of the tax system or hiring a professional who does number five ignoring retirement accounts I guess since we're on the topic of taxes it makes sense that we talk about this one here because there can be some serious money to be made just like the law allows you to legally reduce your tax bill it also offers you Financial incentives if you invest and three of them are fairly easy for almost anybody to do the first is a Roth IRA that allows you to contribute up to sixty five hundred dollars a year and all the profit you make within that account is completely tax-free at the age of 59 and a half second you can also look into investing within a traditional 401K which allows you to contribute up to twenty two thousand five hundred dollars a year like I mentioned earlier""]"

ways of statistics and yet most people lose and it's because most traders fall into this habit of holding winners uh sorry holding losers too long and selling winners way too quickly they create a negative profit loss ratio for themselves you know their average losers maybe 200 bucks their average winners are a hundred you know it's it's negative profit loss ratio therefore they would need to

now being sent to the market these orders are initiated from alerts generated from the trade ideas alerting application we've modeled six strategies three long and three short which have been extensively back tested in the odds maker an add-on tool to trade ideas pro having the detailed historical success ratios of our strategies gives us the confidence necessary to run the robot unmanned here's a sample of what the oddsmaker output looks like aside from the success ratio of the strategies over the past 15 days it displays the average winning trade amount the average losing trade amount your net winnings had you been trading one share increments the best trade the worst trade and the consistency the results also break down the number of points made or lost including the number of trades generated on each of the 15 days analyzed one minute into the market open our resolve is certainly being tested we're quickly down over seven hundred dollars we're currently in 44 positions 37 long and seven short we're continuing to put on trades for the next 45 seconds so we're not going to concern ourselves with these unrealized losses right now you see our total downside is protected because we automatically place a protective stop on every position that we have at this point we've been stopped out of two positions for a total realized loss of 104 dollars minimizing our downside and diversifying our risk are keys to our long-term success there are 15 seconds to go before we stop any new orders we're down a total of about 600 dollars in both open and closed positions we've been filled on a total of 57 trades utilizing approximately two hundred thousand dollars in buying power using a default of 200 share orders a total of 8101 shares are currently open we do not send our orders out as all or none so we may have partial fills our open positions have stabilized down five hundred dollars off its biggest drawdown of just over nine hundred dollars using the odds maker we've optimized our hold time on these strategies to that of 15 minutes i'm gonna go ahead and stay focused on the p l while i time lapse this video our blotter just turned positive after a small gap down opening we filled the gap and are continuing to move higher we're in far more long positions than short positions with just a couple of minutes until our scheduled exit we're now profitable by eight hundred dollars on our open positions closed positions are down ninety four dollars let's watch the exit we finished the day up 861.46 trading"", ""[Music] what's up everyone ross here from warrior trading so in this episode i'm going to walk you through the simplest day trading strategy for beginner traders now as a beginner trader what's your goal hopefully your goal is to take one or maybe two trades a day where you're minimizing your risk while maximizing your potential for gain that way even if you're only right 50 of the time hopefully you can still walk away with a little bit of profit now we know that trading is risky and we know the statistics that most traders lose money and of course my results are not typical i have to say that but as a beginner trader i think you could do yourself a really big favor by focusing on keeping it simple so the simplest strategy is to focus on the leading percentage gainers each day and this is a big deal so the stock that i traded today and this is a great case study and i'll show you examples of it as we get into the video it went up 200 percent 200 is a huge move now i didn't capture the whole move but i captured small pieces of it and small pieces of 200 percent that's five percent here seven percent there three percent there ten percent there those are big pieces of profit if you're like most beginner traders and you're trading stocks that are in a relatively narrow range getting a small sliver of a five percent move you're not even getting enough profit to justify the risk and so you're going to have most likely an inverted profit loss ratio where your average losers are bigger than your winners your accuracy is going to be poor because those types of stocks are choppy and you're not going to do well so the best thing you can do is start by focusing on the right type of stocks to trade and those are percentage gainers and gappers so this is a gap strategy focusing on the leading gappers and gainers each day and as we get in the video i'm going to show you not just how to find those stocks each day and how to understand whether or not they have the potential to make a big move but also i'm going to talk a little bit about my entries now this is a short video i'm not going to have time to go through the entire strategy and all of its nuances i do that of course for students who are part of our curriculum over at warrior trading but if you're testing the water you want to just learn more about my strategy the way i trade i encourage you to hit the thumbs up and subscribe to the channel every morning i do a live audio video broadcast it's called the morning show and i share with you my watch list for the day and a couple of the stocks that i'm thinking about trading and sometimes i even take some live trades during the morning show it's a great opportunity for you to learn a little bit more about the way i trade and to see whether or not you want to learn from me in our classes so make sure you subscribe the channel hit the notifications button that way you'll get the alert when i go live each morning it's usually between sometime between 8 and 9 a.m that i go live all

being able to earn more money just consider this it was found that employees who switch jobs every two to three years make twice as much as the person who stays within the same company so consider switching careers leveraging your skills or learning something new to earn more money especially now while many businesses are experiencing a shortage of talent and willing to pay anything possible to find the right person although overall I will say that most people that you hear about who are able to make a lot of money relatively quickly do so by starting a business they saw an unfulfilled Niche and created a solution to a problem or they saw an existing business and figured out a way to do it better obviously this is a huge risk and a big time commitment but if you find an industry that scales quickly you can make a huge amount of money and finally before we go into the Practical step-by-step blueprint number three realistically you're also going to have to invest your money the fact is even though I kept my expenses extremely low and scaled my income throughout my early 20s I would not have become a millionaire by 26 if I didn't invest as an example just consider this if you want to save your way to a million dollars in 10 years you're gonna have to put away 273 dollars a day or 8 333 dollars a month to make that a reality"", ""so one of the number one things that I would always do is you'd hold off to get more experience you're always are waiting for more experience into that next thing you see this with people getting jobs just thinking I'm gonna work this job for five years so I have enough experience myself I always really waited to start a high investment long term vision of a company because I was thinking well I need to make a little bit more money I need to save up a little bit more money to do this I need to get a little bit more experience in marketing what you need to understand is you're really gonna get the gist of about anything within six months of doing it I'm not saying you're going to master it completely but you're gonna have enough experience where you need to start getting out of your comfort zone see what you're gonna be really tempted to do is you're gonna find something that works in your 20s and because you don't realize you actually have an extreme limitation on time and you're missing tons of opportunities by not leaving your comfort zone you're gonna become an old dog with an old trick very quickly you're gonna find something that works and you're going to stick to it whether it's a job or a business model and you're gonna lock yourself in to that because you have a scarcity mindset when it comes to money for example I was stuck in business models that we're generating me one to two million dollars per year and I wouldn't give in to business models that I really wanted to get into and long term we're clearly the best choices clearly the best choices over a 10-year period clearly the best choices but I wouldn't because I was building experience and you don't want to kill what's working now and focusing on what's working now is short-term it's based around scarcity because you don't want to lose what's working now going from making a million dollars a year to making a hundred thousand a year or even like getting funding for your company and barely making it seems unthinkable but that seems unthinkable and when you think about in the short-term money mindset it is unthinkable but when you're actually looking at the fact that money is replenishable and that time is very limited the long term sessions are the only thing that makes sense because over the span of ten years those long-term decisions if you just look at them next to each other one-year decisions versus 10-year decisions the ten-year ones are always the best decisions even if they don't pay off because you only have so much time to make ten-year decisions you don't have an unlimited amount of time to make these long-term decisions you really between 20 and 45 have about six to seven really long term decisions you want to make and so you want to start those long term decisions as soon as possible and start breaking out of your comfort zone as soon as possible so you can get into those long-term higher payoff decisions and so sticking to your tricks that are working or sticking into something for experience that's comfortable to you that's usually where 20 year olds are gonna get messed up at I should have I had plenty of money to be investing in the SAS company I am now and working on really big really big ambitious projects when I was in my twenties"", ""i know that there are people that are going to want their photographs taken this is a very in demand skill and as a result i'm able to charge a lot of money for it back in high school and college i was actually able to make over a hundred dollars per hour doing this and if something were to happen like be pandemic again yes there might be a little bit less demand for photographs but that demand is still there and i'm still able to turn that skill into an income a lot of people think that these skills are hard to obtain but the truth is that a lot of these skills can be learned within a few months and so if you think about in terms of an roi perspective learning these types of high value skills like copywriting email

going to get funded I actually think that debt financing is going to get funded uh the margin financing isn't an issue and so really the only potential loophole here is that something squirrely happens with that Equity financing commitment letter now the equity financing some of that money is coming from Elon Musk but some of that money is coming from other people like the following firms like Apollo Global Management Inc and 6th Street Partners had been in discussions to contribute billions of dollars via preferred Equity stake before musk declared the deal dead this is from Bloomberg musk had been looking to raise as much as six billion dollars from preferred Equity investors as a way to reduce the amount of cash he had to provide himself to do the deal in the transaction financing for the transaction includes about 13 billion dollars of debt led by Morgan Stanley we already talked about that part right now Reuters via Bloomberg is reporting that Apollo and 6th Street are no longer in talks with Elon Musk to provide financing for the deal there's talk on Wall Street that they were never even really interested from the get-go"", ""and that states here that as described above if the conditions to parents and acquisition Subs obligations to complete the merchant are merger are satisfied and Elon Musk basically fails to consummate the merger as required including because of the following Equity debt and or margin financing is not funded Elon Musk parent will be required to pay a termination fee of 1 billion dollars now this is really interesting because at first I thought the three reasons he'd be able to cancel would actually just be two it'd basically just be if margin isn't funded or debt isn't funded but let's break these down one at a time and see where there's an interesting potential loophole maybe for Elon Musk so first debt financing isn't funded Elon Musk right now has about a 13 billion dollar loan uh commitment from Morgan Stanley and it is one heck of an expensive loan or at least it has gotten very expensive here is the section that talks about the interest rate from the debt financing commitment letter and it shows us that Elon Musk pays approximately sofr plus 4.75 or 4.5 let's just go conservative and say 4.5 percent as the spread on top of whatever sofr is well sofr has exploded it's gone from about 30 basis points to over 3 percent that means the following which I found on Twitter from this person at realmeet Kevin think interest rates going up hurts just ask Elon Musk his 12.5 billion dollar loan approximately 13."", ""musk said that at the time he had already received a verbal though unequivocal commitment from the Saudi fund to finance a take private deal worried that the news story would reveal the purported Accord musk said that he sent the Tweet to ensure that all investors had access to equal information the Saudis fund representative Yasir later denied through media reports and in a private text message to musk that funding was assured this is ass covering musk said of al-rumani's text it does not describe the reality of the situation so Elon is suggesting that Yasir is attempting to distance himself from any Financial culpability or liability in regards to his tweet he is is basically saying I've got nothing to do with this now I personally believe that Elon is telling the truth about the deal I'm not sure if his tweet was truly motivated though by the thought of informing shareholders or by his overgrown ego the reason I'm reviewing this is that Elon is fighting a lot of battles that I expect are going to continue to weigh on the price of the Tesla stock and that risk is something that the market is going to have to price in which in the course of time will continue to suppress the price of the stock not today but soon let's take a final look at the charts on Tesla I'm going to show you a longer view of the charts this is the weekly view which means that each candle represents a full week in the markets and as we move into the recession of 2023 it's going to be useful to see how companies are performing more broadly over the course of the much bigger picture of time the bullish view of Tesla's charts flipped to bearish in April of 2022 when the momentum of sellers took control by driving the stock below the 50 percent level on the RSI since then the Bears have dominated the stock and it's been in Decline and by the end of December 2022 Tesla became for the first time in the weekly chart oversold if you had dollar cost average that entire period you would be up at least 25 to 30 percent right now if we go purely by the charts Tesla is still in Bear territory and the trend is still down the current Spike up over the last two weeks is very likely purely a dead cat bounce before you get all fired up let me give you a technical mile marker that I'm going to be watching to change my view of that it's the 40 level on the RSI on the weekly chart this has held some weight in my view in the past and currently for Tesla it has been a barrier and it's been a support in the past when we see Tesla break close and climb above the 40 level on the RSI then we may have a confirmation of a new bullish Trend in just a moment I'm going to share a couple of hot stocks to put put on your watch list before I do quick station break for

the cooler the type of people that want to work for it usually are that's that's another cool lesson right there but look at your bozos and then get really serious because you can do so much more

And it's also almost directly correlated with the stock market. You want your assets doing different things at different times. And if your real estate investment takes a dip at the same time as your stock market investment, that essentially defeats the purpose of diversification. And again, not to mention, as we spoke to earlier, those publicly traded REITs are often lower in returns than private real state investments. And there is a lot less transparency because you really have no idea what exactly it is that you are investing in. In a little bit here we're gonna open up my Fundrise account and you're gonna be amazed at the level of transparency Fundrise offers showing you exactly what your money is invested in. Now, lastly, before we get into that live demo here, I want to cover the Fundrise fees so you are familiar with them.

start getting really good when you buy into something like an S&P500 index your investment is weighted by the market cap of each company meaning the bigger the market cap the more of your money goes to that particular investment in this case if you invested a hundred dollars into something like spy seven dollars would go into apple 5.9 to microsoft 3.75 to amazon and that continues until the smallest company only gets 0.014 of your money however in michael's case he's buying an equal proportion to every single company his goldfish picks that increases his chances of picking a smaller company that will see a higher return beating wall street bets and then making a video on youtube to flaunt the fact that you beat the brightest hedge fund managers in the world with a fish this same experiment was also simulated a thousand times back in 2013 with another goldfish and as you can see from the S&P500 in black the goldfish beat that return 96.4 percent of the time over a three-year period by an average of over 14 percent however at this point you probably got to ask yourself if doing this is so effective and it makes so much money why isn't everyone doing it well the reason is simple risk even though smaller companies outperformed by 1.7 96 of the time they also experienced significantly more volatility meaning just as much as they went up they also went down like if we compare the top 000 growth companies with the top 2 thousand value companies we could see that nearly every price movement in the value category is magnified by at least 20 to 50 percent and risk is something that every investor needs to consider when they think to themselves how much money do i want to risk versus how much do i want to make and for most investors choosing the short-term volatility of investing in completely random stocks usually does not beat the safety of investing in 500 different companies throughout an index and earning slightly less my own monkey portfolio is a perfect example of this like i mentioned throughout 2021 10 randomly pick stocks outperformed the S&P500 by a full 13 but in 2022 when i repeated this experiment again the monkey portfolio lost percent during a time where the S&P500 was only down three and a half percent does that mean the experiment is flawed or i just got unlucky no when the market goes up the monkey is statistically likely to do even better"", ""and they found that their monkey portfolio consistently beat the stock market by an average of 1.7 percent a year 96 of the time and it doesn't even stop there a goldfish's stock picks were simulated over a thousand times and beat the market by an average of 14.5 percent over three years there's also a cat who beat the market by eight percent a monkey named adam who beat jim cramer a chimpanzee who beat 94 of russian bankers and even a crypto trading hamster who beat warren buffett believe it or not there's actually a formulated reason why animals are able to get such a high return and it has nothing to do with luck chance or a secret world of headless chickens is depicted in south park instead it has to do with the strategy being used to pick stocks that tend to do well consistently over and over again and here's what they discovered research conducted in 2013 found that by randomly selecting 30 stocks out of the top 1 000 companies and buying them all in equal proportions you're increasing the chances that such a portfolio would contain smaller stocks which have the potential for even higher growth and because monkeys didn't get emotional and panic sell the moment jim cramer comes out with a spooky headline that led to an outperformance of the entire market year after year as proof of this between 1980 and 2015 smaller stocks returned 11.24 annual growth on average while large stocks returned eight percent so that just means when 30 stocks are picked at random while investing an equal amount in each you're more likely to include smaller stocks which would boost the portfolio's return when compared to an overall index and uh oops voila you beat the market now even though this sounds like the ideal way to invest before i have boo pick another 10 stocks for 2022 you're probably wondering well graham if it's really that easy then why is it everybody doing it"", ""it's not just random luck either because so many animals have proven to beat the market time and time again that a year ago i created my own experiment where i personally invested a hundred thousand dollars in 10 randomly picked stocks by the youtube monkey boo and guess what to my surprise at the end of the year the youtube monkey generated a 41 return and beat the entire S&P500 by 13 so even though michael reeve's algorithm i mean goldfish seems really really impressive just like a magic trick it's all an illusion and as it turns out there's a very simple reason why all of these animal portfolios do so incredibly well see when people pick stocks they do so by trying to profit from inefficiencies in the market that just means that they pick stocks which should in theory be worth more in the future based on their growth fundamentals projected earnings seasonality and trends so if professionals have all of these resources available at their disposal to pick the next big opportunities why can't they on a consistent basis better than an animal well that's what brings us to what's called the efficient market hypothesis this argues that the stock market makes no room for excess profits because everything is already fairly and accurately priced in or in other words stocks cannot be undervalued because its current price already includes its future growth value and earnings so the only way to make more money is by choosing riskier investments where the upside is directly proportional to the chance that you will lose money now of course there are investors like peter lynch or warren buffett who have outperformed the market over multiple decades but others argue that out of your probability at any given point in a market with enough people some will outperform the mean otherwise a winning strategy would only work until enough people figure it out at which point it would no longer be effective because everyone else is doing it but in the animals case the reason they perform so well is because it's kind of rigged in fact you could replace the animal with just about anything even a snail and it's going to do well just consider this research conducted in 2013 found that by randomly selecting 30 stocks out of a list of a thousand companies and buying them all in equal proportion you're increasing the likelihood that that portfolio would contain smaller stocks which have more potential for higher growth as proof of this between 1980 and 2015 smaller stocks returned over 11 on average while large stocks only returned 8 so that just means when animal stocks are picked at random while investing an equal amount in each you're more likely to include smaller companies which have a higher return than the overall index and voila he beat the market but now what about michael's situation because after all he bought into the S&P500 where every single company is worth over 5 billion dollars""]"

So the basic Brita water filter which is the pitcher that you put in the fridge costs $16.99 and the first filter is included. Now they recommend changing that filter every two months, which means you would have to purchase five additional filters throughout the course of one year. Now those filters on Amazon are going to run you $4.50 a piece. So over the course of one year, the cost of the initial Brita water filter pitcher and five additional filters is going to be $39.49, compared to spending over $250 on bottled water. So as far as drinking water goes, you have three options here. Number one, spending next to nothing drinking tap water."", ""But not everyone is. And a lot of empty plastic bottles end up in the trash can. Now I understand where this comes in because it's extremely convenient to have bottled water. You don't wanna have to worry about filling up a pitcher in the fridge. Or maybe you don't like the taste of your tap water. But it's honestly costing you a lot of money and it's just bad for the environment. And honestly guys, comparing the cost of bottled water to tap water is unbelievable. According to a study by Convergex group, consumers are spending 300 times the cost of tap water on bottled water. So can you think of anything else out there that you would spend 300 times more money on just for the convenience? And look, I understand that a lot of people simply do not like the taste of tap water or their worried about what's in the tap water.

Solutions and even more going on on the back end and we're going to try to dissect and explain all of it as we go keep an eye out throughout this video because when you see this screen that means we're about to enter another Bridge battery each bridge will be labeled with a number that's how many Bridge instances we've gone through so far we're also going to mention which chain we're starting from and which chain we're moving to along with the amount of gas and the type of assets needed to pay gas on that Network keep an eye out for these as we move throughout the Expo without any further Ado let's get started to begin with we're over on ethereum with some eth Assets in our wallet hit the like And subscribe let's go today we begin on the ethereum mainnet with 0.055 ethereum available for spending this is about a hundred dollars in today's money our first stop is seller Bridge here we have the option to swap between networks we're going to bridge first from ethereum to polygon processing a swap transaction and select and confirm after a few minutes here we can see the transaction pending on the Block Explorer once confirmed we'll be able to see the balance in our wallet at wallet.polagon.technology at this point we've completed our first Bridge transaction once the funds settle we'll be ready to interact with them now over on polygon for our next Bridge transaction we're going to be using synapse protocol over at synapse we're able to take a look at the available tokens for bridging unfortunately ethereum is not supported between polygon and Kronos our intended destination Network however using one-inch protocol we can swap for usdc assets and then swap them back to eth later on we also have the advantage of using the fusion router here the fusion router will allow us to perform this transaction without using any gas at all here we need to give permission for one inch protocol to use our eth assets signing a transaction to approve signing with our wallet here does not incur a gas fee once approved we're able to process a transaction swapping our eth assets for usdc on polygon once the transaction confirms we can head back over to synapse over at synapse we now have the option to bridge our usdc assets using the protocol here we'll select Chronos our destination Network specifying the max amount of usdc in our wallet we can initiate the bridge transaction"", ""so next stop we're bridging to ethereum l2s these networks are a little different because the ethereum that we're moving over will actually become gas on the L2 this is not true for the other networks we're visiting and because of that we need to separate out our Bridge amount from the amount that we're keeping in the wallet for gas we can do this by checking the block Explorer to see how much we received following the previous Bridge let's take a look next we'll be moving our ethereum between the two most popular layer 2 defy environments on ethereum specifically arbitrum and optimism navigating to Stargate we see that we have a bridge route available here here we want to verify the amount of eth that was received on the arbitrum side after moving from Kronos once verified we can paste that amount into our Bridge interface over on Stargate with the amount specified we're ready to process the bridge transaction select and confirm and monitoring the interface for confirmation after a few minutes we can see that our assets have arrived via Stargate to optimism like with arbitrum we're going to take a look at the fully transferred amount in order to figure out how much we're going to send over to Avalanche here we can see this amount of ethereum coming in through Stargate protocol a little bit ago before we can Bridge our assets to Avalanche we need to swap them for wrapped ethereum assets we can do this using one-inch protocol here we see that slippage is not a factor but there is a transfer fee involved selecting confirm swap we'll swap our eth assets for wrapped eth next we'll return to seller bridge and move the entirety of our wrapped ethereum assets over to Avalanche first approving wrap teeth for spending by seller Bridge once approved we're ready to transfer our assets again confirming the transfer on our metamask wallet once confirmed on optimism we just need to wait for the transaction to confirm on Avalanche as well again this may take a few minutes we made it that was Bridge five we're nearly halfway there it's a great time for us to talk a little bit about how these Bridges work now there are a few different types we have mint and burn as it's often called isonomes call it lock box receipt because because the lock box is where the tokens are stored on the origin Network and the receipt is what you receive on the destination Network representative of the value of that token the other model is interlocking pools of liquidity and that's what we see with multi-chain the protocol we were using earlier in either case though we're processing a transaction on both networks and that's an important aspect to how this works whenever you're bridging you need to wait not only for confirmation of the first transaction but also the confirmation on the destination Network once that's received our assets are available and fully bridged by viewing the black Explorer for Avalanche snowtrace.io we can take a look at our assets as they come through the bridge selecting erc20 token transactions here we see wrapped ethereum removing the filter we're able to see all the incoming transactions for this asset next using Wormhole we can move the wrap teeth that we just transferred over now wrapped eth.e over to Oasis selecting next prompts us to confirm that transaction here we need to select manual payment as we will need to process a transaction using rows in order to complete this bridge selecting approve will approve our current supply of wrapped teeth for transfer we'll select max amount and then next approve once complete we're ready to transfer our assets via portal Bridge select and confirm and then confirming again with our wallet and paying the requested fee once the transaction is complete and with Oasis Emerald Rose in our wallet we're able to redeem the funds on the Oasis Network this is the Oasis Emerald Paradigm an evm layer on Oasis selecting confirm and then signing again with our wallet so that last Bridge transaction moved our eth assets from Avalanche over to Oasis Network actually the Oasis Emerald Paradigm which is the evm layer now that they're there there isn't a lot we can do with them because liquidity is too thin so instead we need to bridge them back luckily we can do this with limited slippage let's take a look taking a look at the Oasis Foundation Oasis emerald block Explorer we're able to see our recent token transfers this includes the wrapped eth.e coming into our wallet selecting the asset wrapped ether through Wormhole we see that we're the first person to use this particular Bridge route in about a year and that there are only 19 addresses holding this particular asset for this reason it's possible that we don't have any other options for our ether on this chain without moving it back through the same Bridge here we again select the max amount before bridging back to Avalanche this time approving our Bridge deep assets again for spending this time by Oasis Network and then selecting the transfer option to complete the transfer finally signing another transaction to redeem the assets back on Avalanche next stop is one of the newest Bridge protocols on the scene squid router we haven't played a lot with Squid router"", ""why but it's not evm it's common to see them launching an evm chain I would consider this generally a bullish sign for a protocol that they're keeping up with the times and looking to innovate wherever possible let's look at the next Bridge step as we continue with assets over on kava now we can move to satellite.money selecting Cava from the origin chain and polygon from the destination chain we'll go ahead and move back over to polygon this time swapping back to wrap teeth here we initiate the swap transaction which is a five stage process signing first with our wallet selecting Max and then next and then approving the bridge transaction fee next we're asked asked to sign one more transaction in order to process the transfer once complete we can see a summary at the bottom and we have an option to make another transfer so here we are back on polygon we've almost reached the end of our massive bridging Expo but we've got one more step to go to put us back on ethereum it's going to be a doozy so let's take a look at this point returning to wallet.polygon.technology we're able to view our Wallet balance on polygon here we can see that our eth assets have returned to our wallet and that we're still holding the majority of them in exploring the different cross-chain protocols available for moving assets from polygon to other networks including back to ethereum in many cases the fee to return our assets to the ethereum mainnet nearly matched the amount that we were holding this was the case with connexed a bridge we didn't use this time but one we have used in the past we had similar issues when exploring new protocols where the ethereum fee took a long time to generate and ultimately was more than the assets we were holding situations where the preview amount was very close to our origin amount indicated that a gas fee needed to be paid in Matic at today's market rate this would be about a 95 gas fee this prompted us to return to Seabridge our original Network used to bridge from ethereum to polygon in order to bridge back the reason being that the final received amount after gas fees does not exceed the balance that we're holding and only uses about half of our resources selecting transfer and then confirm transfer and then confirming with our software wallet processes the bridge transaction selecting pending from the top right allows us to see the transaction in process once complete we can see the bridge amount reflected in our balance with our assets back on ethereum our steps are not quite complete our final procedure in bridging is to turn our remaining eth into native Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain here's how we do that using Thor swap found at app.thoreswap.finance Swap here we have the option to swap native ethereum for Native Bitcoin connecting our metamask wallet first here the maximum amount that we can select is adjusted based on the amount we'll need for gas here we'll paste in a Bitcoin address that we control normally we'd be able to process this swap transaction with limited fees receiving our assets over on the Bitcoin Network unfortunately due to the congestion on bitcoin created by Bitcoin ordinals we're unable to do this at this time as Thor chain has paused Bitcoin withdraws for the time being it's likely that new updates to the Bitcoin blockchain will fix this restoring access to this interoperability method going forward""]"

have been some notable investors who've recently taken a large position in Baba now I'm taking the risk of going long into earnings Baba has had some challenges but one of the bullish Dynamics surrounding the stock right now is the stimulus money that China is pumping into the economy so China has shifted from stimulating the economy through infrastructure spending which is what they've mostly been known for to consumption spending for the very first time this is new and it's going to position Chinese stocks and cryptos to potentially lead the true bull market which I believe is still ahead of us all of the consumption that is going to be done in China over the next two years is going to have direct impact on the corporate earnings of Alibaba this may be the last time that you could get Alibaba below a hundred dollars China has upgraded their GDP Target this year to five percent which some believe is going to be conservative in light of the consumption stimulus and the

of Qualcomm which is broadcom stock ticker avgo a stock that I hold within my dividend portfolio is up 45 year-to-date but Qualcomm has been left behind why is that number one the recovery in China has been a lot slower than many had expected at the end of last year China reopened completely taking away their covet zero restrictions but many companies baked in a lot of growth expectations with the reopening of China that just hasn't come to fruition yet secondly handset sales are down across the globe down 17 percent for Qualcomm alone when the company reported their Q2 earnings they were actually in line from an EPS standpoint and they beat on sales but the company also gave pretty light guidance EPS came in at 2.15 sense which I mentioned was inline revenues for the quarter came in at 9.28 billion and analysts were expecting 9.1 billion there's the beat on revenues but in terms of guidance Q3 sales are expected to come in at 8.5 but the street was looking for 9.14 billion and EPS guidance also came in light at a dollar eighty when analysts were looking for 2.16 per share definitely some huge gaps there between analysts and management Qualcomm also had negative cash flow during the quarter as their cash position decreased by 1.3 billion however they remain cash flow positive on the year thus far in terms of free cash flow Qualcomm generated 3.7 billion in free cash flow through the first half of the year compared to paying out dividends of 1.7 billion which equates to a free cash flow yield of 46 percent which tells me the dividend is plenty safe at the moment speaking of the dividend Qualcomm pays an annual dividend that yields 2.9 percent and over the past five years investors have seen the company increase the dividend and an average of 5.2 percent per year so not a ton in terms of dividend growth although the last two hikes have been above the average rate which is positive now for valuation analysts are looking for FY 2024 adjusted EPS of 9.57 cents per share which equates to an earnings multiple of 12.1 times for comparative purposes over the past five years shares of Qualcomm have traded at an average earnings multiple of 17.1 times and

exceeds 1 million us dollars in its twitter feed this arbitrary threshold can be a huge problem when it comes to measuring how much of an impact a well movement could have on the price of a cryptocurrency this is because of market depth market depth tells you how much money is required to push the price of a cryptocurrency up or down on any given cryptocurrency exchange this can easily be checked on coingecko or coin market cap under the markets tab the more money it takes to push up or push down the price by two percent the greater the market debt that crypto has here's why that's relevant if you see 10 million dollars worth of bitcoin being transferred from a wallet to an exchange with a market depth of 20 or 30 million dollars to the downside even if all that bitcoin is sold immediately it will have a negligible effect on price however most altcoins have market depths in the millions and sometimes less this means a whale movement of that size would decimate the price of that altcoin as it would bleed the order books dry what's more is that sometimes an altcoins whale movement is so small in dollar terms that it's not even picked up by whale tracking tools even then it could still be enough to crash the price as such it's important to take note of the market depth for a cryptocurrency when you're trying to determine what effect a whale movement will actually have on its price and not immediately assume that the sky is falling or that we're going to the moon whenever whale alert makes a tweet this brings me to the second factor that's often forgotten about whale movements and that's that not all whale movements are created equal because most altcoins are heavily correlated to bitcoin a bitcoin whale movement could crush your favorite alt even though there was no significant whale activity taking place on that altcoins blockchain moreover as we approach the peak of this bull market certain whale transactions will become more important than others here's what i mean by that on any given day we see a few dozen whale movements for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum some of these are large a few of them are massive and they have a predictable effect on price what you don't see every day is an old bitcoin wallet making a transaction for the first time in a very long while transactions from these dormant bitcoin wallets can seriously shake up the market and that's because they suggest that prices have risen high enough that even the most hardcore huddlers want to sell usually these ancient whale movements make the crypto news and are sometimes noted by whale trackers as well luckily most of these have been small wallet to wallet transactions in recent months however if we start to approach that 100k or 200k mark and you start to see some of these old wallets start to move a bunch of their bitcoin onto exchanges it might mean we are at or near the top in terms of price for this cycle it's also important to remember that the significance of a whale transaction depends on the tokenomics of the cryptocurrency and which whale wallet the transaction is coming from there's a difference between the largest dogecoin holder dumping 10 million doge and a smaller dogecoin wallet doing the same if large whale transactions from a wallet to an exchange are consistently coming from the largest holder of a cryptocurrency that's inequitably distributed it might be time to abandon ship the same rule applies to transactions made from cryptocurrency wallets belonging to famous crypto billionaires like vitalik buterin vitalik is known for selling a substantial chunk of his ethereum near the peak of the previous bull market now unlike most crypto billionaires vitalik has made his wallet address public"", ""they'll just use an otc desk anyways these facts fall on deaf ears to the average whale watcher who wrongly assumes that the minting of stable coins means we're about to see a mega pump this makes them privy to manipulation by big investors who could push up the price by a couple of percentage points following the stable coin print to give the illusion that something is happening retail investors fomo into the pump and get dumped on by the smart money the same thing happens when it comes to whale movements on and off exchanges without the context of the first two factors i mentioned earlier reacting to the naked implications of these large transactions is a great way to get wrecked by big investors understanding that the smart money is aware of the ways the average crypto trader reacts is the basis of the wyckoff method which i explained in depth in a recent video you'd be wise to factor wyckoff into your whale watching activities and you can find my video about it using the link in the top right on-chain analysis is something that i've had the luxury of exploring to the fullest extent as someone who's tried both paid and unpaid on-chain indicators and signals i can tell you that you can get a pretty good bang without having to put down a buck the primary difference between the free and paid versions of most on-chain metrics is that the paid versions are more refined and give you more options when it comes to sifting through the data when it comes to whale movements what you get from using free tools like whale alert and look into bitcoin.com are more or less the same as what you'd find on glass node and crypto quant however an indicator is only as good as the trader who's using it""]"

I got a two year degree in Electrical Construction and now here I am making YouTube videos so obviously I'm not using my college education but it cost me altogether $12,000 over the course of two years and I was fortunate enough to have some money from my grandfather that paid for college so I was blessed to not have to go into debt but even so, I went community college to keep that expense as low as possible.

let's include the example of a middleman tenant the faucet the owner fix this leaking again property manager in a professional and communicative manner let me see what I can find out so I can make sure that issue is resolved for you right manager isn't giving anything away but the manager is being communicative that's so important in reducing people's stress now the property manager knowing what the problem might be your based on the description of the tenant could make phone calls a plumber we got a leaking faucet how much do you think it's going to cost to fix this ballpark okay perfect great management rate even better hey owner that faucet sprung a leak again it's going to cost us about 125 to 150 dollars to replace or fix or whatever are you okay with approving this repair so I could get this handle owner no problem done owners stress level is virtually zero because the owner gets the message hey here's a problem but the owner also immediately gets here's the solution owner all they have to do is reply and go WOW okay"", ""today we're talking about the number one rule of property management what you should never say to a tenant first to make sense of this rule we need to understand the middleman phenomenon or middle person to make you gender neutral although middleman rolls off the tongue a little easier so we're gonna stick with that one middleman is a slang term for an intermediary that provides a service but also charges a fee or a commission because of that it's sort of built a negative connotation over time but if you understand the concept of a middleman you'll understand the concept of what you should never tell a tenant coming up let's analyze this just like in real estate sales with buyers on one side and sellers on the other tenants sit on one side across the table from landlords and they each have different desires and perspectives because of this opposing relationship they naturally tend to have an adversarial relationship with the other party that is even though they're working together for their common benefit that is the tenant gets a place to live and the landlord gets rental income they tend to have an atmosphere relationship because the tenant generally wants to pay less in rent and be able to do more such as have dogs or paint walls whatever colors they want whereas a landlord wants to make less changes to the property do less repairs but collect more on rent the same is true for buyers and sellers buyers want to pay less sellers won again more there's no surprise here but this natural dichotomy creates a tinderbox for emotions guilt appeals to pity fake friendships and drama now this isn't to say that there aren't some landlords that don't have excellent relationships with their tenants or can be friends with their tenants and can get along and the bottom line is in almost any relationship when things are going good everybody's happy it's when things get a little bit more complicated that friend relationships can very quickly turn ugly now how does the middleman come into play with this and what should I never tell a tenant let's explain the concept of the middleman phenomenon by talking about a property manager I'm the property manager a property manager is a classic middleman who is incentivized by both the tenant being happy and the owner being happy to make the entire transactional process of a tenancy significantly easier and stress-free for all parties involved when both sides have expectations hopefully set by that great property manager and both sides follow the rules of the agreement that have been created again hopefully by that great property manager then generally the level of stress and a tendency can be very low all of this is under the guidance of that middle person see the property manager doesn't just make the process of a landlord tenancy relationship simpler by facilitating paperwork photos repairs or putting a property on the market a property manager is a classic case of the middleman somebody who can remove emotion from discussions convey local norms of what customs our culture dictate happen in a certain rental market balance the priorities of both the landlord and the tenant in a reasonable manner of course and conduct business in a communicative way so that nobody feels like they're left in the dark ultimately they filter out the drama and get to the facts they get to the bottom of things so that they can handle things in a reasonable manner the nature of a middleman now let's make an example of no property manager involved tenant has problem talks to owner hay owner that faucet you worked on last time is leaking again owners typical reaction ah whiny tenant go screw yourself the order may not actually say that"", ""well I guess I have to go kill some ants this is super common by the way tenants almost always try to ask for more and more services so we have to keep their expectations in check as landlords or property managers so having this property manager be a filter for emotion and stress levels actually creates less litigious situations whereas resentment builds so high on either side that so many self-managing landlords end up with those cocktail stories where they talked about nightmare scenarios they had with tenants or how they ended up in court with tenants and guess what guess who usually wins in court the tenants that's where the expression tenants and toilets comes from people don't want to deal with tenants and toilets because it can be stressful and that emotion and stress combined creates a disastrous situation that's why the middleman is so powerful but what is the big secret what should you never tell a tenant well now that you understand this this is exactly what you should never tell a tenant never ever ever ever tell a tenant that you are the owner of the property we're not suggesting lie but here's a psychological fact that happens when you are the owner and you tell a tenant that you're the owner as soon as a tenant knows who the owner is every time they write that rent check they picture the face of the owner and how maybe they're paying for that Beamer lease the owner has or their mortgage or whatever and it builds resentment the bottom line is one human feels like they are giving somebody else something it's very weird when people rent from apartment complex they don't have this issue because it's a corporation for some reason that feels different when people write checks to a property manager it's like they're just paying to a company feels different they paid their home loan to a bank feels different but when they write a check to a homeowner and they see that homeowner buying beer at the grocery store like my rents paying for that beer and I'm struggling to make the payment that resentment the fact is there's nothing anybody can do about that it happens it could be avoided by preventing the tenant from finding out who the owner is again we're not suggesting lie I've got some suggestions here and some tips for how to actually handle this but the biggest advice is if you have a property manager don't be that owner that wants to show their ego and show how great they are for when the tenant goes to move in here comes the owner with the key to that house""]"

because we want to focus on the important features the only thing that the listener needs to know now is that if he or she buys a german wound at a negative yield so let's say of 25 basis points then if he hedges the currency risk by selling the euro currency forward to convert the proceeds over the hedge horizon into dollars he is selling the forward exchange rate at a higher price than the spot exchange rate so the difference between the forward exchange and the spot exchange rate can then be considered as an additional yield or carry that's actually coming from the hedge so even though the bond has negative yield the hedge creates a positive carry now in the example that i gave you where the differential is three percent this forward currency hedging generates three percent yield so you take three percent and add it to the negative 25 basis points and voila euro got a negatively yielding 10-year german boon now yielding positive 2.75 for a u.s investor similarly a three-month german boon yielding negative 50 basis points will become a two and a half percent hedging yield in this example and a two-year boon will become as of that writing 2.3 now yields have compressed quite a bit the interest rate differential has compressed quite a bit since then but many of these uh arithmetic calculations still hold in other words you can still turn negatively yielding bonds into positively yielding bonds just through the act of hedging now look at it from the perspective of a euro-based investor the act of hedging the currency risk reduces the yield of a 10-year maturity treasury note to negative 83 basis points so positively yielding bond at that time positive yielding u.s treasury note turns into a negatively yielding treasury note once you hedge it in other words it converts a positive u.s yield to negatively yields for a u.s for a euro-based investor"", ""so the chart in the paper that's on forbes you can see the various combinations for the u.s euro and japanese 10-year maturity government bonds from the perspective of investors in all these different currencies and countries so even though every country in this list has a much lower unhedged yield than the us treasury and here i had a loan exception being italy which we'll also address in a second the hedge yields for every country's bond is higher than the yield of the u.s 10-year treasury this is an example of the carry trade at its finest and potentially at its most dangerous by taking a long-term low yielding asset and by using a derivative contract the low yield is now turned into a high yield temporarily and vice versa now the state of affairs where the u.s treasury's lower head shield than any other country is not completely an accident global central banks are easing policy pretty aggressively and as of this writing the u.s had not eased policy aggressively subsequently it has eased policy quite substantially like i commented on during that write-up and in the post-covet environment yields have indeed in the u.s been cut quite drastically now the lower policy rates in foreign countries result in carry benefits both in their internal market and also in the external market so let's get into that for a second for example in europe very negatively yielding short-term yields for example short-term meals went down to about i think negative 90 basis points result in positive carry even for a 10-year bond at negative 25 basis points for internal european buyers such as indexers or banks in europe this is because if they buy a bond at negative 0.25 then with a fixed yield curve shape the bond rolls down towards the more negative shorter term yield which results in a positive total return so even though the yield itself is negative the roll down and carry result in a positive expected return now the increasing target two deficits that's the balance of the central banks between the italian central bank and the german central bank and others are indeed a symptom of the fact that money is being recycled from italy back into german boons presumably because despite negative yields the carry and safety of being in boons is worth the risk to italian holders of euros and of italian bonds and obviously the haircut on boons is much lower so the boons can be used for repo and for other financing operations in addition by reducing short-term interest rates and the consequent application of the covered interest rate parity relationship the central banks are also encouraging unknowingly possibly the kind of speculation that has been discussed just a few minutes ago that by external buying of negatively yielding assets and converting them to positively unique assets you're allowing for external arbitrage now this state of affairs is not the first time it might sound unique but it has a very classic life cycle and it is deeply related to other forms of carry trades the currency carry trade is also very deeply related to the volatility in currencies and other asset classes and i wrote a paper in the journal of fixed income on this topic a few years ago the fact that currency volatility has remained incredibly low over the last decade has mitigated so far forced unwinds of leveraging the scary trade but the question is can it last indefinitely and currency volatility is extremely low so people think that there is no risk in currency carry trades but as we know when it unwinds it unwinds in a very rapid and uncontrolled fashion now one scenario in which currency volatility can rise sharply is a hiccup in risk assets that results in a rush into u.s fixed income assets for just protection of portfolios or due to an aggressive rate cut by the fed"", ""maybe even more so so this scenario has clearly not worked out as i had anticipated but if rates at some points start to rise for whatever reason because of more issuance increasing deficits or some of the legal ramifications of the court judgment for the judicial court judgment in germany it is possible that short rates in europe could start rising and hence the pickup from the from the yield differential would be substantially narrowed this is not a high probability forecast but just a risk to be very aware of now let us apply the same analysis for a japanese yen based investor and then a euro-based investor for a yen-based investor the same table shows that u.s treasuries are the worst yield of a bunch on a hedge yield basis they're actually very negative so in this case because of financial alchemy or anti-alchemy this time gold u.s treasuries is being converted into dirt but the question then leads once one led to is should we prefer to buy u.s 10-year treasuries as a yield of at this time 2.08 unhedged or italy at that time was 252 on a hedge basis in the first case if we had preferred to buy unhedged u.s treasuries we would be taking currency risk but no credit risk in the second case if we are taking no currency risk but we are taking a whole amount of italian credit risk in a late cycle environment credit risk can be more dangerous than currency risk for a european-based investor france provides no yield and italy provides the only other positive yield because of the hedging the u.s is still again at the bottom of the whole earth curve across globe what is not shown in this chart was that for a u.s based investor but its fact was true the longest duration german boons which at the time of the writing was 32 basis points currently they're actually close to zero percent actually yielded 3.3 percent currently they'll be yielding much less than that and for euro investor the 30-year us bond would only yield negative 35 basis points in other words even as monetary policy was easy investors would be tempted by the yields in the longest most duration sensitive part of the youth curve primarily because the currency hedge carry so finally putting it all together the point is this whenever there is a type of alchemy that turns high into low and low into high secondly it uses a yield curve mismatch third it is exposed to shocks to volatility fourth""]"

three major shifts that i'll experience in my lifetime if i'd been stuck in my ways and not taking notice of these changes then my investments would have been left in the past just like the coal industry so before investing in a stock i always think about whether a future shift in sector will have a positive or negative impact on that company but how do i predict when the best time to buy is you don't but there's a strategy i use to get around this and it's called dollar cost averaging let's imagine you were to invest once a month for three months month one the stock might cost you two hundred dollars month two hundred and fifty dollars a month three hundred and thirty dollars of course if you knew it was going to dip to 130 you'd have bought then however no one knows how low the price will go but by doing this instead of investing all your money in month one when your stock was at 200 you actually lower your average buying price to 160 dollars this is also known as buying the dip instead of getting scared and selling like the majority of people would the idea is to buy more because it's like having a garage sale and if you've done all your research and you like the company then the stock is at a bargain price"", ""so that's number two number three number three is I wish I knew that you can dollar-cost average Bitcoin all right now I've been investing in stocks and mutual funds since I've been like 18 years old so I've been doing that for a long time long time long term investing and I've been doing dollar-cost averaging for a long time and what dollar cost averaging is is basically investing a fixed dollar amount into an investment every month or every year on a on a fixed time period and just doing that and the coolest thing about dollar cost averaging is like Ron Popeil and his daytime rotisserie oven or whatever is called you can just set it and forget it so the coolest thing is is you can just set this up you can forget it and then automatically you're making money now this is just dollar cost averaging versus lump sum averaging for a year okay"", ""so let's imagine that you are saving for retirement and you're going to invest $1,000 every month in the ABC fund currently ABC is trading at $50 per share since you're investing $1,000 this month you're going to buy 20 shares which is $1,000 divided by $50 per share for now we are ignoring any Commission's which we will come back to in a minute right now your cost per share is $50 simple enough well next month ABC falls to $40 per share you invest the same $1000 this month that you did last month but this time you get 25 shares because the price is lower $1,000 divided by 40 at this point you own 45 shares and you have invested a total amount of $2,000 making your cost per share forty-four dollars and forty four cents which you get by dividing $2,000 the total amount invested by the 45 shares you own the following month ABC goes back to $50 per share so you get another 20 shares for the new $1000 now you have invested $3,000 and you own 65 shares your cost per share averages out to be 46 dollars and 15 cents so the theory with dollar cost averaging is that the higher the price of the fund goes the less shares you buy the lower it goes the more shares you buy assuming that you have an investment that you have done a good amount of research on and you are confident that over time it will rise in value dollar cost averaging gives you the advantage of making the volatility of the fund work in your favor this brings us to the potential downside in our scenario you invest $1,000 every month but what if you wanted instead to invest 250 dollars every week same amount as before but you're going to do it more often this is where the Commission's I mentioned before can hurt you so every time you place a trade you generally have to pay Commission if that Commission is $10 per trade if you only trade it once a month it will cost you $10 but if you did it weekly it will cost you $40 depending on the amount investing that $40 may or may not change your mind as to the frequency that you invest if you're investing just $50 per week which is $200 a month well that $40 cost is going to hurt a lot since it's a large percentage of the amount invested but if you're investing $1,000 per week that $40 doesn't hurt as much on a $4,000 monthly investment so in summary to make dollar cost averaging work for you have investments that you're confident in choose a consistent amount and a consistent time interval keep an eye on your commission costs and make sure that they don't get out of control relative to the amount you invested then stick with the program for the long run""]"

massive populace and if you look deep into it tons of manufacturers from tech to auto to generalized construction are based in that city foxconn which is the biggest assembler of apple's iphone and they assemble a lot of other apple products has a huge branch there as well the city is also known for their giant panda sanctuary which means if you're bullish on pandas these lockdowns are even more devastating right and i am always bullish on panda so i'm really a bag holder here so chengdu"", ""but it's also hey the economy we don't even have power to run the economy in a lot of areas on top of that china is having their worst heat wave on record for weeks now a power crunch caused by a record heat wave and accompanying drought has raked wrecked havoc across sichuan a province home to 80 million people in southwestern china its dim skyscrapers shut factories darkened subways and plunged homes and offices into rolling blackouts forcing air conditioning to be unplugged and killed thousands of poultry and fish at farms hit by electricity cuts the impact has been felt far and wide from the neighboring mega city of chuang queen and the eastern provinces along the yangtze river to the financial hub of shanghai where the iconic skyline went dark this week to save energy you literally have china going and rationing who gets power i would hate to live in an area where you have extreme heat droughts power shortages and overreaching government that i could not stand fourth and quite frankly this may be the biggest and hardest issue for china to get out of"", ""this massive massive influential city is going back into lockdown and while the government is currently saying it's going to be short other cities with short lockdowns ended up stretching out months and these restrictions have huge tolls imagine all the economic loss involved with forcing millions of residents to lock themselves away from society you don't have to think too hard to imagine what that's like for the economy most of us lived lighter versions of that for smaller amounts of time but in china those lockdowns just keep coming back over and over and over again and the worst part is that businesses when they're making decisions they have to factor in hey we don't know if we're even going to be able to operate all year we don't know if we're going to make it all season we don't know nobody knows when the next person's going to sneeze or cough and the whole thing's going to get shut down and then citizens are allegedly having to line up for mandatory covet testing that kills tons of time as well all of this is simply a huge huge inefficiency and waste of workers time that could otherwise be spent actually operating the economy which by the way china before this was one of the fastest growing economies consistently decade after decade and you think about how devastating it is for a country whose population is 1.4 billion and accounts for almost 20 percent of global population to be shutting down and barricading off various cities at random spontaneous points throughout the year and it explains why not only is this extremely dangerous for china but also for the global economy and everybody including you and me secondly building on this point major economic generators are being forced to shut down regularly china's economy is falling off a cliff because their economy is built largely on manufacturing and exports but they keep closing their manufacturing hub much of the time due to zero covid but also due to some other reasons on this list that we're going to get into but look at this data hither china's manufacturing pmi is registering a massive downtrend in activity a downtrend that hasn't been registered since some of the bigger lockdowns earlier this year in places like shanghai shenzhen and beijing many project this heading in the same direction straight down third and this is something that i don't see a lot of people talking about but china's having a lot of environmental problems according to the south china morning post extremely large chunks of china are either abnormally dry or in a moderate to extreme drought and this is a huge stinking problem because when you get to drought levels what happens well that's not just a massive water shortage but that's also something that leads to huge crop damage and or complete loss this is coming at a time where we already have huge shortages on a global scale in most crucial food commodities since july provinces and cities in southern china including in huay jiang shi hubai hunan were affected by drought i probably butchered each of those cities but i tried my best low water levels in the yangtze river increased pressure on hydroelectric power plants affecting water supply and electricity production for millions of people and many companies forcing the temporary closure of factories in some provinces so here we have yet another reason that factories are being shut down so it's not just coveted""]"

Benefit of the doubt, profitwithant, the Side Hustle King made a bit of a mistake. I don't know, I'm not really sure what number he was missing? Was it thousand dollars right now? Maybe that's what he meant? I mean, he added a couple zeros there. Was it 5,000 a month? I'm almost wondering, did he really make a mistake? Or did people call him out and he went back and waslike, oh, ooh. Either way, either way. I'm gonna give this guy the benefit of the doubt. But here, this is where it gets better. This is the part that I really, really wanna talk about because this is, this is why you gotta be careful, who you listen to on social media, because are a lot of people out there, that will claim that they know what they're doing, that they are successful.

And then this guy, Dr. Parik Patel, here goes on to say, sir, sir I love how he's speaking to him, sir, where this guy looks like he's in his mid forties, fifties or so. And he's talking to this guy who looks fairly young. This Nick guy, sir, this is the wrong choice. $50 a month is 600 bucks a year, 600 bucks on half a million dollars is a yield of just 0.12%. I could invest that half a million dollars, in treasuries and make a better return. Yes. Yes. True story. That's a fact true story. But Dr. Sir, Parik Patel doesn't understand something.

luxury cars like audis bmws and jaguars here as well"", ""yes i'll leave links to those in the description those of you who have used jobs boards before will know that they tend to be a bit of a feeding frenzy by that i mean it's just hundreds of people spamming resumes to every open position and that means the likelihood of yours being noticed among the noise is pretty low although using a cryptocurrency job board is not necessarily a lost cause i strongly recommend going to the source specifically to the website of the crypto company offering that position this should theoretically increase the chances that your application will actually get read by the almighty gatekeeper if you don't see any jobs on these crypto jobs boards that you like or think you qualify for your next stop is the website of the crypto projects and crypto companies you know and love cryptocurrency exchanges like binance and coinbase are always hiring and they usually have their own dedicated jobs portals on their websites even us here at the coin bureau have our own jobs page link to that is in the description by the way if you're not sure if the crypto company you're interested in is hiring you can always reach out to them via twitter or telegram and ask them you might be surprised to find that they have a vacancy available and that you seem to be the right person for the job on that note if you are an active member of a cryptocurrency community you may already be on the cusp of clinching a crypto career as many of you will know the hottest crypto trend of 2020 was to become a decentralized autonomous organization even though most cryptocurrency projects transitioned to daos to sidestep any potential regulatory issues this simultaneously opened up some serious opportunities for the members of their communities this is because many dows have treasuries that are used to fund initiatives that are beneficial to their ecosystem if you're an active community member of a dow operated cryptocurrency you probably have the gravitas you would need to pass a proposal that would give you a part-time job while adding value to your favorite crypto project some community-run cryptocurrency projects like secret network even offer a path to what is essentially a career as a high-ranking community member if all else fails there's one last place you can check twitter there are a handful of twitter accounts that post cryptocurrency jobs as they're made available just enable account notifications on their twitter profiles and let that slow drip of crypto jobs come in i'll leave links to a couple of those in the description to wrap things up i want to give you a few tips to help you in your crypto career first tip trust your gut if you're just getting started in the crypto industry then chances are that you will get hired by a new crypto company that's also just getting started as you'll see not all these new crypto companies are entirely legit and some of them engage in some seriously shady practices what's more is that some of these new crypto companies are well funded which can give you the illusion that what they're doing is okay when you start wondering if you've accidentally stepped into the crypto underworld do not hesitate to go out and find another job second tip be personable and perceptive i really can't stress just how small the cryptocurrency space is you should do your best to be on good terms with your colleagues and actively engage with the other people who work in your crypto niche again be wary of any bad actors who drain your time and make you feel uncomfortable there's no shortage of scammers in cryptocurrency even at its highest levels you can learn more about common cryptocurrency scams by clicking up there in the top right of the video third tip consider becoming a freelancer for those who didn't know when you're a bona fider employee the company you work for usually has to shell out an ungodly amount of tax on any money they're paying you when you do that same job as a freelancer however they can write off the work you do as a business expense this means that instead of increasing their tax bill you're reducing it instead consequently the money that they pay you as a freelancer or contractor is often much more than the money they would have paid you as an employee the trade-off is that you have no job security no paid vacation and must also be responsible for paying your own tax even then the tax you pay will be minimal compared to the income you take home and you probably wouldn't be able to take much paid vacation anyways whilst we're in a bull market and then when the bull market ends any sort of job security you thought you had will probably go out of the window as a freelancer you can also leave at any time which can come in handy if you start to suspect the crypto company you're working for is actually a ponzi scheme whatever you do do not use websites like upwork to find work in the cryptocurrency space you'll be paid very little assuming you even land the gig just apply for a crypto job as you normally would and note in the application that you're willing to work as a contractor now this conveniently brings me to my fourth and final tip and that is to know your worth for the time being you do not have to compete with very many people to get a job in crypto this means that it's easy for you to become the undisputed master of your niche if you get hired somewhere hence why you're usually able to move up the ranks quickly in almost any crypto company once you get the sense that you've achieved some sort of mastery do not hesitate to demand what you believe to be fair compensation for your work again this will be much easier to do if you're a freelancer because any extra money you're requesting can be written off as a tax deductible expense by the crypto company you're working for trust me i've been there there are lots of pros to working in the cryptocurrency space in addition to being protected from global pandemics working in crypto means working in an industry that's growing just as exponentially as the coins and tokens it revolves around the constant developments lawsuits and drama guarantee that you'll never get bored either i can attest to that even though you're going to have to work your ass off could lose your job when the bull market ends i reckon the pros outweigh the cons after all it seems that you only get one shot at life and being on the cutting edge of the most disruptive technology in the world seems like a good way to spend that time the best part is the crypto world is yours for the taking there are literally thousands of crypto jobs just waiting to be filled and almost all of them require nothing more than some knowledge about crypto some experience with a few crypto products perhaps a few language skills and the ability to play nice with others there are plenty of crappy wage slave jobs with much higher barriers to entry and i certainly can't name a single regular job that doesn't demand at least one or two years of previous work experience it still blows my mind that some crypto jobs don't require any work experience whatsoever"", ""it's a great place for up-and-comers to define themselves in now that said there are specialist positions out there that will have higher requirements don't imagine yourself becoming a blockchain developer if you don't know how to code for example but for those looking to grow with the flow it could be just what you're looking for like the cryptocurrency market the cryptocurrency jobs space is a wild west's in some regard in that there are opportunities out there for those willing to seek them out and make them their own it can be easy to get lost between job boards website postings community initiatives and job bots on twitter sometimes you might even find yourself accidentally working for a corrupt crypto company all you have to do is trust your gut get close to good people and stay far away from the bad ones you should also consider becoming a freelancer to maximize your profits this will bring in more cash and make it easier to argue for more i consider myself a prime example of someone who realized their worth i quit my wage slave office job and went all in on crypto and look at me now guy the crypto guy if you enjoyed this video why don't

underlying performance of the business had actually continued to improve pretty significantly and uh at that point Norbert Lou actually flew to Argentina to argue his case basically saying that if you were to rerun the numbers through the exact same formula that was used to calculate the original 67 offer that the family did um the number per share would be much higher because the business is now producing more cash than it was when that 67 initial offer happened so um the kind of final part of the story is that in December 2007 the minority shareholders including norberlu and punch card Capital accepted an offer for 82.50 per ADR which made it nearly a 5x investment in just over three years now for me there is a huge amount to learn from the story for Norbert Lou I've tried to strip it down to basically five different points here the first one is learn from Charlie Charlie Munger you know shared this reverse engineering of Coca-Cola Norbert Lou referred to it as basically the best stock write-up ever even though that probably wasn't really the point from Charlie Munger and Norbert Lou was able to apply a lot of the Coca-Cola type ideas to you know a beer company in Argentina of all things in it"", ""it's almost a religious duty he's sacrificing short-term profits for long-term success now coming into 2001 where our kind of records start here charlie munger already had a big position in costco and we can see that in the first decade of the 2000s he probably increased his position about 60 or so so he would have purchased costco at a range of different prices and looking back through costco's history it looked like he probably purchased at the absolute low point maybe 12 or 13 times earnings and at the kind of higher point maybe 25 to even getting close to 30 times earnings kind of at the upper limit so this really isn't a cigar investment it's a growing business that has great reinvestment opportunities and that is what really generated the strong returns here for manga manga of course been famous for buying great businesses at reasonable prices as opposed to reasonable businesses at great prices has said over the years that over the very long term for businesses retaining most of the earnings your return will tend towards the return on equity of the business and if we look at the return on invested capital for costco so this isn't return on equity return on investor capital uh will be kind of agnostic of whether costco had any debt through the years which was kind of pushing up their return on equity but if we look at that history uh return on investor capital was in the nine or ten percent range for costco in the early 2000s and in the uh second decade of the 2000s and um the kind of little bit of the 2020s that we've had so far costco has been able to lift that return on invest capital over time to in the kind of mid to high teens and of course valuation matters it matters a lot but uh the reinvestment engine can do some pretty wonderful things for the underlying business of costco and of course for investors as well now this is actually something that warren buffett wrote about in his article how inflation swindles the equity investor he talked about reinvestment engines in businesses and costco is a great example of that and charlie munger probably paid somewhere in the one and a half to maybe as high as three times book value sort of range he was paying a premium to book value on what was largely kind of physical tangible assets and on the surface of things that can look very expensive but as buffett explained in that 1970s inflation article companies that have the opportunity to reinvest capital can generate really good returns even if you pay a premium to their book value think about it like a very high quality or a very high interest bond you know costco has generated about a 10 return on invested capital in the early 2000s growing now to getting close to 20 returns on invested capital in the second decade or so of the uh 2000s and costco has this kind of weird uh ability to be able to continue reinvesting capital and and opening new stores now if costco was a bond that would be like having this weird bond that pays an unusually high rate of interest that bond would generally sell well above par value in the market if that was truly the case and this bond with costco has the other unusual characteristic where you can take your annual interest payments and you can reinvest them at par value you know not necessarily at this premium to book they're able to take your share of the underlying earnings for the business and instead of paying you a dividend costco actually does pay dividend as well but the proportion of the earnings they retain they're essentially able to reinvest at really really attractive rates much more attractive rates than you would be able to if you took your dividend payment and just put it back into some sort of you know dividend reinvestment program"", ""Norbert Lou noted that you can identify certain business momentums in the real world that aren't necessarily the financials and allow for sustained High Returns on Capital now coincidentally around 2004 when Norbert Lou was in the very early days of his fund he actually traveled as part of a holiday to South America and to Argentina and he noticed a very dominant kind of beer brand in uh kilmirs I believe I'm pronouncing that correctly he basically said I remember seeing it everywhere sometimes alternatives to that brand were not even available he'd previously spent quite a bit of time basically just learning about beer businesses and reading annual reports of giant very highly valued beer companies like Anheuser-Busch and like Heineken but he'd never made an investment in any of those companies basically just because they they look too expensive but in the summer of 2004 he actually came across a press release from a company called quincer which owns the uh Kilmer's beer brand essentially and the first release explained that they were looking to pursue something called a Dutch Tinder offer for a large portion of their shares which is essentially just when a company tries to do a very large purchase oftentimes buying out quite substantial shareholders for essentially the lowest price they they can and this is what really prompted Norbert Lou to look much closer at the underlying company now there were a few things that kind of initially jumped out to Norbert Lou firstly there really were a lot of people that were turned off to the idea of investing in a place like Argentina they were very high interest rates there was a lot of inflation and the stock market had kind of just been depressed for a long period of time but for that reason when he looked at the kind of quincer company he saw that it traded at about six times operating earnings which made it just about the cheapest beer company he had ever seen you know trading at a much much lower multiples of earnings than companies like Heineken and Anheuser-Busch and so on he mentions in the out article that a critical thing was having some belief that just because it's Argentina doesn't mean you can't have a good company and if the country blows up it doesn't mean all the companies will be a disaster so after a deeper dive into the company Norbert Lou basically discovered three different things that made it a really interesting potential investment case firstly he found that Quincy had massive market share they'd been around since 1888 they had 80 market share in Argentina and almost 100 market share in Bolivia Paraguay and Uruguay and he was kind of asking himself the question you know why is that and to a significant extent he said one of the things that's so special about beer is this natural tendency for the industry to consolidate and for all the advantages to accrue to the largest player he noted that lots of consumers tended to identify with a particular beer brand you know in the U.S someone might identify as a Budweiser Drinker for example as as something that he mentioned and he mentioned that as the brands kind of start to build and scale up the sort of the self-reinforcing process where uh the beer brands that have the most sales tend to have larger advertising budgets that tends to lead to more sales it tends to lower their cost of production because they can scale into much larger production facilities and it just makes it really hard for other beer brands to compete essentially even very well capitalized International competitors can come into a market with their you know fancy new beer brand and they're going to find it really challenging to displace the beer brand that already has significant market share and that consumers are really identifying with personally all of that resulted in a couple of different things it meant that Quinta had about 60 Returns on invested capital and you know that survived a very long time they were founded in 1888 that survived Wars military coups and hyperinflation and the third thing that Norbert Lou really liked about the business is he felt that it had a degree of untapped pricing power he explains that for most companies in order to increase your Revenue you tend to have to kind of increase your expenses as well whether it's marketing or producing more units of whatever you're selling but he said with a small minority of companies you do have true pricing power you can put up the price of your products without necessarily having a material impact on the volume of that product that you're able to sell and if you can increase your prices and keep your expenses relatively flat that can do great things for operating margins and operating profits he noted two things with this particular company in relation to pricing power firstly people identify very strongly with the brand of beer that they drink and they're more than happy to pay a modest premium to other you know competitive Brands if they can drink the brand that they identify with and that they're used to and he also said that the bimberg family who had controlled the company for several decades had actually for a long time been raising the price at a far slower rate than simply the rate of inflation and for that reason he believed it was quite a bit of sort of latent pricing power built in here now the final sort of complicating factor that was happening at more of a kind of corporate level as opposed to the qualitative aspects of the business was that there was this quite complex uh put call agreement between the bimberg family who controlled most of the shares in this company and ambiv and it essentially meant two things one uh the benberg family had the right to sell this steak and the ambiv company had the right to buy those same shares at certain times in the future and after doing some kind of deep digging into various SEC filings and so on uh Norbert Lou was basically able to find that the price at which those transactions could potentially happen was very heavily influenced by the ebitdar of the business so you had kind of of a lot of things really aligning here for Norbert Lou you had basically the world's cheapest beer company you had a very dominant Market position you've got the lowest cost beer producer in the region because of their immense scale you've got untapped pricing power you've got a family looking to sell for the first time in Generations you've got that family incentivized to maximize earnings more than ever the simplest way to do that of course is to tap into some of that latent pricing power and all of these factors working in harmony created a very very compelling investment case for Norbert Lou now in terms of the timeline here Norbert Lou was doing most of this research in mid 2004 and the sort of price increase in game had actually already started back in 2003 so in 2003 um prices were bumped 10 percent in March another 10 in September and then another 10 throughout 2004 and throughout that period of time uh Norbert Lou's sort of pricing our latent pricing power theory was actually proven correct you know as the prices were being bumped up by by the company for this brand of beer the overall volume was actually still going up as well so there wasn't any notable impact at all on sales volume even with pretty significant price increases now interestingly there was actually an ADR listed in the US for quincer I guess a little bit like some of the Chinese technology companies today like Alibaba jd.com and so on they have American depository receipts listed on American stock exchanges so Norbert Lou was able to access ownership in the company kind of through that vehicle and he put on a 15 position in the punch card Capital portfolio in August of 2004 paying 17 per ADR in 2004 the company's ebitdar grew 48 in 2005 it grew another 40 percent uh prices kept increasing volumes kept growing and the operating kind of margins here for this business kept expanding very rapidly following that quite a few things happened firstly our Norbert Lou increased his position to about 20 and the fund""]"
